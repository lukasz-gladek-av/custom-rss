            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/forza-horizon-4-is-being-delisted-15-december-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playground Games has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a> will be delisted from sale late this year on 15th December 2024, thanks to those pesky “licensing and agreements with our partners”. Between now and then, the game will be going on a steep discount, with the possibility to grab a game token for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> players who bought any kind of DLC for the game.</p>
<p>This discounted pricing hasn’t been announced or put into place on Xbox yet, but Forza Horizon 4 is 80% off on Steam at £10.99, while the Ultimate Edition with DLC is now £16.99. <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ">All standalone DLC has already been delisted</a>, so the only way to get the Fortune Island and LEGO Speed Champions DLC packs are to buy the Ultimate Edition.</p>


<p>Xbox Game Pass players who purchased DLC content and who had an active subscription yesterday, 25th June 2024, will receive&nbsp;a game token through the Xbox Message Center that will be delivered in the coming days to turn it into a full digital license for the game.</p>
<p>With the game being delisted, the next Festival Playlist will be its last. Series 77 will run from 25th July through to 22nd August, with the usual smorgasbord of weekly challenges and activities to take part in. After that point the festival playlist history will stay in the game, but players will be skipped through to the Festival Site screen instead of to the Playlist. There will also still be daily and weekly challenges in the game.</p>
<p>This final Series will be the last chance to earn the following Achievements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Creature of Habit – Complete all Seasonal Championships in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Stunt Puller – Complete all Seasonal PR Stunts in a Festival Playlist Series.</li>
<li>Cashing In – Earn 1 Season Completion Bonus.</li>
<li>Perfectionist – Earn all 8 Season Completion Bonuses in the same Series.</li>
<li>Encore? – Complete all activities in a single Festival Playlist Series.</li>
</ul>
<p>Forza games being delisted used to be a yearly occurrence in the late 2010s, as licensing for music and/or cars expired on a game-by-game basis. However, there’s been a lull since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/30/forza-motorsport-7-delisting-september-big-sale-discount-offer-xbox-game-pass/">Forza Motorsport 7’s delisting in 2021</a>, and Forza Horizon 4 stayed relevant at the start of the Xbox Series X|S generation thanks to a native port to the new generation, before Forza Horizon 5 arrived two years later. As game releases have spread out, it’s possible that Microsoft has signed longer licensing deals, so that the 2018 game will have had a healthy six years on sale, as opposed to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/12/forza-horizon-3-delisted-september-games-with-gold-possible/">Horizon 3’s four</a>. Additionally, the latest Forza Motorsport is set to be a longer-lasting racing platform, so licensing deals will have been made to take that intention into account.</p>
<p>Of course, Forza Horizon 4 will still be totally playable after it’s been delisted, and it remains a real highlight of the series to date. Launching in 2018 for Xbox One and Xbox One X, it was a fantastic visual showcase that toured a rendition of Northern England and Scotland. In our review, Dom said, “The opening alone, which takes you through Forza’s beautiful changing of the seasons, forced me to quite unknowingly smile like a buffoon a number of times despite my default malaise of British apathy, and the game continued to force this cheery outpouring from me for hours upon hours. So, it’s good. Unless you don’t like smiling. Horizon 4 is fuelled by the same anarchic arcade racing streak as previous entries in the series, but its new additions ensure it remains firmly at the head of the pack.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-sliced-permanently.911910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-price-drop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a permanent&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em>&nbsp;price drop, so if you missed out on one of 2024's best games, now's your chance to pick it up.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/price-drop" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted by PCGamesN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is now $10 cheaper across all platforms, and you'll probably be able to find it at a lower price if you're picking it up physically now as well.</p>
<p>PCGamesN asked Ubisoft about the price drop, and the studio confirmed that the change "is permanent" rather than being due to a sale, so you don't need to worry about missing out on this deal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=RuK9DPuE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-price-drop-boss.jpg?itok=7K8XiFDN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of 2024's best games is now permanently cheaper.</figcaption></figure><p>No reason was given for the price drop, but we can make some educated guesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam in August, so it's possible Ubisoft wants to lower the price to make the game more enticing for Steam players. It's likely a launch discount will also be applied to further attract Steam users at launch.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Ubisoft believes it got the price for the game wrong the first time around and wants to make an adjustment to put the game more in line with some of its fellows, although it's still not as cheap as the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Hollow Knight</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1809540/Nine_Sols/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Nine Sols</em></a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a real win-win for anyone who's yet to check this game out, because&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is one of the most underrated games of the year already, and we're only in June.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar,&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>is a 2.5D Metroidvania with a heavy emphasis on acrobatic platforming and combat.</p>
<p>You play as Sargon, a warrior of the Persian Immortals who must travel to the mystical Mount Qaf in order to save the captured Prince Ghassan. Along the way, you'll engage in classic&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia</em>-style platforming challenges, take on massive bosses, and upgrade your abilities in true Metroidvania fashion.</p>
<p><i>The Lost Crown&nbsp;</i>might be a single-player experience, but there's still plenty of new stuff on the horizon for it, including a new chunk of single-player DLC that was announced during the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everything-announced-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">Ubisoft Forward showcase</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751000/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/9NBV5QFW83WC" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and after the price drop, I'd heartily recommend you do. If you still need convincing, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space">check out our review</a> to find out why this one's a real banger.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War Warhammer 3</a> team at Creative Assembly just put out a new video, shedding some light on what to expect for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game’s</a> next DLC and the game in general going forward. Upcoming expansions will focus heavily on the Immortal Empires megamap campaign, and there were lord and unit reveals for the Ogres, Greenskins, and Khorne factions that headline the next DLC - slated for the "back end of the year". Certain party poopers among you will be pleased to know that I cannot accurately refer to the 17 minute video below as a “tray-tray”.</p>

<p>To kick things off, game director Rich Aldridge spoke of plans to “continue in the mold” of Thrones Of Decay’s pricing scheme, which split the factions into three separate, cheaper purchases. As for the shape the expansions might take, Aldridge said that “the big news is that you’ve shown us where the importance of the game is, and that’s Immortal Empires". The "next DLCs will be focused on Immortal Empires specifically,” although this doesn’t mean they’ll stop supporting the smaller Realms of Chaos campaign in terms of balancing and bug fixes. I do hope this means bringing some of the more focused narrative campaigns into the wider sandbox with things like worldwide story events. A hopelessly addicted man can dream.</p>
<p>On the upcoming DLC: It’s an ogre-haul, baby! Aldridge confirmed that the new Legendary Lord - or subfaction leader, if you’re new around these parts - will be the long-suspected Golfag Maneater. He’s a travelin’ man(eater), fond of exploring the world and finding strange and new cultures to eat. There will be more characters revealed later, but the video does spoil a few of the new units: the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Thundertusk">Thundertusk</a>, which is actually an ice-type unit, confusingly, and <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Blood_Vultures">Blood Vultures</a>. These look to fill the ‘annoying flying unit’ archetype common among many factions. Not especially sexy, but with a huge amount of battlefield utility.</p>
<p>Next up, it’s Khorne. The legendary lord is <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/U%27Zhul_the_Skulltaker">U'Zhul the Skulltaker</a>, who I’d describe as an angry red man if that narrowed it down at all. Let me try again: he collects skulls. Nope, still too vague. He likes <em>interesting</em> skulls, like a mad stamp collector. Ok, that’s fun. Maybe he’ll get a lord skull trophy rack? Maybe Queek can get the same one! I’ve somehow turned this into a conversation about rats and I don’t care. For Khorne’s new units, they showed off the <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Slaughterbrute">Slaughterbrute</a> (Big, Red, Angry, like a daemonic Kool-Aid man).</p>

<p>Next up, it’s your boys and mine, the Greenskins. For the LL, it’s <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Gorbad_Ironclaw">Gorbad Ironclaw</a>. We haven’t had a boar-mounted orc lord yet (or indeed, any DLC orc lords, they’ve all been gobbos), so this is interesting to me, an enjoyer of furry pigs. They also suggest a diverse new roster, including not-so-subtly confirming a <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Colossal_Squig">Colossal Squig</a> on the horizon.</p>
<p>In terms of free bits, Aldrige reaffirms a return to the free LL format, last seen with Nurgle’s Epidemius. This time, it’s another Khorne lord, though they’re staying schtum on which one.</p>
<p>As for details on future content, Alridge says that getting the rest of the Chaos gods fleshed out is the main priority, which more than likely means Slaanesh is next. He also suggests sooner-rather-than-later updates for Vampire Counts, Norsca, and - happy days! - the glorious Lizardmen’s not-so-glorious Geomantic Web.</p>
<p>My high level take on the video is: it's great to see Rich Aldridge in the flesh and chatting about the game! Rich and his team have always felt like the beating heart of all that's great about the series, and even if it's still marketing, it's a fine choice to highlight his team talking about a game they're evidently brimming with passion for.</p>
<p>If you don’t fancy waiting, a quick reminder that Khorne got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/todays-total-war-warhammer-3-patch-has-that-large-red-khorne-dog-your-ordered-plus-a-new-competitive-multiplayer-mode">a free dog</a> this week (angry, red). A quick reminder, also, that a former Creative Assembly developer<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> recently took to Medium</a> to allege a culture of mismanagement and “limited by design” AI, dating back to the launch of Rome 2.</p>

Alexander told <em>Kotaku </em>through a DM that he, as well as Twitter users @Swirlymark, @rnaidens, @sexdisrespecter, @FlingLatraniz16, @Dorkp0rk, @beelolbop, and one anonymous fan, all came together to place these images in one of the busiest areas of New York City because they thought it “would be really funny.” But Alexander also says he believes Venture deserves “more love and recognition” within the <em>Overwatch </em>community.</p><p>“I really like Venture’s personality,” Alexander said. “They’re so energetic and fun!

Prince Jacaerys (Harry Collett) meets with Cregan Stark (Tom Taylor) on top of the Wall and accepts the best fighters that Lord Stark can dispense for Team Black. It’s comforting to be back on the Wall and hear a Northern drawl warning that “winter is coming.”</p><p>Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best), after dragon-watching the blockade of trade routes to King’s Landing, gets into it with a raving Daemon (Matt Smith), who questions her loyalty to Team Black. Daemon continually tries to assert his dominance but is reminded of his low rank. “It is a command,” he yells at Rhaenys. “Would that you were the King,” she tosses back.</p><p>In Drismarck, Lord Coryls (Steve Toussaint) assesses the state of the shipping fleet and meets Alyn, the sailor who saved his life. Then the “enduring mystery,” Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) ominously tells King Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) about fearing “the rats.”</p><p>Of course, rats surround King’s Landing. Lord Larys (Matthew Needham) exterminates Otto Highwater’s spies in another ploy to have Queen Consort Alicent Hightower (Olivia Cooke) owe him. When Alicent isn’t worrying about the impending war or her alliance with her father, she’s finally getting hers with Kings Guard commander Criston Cole (Fabian Frankel). Alicent is no angel, but after years of bedding a pus-filled King Corpse, she deserves a ride or two.</p><p>The Team Green council meeting goes awry with too many cooks in the kitchen (one being the 4-year-old heir that Aegon decided to bring to work). Aegon flounders as king. He can’t even resolve a small-time farming dispute, let alone enact his Dragon v Dragon war plan. Naturally, Aegon’s woeful leadership and need to be liked by the masses makes him the perfect puppet for Alicent and Otto to control. But the sneaky Larys starts campaigning to be Aegon’s new Hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-recommend-id="image://2c8efdfa7f031233090182d05c0769cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1778" data-height="1180" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Queen Rhaenrya stands overlooking the water.

Her palpable grief turns into a stern call to action as she delivers her only line in the entire episode, “I want Aemond Targaryen.”<br></p><p>Daemon heeds the call and cuts a deal with Miseryia (Sonoya Mizuno) to identify ratcatchers. He hires the disgruntled Blood and Cheese to kill Aemond. But Blood and Cheese throw out their original plan when they stumble upon the King’s heirs and the Oracle Helaena in the nursery. “A son for a son” is just as good in their eyes as they force Helaena to point out the male heir and slaughter him (thankfully off camera). The episode ends with Helaena clutching her daughter and fleeing for help.</p><p>Any hesitation from either Alicent or Rhaenerya about going headlong into war is squashed by their need to dole out Hammurabi’s Code: Eye for an Eye. Son for a Son. Heir for an Heir. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/official/20240625/40185_1163105.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a> today, the Marvel Rivals team finally announced that the anticipated Closed Beta will release on July 23, 2024.</p>

"Indeed, this 1,000%," Pilestedt said. "Good game design is evoking emotion more than anything."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A game for everyone is a game for no one.</p><p>Always cater to a select audience.</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1805317649628348612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>X/Twitter user @Indoor_Carrot responded, saying "the problem with this design philosophy is it only caters to a select audience. I tried Dark Souls 1. After defeating the first couple of bosses, I realized it wasn't fun or rewarding. I only felt relief, not accomplished. I stopped playing Dark Souls because of this."</p><p>Pilestedt disagreed. "A game for everyone is a game for no one," he said, which is essentially the motto of his developer Arrowhead Game Studios. "Always cater to a select audience."</p><p>FromSoftware games like Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice are famously difficult but have been praised across the board for their overall game design, challenge included.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">IGN's Shadow of the Erdtree review awarded it a 10/10</a>, for example. "Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single player expansions," we said. "It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark role-playing game, condenses it into a relatively compact 20 to 25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on."</p><p>But some who've purchased the expansion have expressed frustration at the difficulty, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">even review bombing it on Steam because of it and performance issues</a>. Regardless, FromSoftware boss and Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki has remained true to his vision, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-making-elden-ring-easier-would-break-the-game-as-shadow-of-the-erdtree-launches">saying making things easier would "break the game."</a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

One of the new kids on the block is the Nacon Revolution 5 Pro, a controller designed to offer a more premium experience. Normally $200, you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Officially-Licensed-PlayStation-Controller-5/dp/B0CLBLFDBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get it for $175 right now at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846189413506010154%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-great-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6524508%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><h2>Nacon Revolution 5 Pro PS5 and PC Controller</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324992"></a><figcaption>Nacon Revolution 5 Pro controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4324992-nacon-pro-revolution.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Officially-Licensed-PlayStation-Controller-5/dp/B0CLBLFDBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $175 ($<strike>200</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1846189413506010154%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-great-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-lowest-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6524508%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy (Black model only)</a> -- $175 ($<strike>200</strike>)</li></ul><p>There is some great technology under the hood of the Revolution 5 Pro. It has Hall Effect joysticks to help keep stick drift at bay, trigger-locks to decrease the travel distance on each pull, four customizable Omron micro-switch back paddles, interchangeable weights, and several swappable thumbsticks. Interestingly, the D-Pad on this controller was created in partnership with professional fighting game player Mister Crimson, so if you're a Street Fighter 6 or Mortal Kombat 1 player, you might want to check this out. If the exotic design doesn't appeal to you, you can swap it out for a more traditional D-pad.</p><p>For compatibility, the Revolution 5 Pro will work on PS5, PS4, and PC. It has up to 10 hours of battery life from a full charge, and if you're running low on juice, you can switch to a wired mode using the included USB-C to USB-A cable. It comes in two colors, white and black.</p><hr><h2>Alternative high-end gaming controllers</h2><p>The Revolution 5 Pro is in competition with several other pro-style PlayStation controllers. Most notably, there's the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DualSense Edge</a></strong>, PlayStation's premium first-party controller which costs $199. Another alternative is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BQ1PDR4R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</a></strong>, which is on sale for $230 (was $250). The Razer Wolverine V2 Pro is a really nice controller with a chunky design, making it great for anyone with big hands. This PS5 and PC controller has inputs with a shorter actuation distance for quicker button presses and an 8-way microswitch D-pad.</p><p>While it's not on sale, the $174+ <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PDP-Victrix-Wireless-Controller-Playstation-5/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PDP Victrix Pro BFG</a></strong> is a stellar customizable controller. This one has the conventional pro-style features--four back buttons, trigger locks, etc.--but it also has a modular design that lets you swap the position of the left analog stick to offer aligned or offset layouts. There's also a six-button module that's great for fighting games. With multiple D-pad styles and detachable thumbstick caps, the Victrix Pro BFG is a well-rounded PlayStation and PC controller--it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3PJKRV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available for Xbox/PC</a>--that's well worth considering. In fact, it's one of our top picks for DualSense and Elite Series 2 alternatives on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">best PS5 controllers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/" data-ref-id="1100-6473486">best Xbox controllers</a> lists.</p><p>If you are thinking of getting a high-end controller primarily for PC, we'd recommend the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B07SFKTLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2</a></strong> controller instead.

It's a flashy marketing term for an overhauled physics and collision system that aims to make hits and collisions look and feel more powerful. Madden NFL 25 also has enhanced tackling and rushing systems, improvements to the hit stick, and better pass-protection adjustments for QBs.</p><p dir="ltr">The game also has multiple commentary teams this year, with the tenured pair of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis being joined by Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen, as well as Kate Scott and Brock Huard. Also new for the game is the ability to create a female head coach for your fantasy team.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - New Season 4 Reloaded Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3, weapon balancing is revealed for multiplayer, including a major nerf for the powerful Kar98k marksman rifle. The update removed hipfire aim-assist properties and decreased the strength of ADS aim assist properties for controller input devices. The developer says these changes to controller aim assist properties were to align the Kar98k with the sniper rifle class.</p><p dir="ltr">The overpowered akimbo variant of the Lockwood Mk2 is also nerfed. This nerfs the gun's JAK Wardens Conversion Kit, decreasing the maximum damage range by 33% and the near-medium damage range by 20%.</p><p dir="ltr">The midseason update includes a few multiplayer map adjustments as well. Rundown now has improved consistency with bullet penetration on low-wall surfaces, and multiple areas were adjusted on Season 4's Tokyo map to fix places where enemy nameplates could be seen through walls. Exploits were fixed on Scrapyard and Terminal that previously allowed players to interact with Demolition objectives from an unintended location.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says changes were made to the Mortar Strike to make the killstreak more difficult to run from and avoid. The adjustments removed the two-second delay between when the target is marked and mortar fire begins, decreased mortar travel time by 25%, decreased the delay between mortars, and added an increased number of mortars per wave from four to six.</p><p dir="ltr">For Ranked Play, the MTZ-556 and the Holger 556 assault rifles are now unrestricted and available to use for competitive play.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's update also includes a nerf to the Kar98k. This adjustment includes the same change for controller input to align the marksman rifle with snipers, but it also decreases the maximum damage range from 63.5 meters down to 55.88 meters, and reduces the bullet velocity from 660 to 620 meters per second.</p><p dir="ltr">The MCW assault rifle is buffed to make it more viable in Season 4. The minimum damage is increased from 22 to 24, and the bullet velocity is raised from 710 to 750 meters per second.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4's overpowered C4 lethal equipment is nerfed. C4 now has decreased maximum damage from 275 to 200, decreased outer damage from 137 to 100, and a lowered maximum radius from 7 to 6.5 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> can be found here, as shared by Activision.</p><h3>NEW MAPS</h3><p>Incline (6v6)</p><p>Explore a research outpost in the mountains of Urzikstan in Incline, an original snow map featuring intense fights in hostile weather.</p><p>Das Gross (6v6)</p><p>In this horrifying map variant of Das Haus, blood drips from the walls, and sharp, pointed teeth protrude from exposed muscle.</p><p>Bitvela (6v6)</p><p>Visit a pixel-art-inspired variant of the classic Favela in the Bit Party Playlist.</p><p>G3T_H1GH3R</p><p>Get High returns with a new course full of obstacles and surprises.

When you enter an Unstable Rift, you'll face increasingly intense waves of enemies.

If you miss the chance to join a Rift, Strike Team Operators can locate additional opportunities on the map.</p><p>Beware, Unstable Rifts are unpredictable. Some things work differently; some advantages are given, and others taken away. However, the loot is worth it: a maxed-out Pack-A-Punch weapon with maximum Rarity to use while in the Rift, plus free Perks and Upgrades to help you face the hordes.</p><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Fixed inaccurate weapon ammo counts being displayed on the HUD.</li><li>Addressed an issue causing parties of three or more to become stuck while matchmaking.</li><li>Camo unlock requirements for Melee weapons will no longer display inconsistently.</li><li>Resolved an issue with notifications repeating and replicating for some unlocks.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>The Prestige 14 Zombies calling card challenge "Run 'Em Down" (Pickup Artist) now tracks properly.</li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp; ATTACHMENTS</h3><p>Submachine Guns</p><ul><li>Lachmann Shroud  <ul><li>JAK Decimator Conversion Kit  <ul><li>Pack-a-Punch will no longer remove the full-auto firing capability.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Sniper Rifles</p><ul><li>Equipping an explosive ammunition will no longer prevent Ammo Mods from being activated.</li></ul><h2>WARZONE GAMEPLAY</h2><h3><b><u>NEW</u></b></h3><p>» Urzikstan | All Modes «</p><ul><li><b>Specialist Perk</b><ul><li>Recently reintroduced to Resurgence, this all-powerful Perk is now available on Urzikstan!

		<p>The SteamWorld series is a little bit like the sprawling menagerie of Pixar films. While these games share a particular steampunk style and aesthetic, developer Image &amp; Form has consistently surprised and delighted as they explore different genres and game styles with each and every game. Almost. Just like Pixar being lured back for Toy Story, Cars and Monsters Inc. sequels, SteamWorld is also returning to one of its most popular stomping grounds with SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Heist II | Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JArPke5KNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original SteamWorld Heist arrived in 2015, tipping the turn-based strategy XCOM-like format on its side, quite literally. Instead of having a birds eye view of proceedings, moving characters on an isometric world grid, the game switched to a side-scrolling 2D view, putting a lot more emphasis on layers and elevation, as well as player skill as opposed to percentage hit chances.</p>


<p>Truth be told, as much as I loved its core concept – enough to buy the game three or four times in various deep discount sales –&nbsp;I never actually played SteamWorld Heist for more than a few hours. I might have to try and right this wrong, after settling in for the opening of SteamWorld Heist 2.</p>
<p>Thankfully, while they share a gameplay core, SteamWorld Heist 2 tells a completely new story. Set in a fragment of a planet that’s covered in water and small islands, Steambots are being subjugated by the Royal Navy and their fleet of Dieselbots, the fresh water that they need to survive is becoming ever more scarce, with the salty sea water corroding and destroying any that resort to it.</p>


<p>Enter the hero of the piece, Captain Leeway. Well, actually he’s the one-armed son of the legendary Captain “Krakenbane” Leeway, and has struggled all his life to live up to the expectations of greatness that are heaped upon him. Also his submarine just got commandeered by the Royal Navy, and it’s halfway been stripped for parts.</p>
<p>The game’s opening sees you get to grips with the game’s take on turn-based strategy with some of Leeway’s crew –&nbsp;it was his gun-shootin’ arm that got blasted off, so he doesn’t actually do any fighting for himself. Daisy Clutch and Wesley Hotchkiss charge through the Navy’s rank and file, taking cover, ricocheting bullets, chucking grenades and more on their way to securing the sub.</p>
<p>It’s a fun opener that very quickly introduces the game’s core mechanics –&nbsp;characters have two action points, Daisy’s sniper rifle has an aim line that sways and you time your shots while Wesley’s SMG does not, and you’ll want to master bullet ricochet, spot explosive barrels and more. It also builds up to a neat crescendo of a boss encounter against Commander Batterfaux and his big shark-themed mech suit, with big AOE missile strikes that keep you moving while you chip away at it, shattering the windscreen, blasting off the fuel tank, and the like.</p>

<p>From there, missions come in several varieties, from simple ship clearing jobs to races against time as loot threatens to decay, defensive missions to survive a dozen turns, tasks to take out a particular enemy character, and more.</p>
<p>Who you take into a mission is pretty simple to decide early on – you’ve just got Daisy and Wesley until you can recruit some more –&nbsp;but as missions get bigger and your crew grows, you’ll have to choose between characters in different jobs. Brawler, Boomer, Engineer, Sniper, Reaper, and Flanker each come with their specific main weapon and skill tree to work through, but as with many RPG job systems, you’ll eventually be able to switch characters to a different job and mix and match skills and abilities. I’m looking forward to exploring this aspect more as I get deeper into the game.</p>
<p>With SteamWorld Heist 2 diving into the wet stuff, the between mission action is now a fun little sailing game as you pilot the submarine between missions, safe havens where you can rest up and grab upgrades, and battling with smaller Navy ships.</p>

<p>Cap’n Leeway’s sub has been stripped of all its good stuff by the Navy, so you (in)conveniently have to start from scratch, scavenging your first weapon and trying to get air tanks to allow you to submerge again. This ship combat is a neat little diversion with three weapon slots that automatically fire from the front, sides and top of the sub. The initial machine guns I go could blast away to either side, each salvo then needing a little cooldown before it fires again. With how manoeuvrable the submarine is –&nbsp;it practically drifts when turning – I quickly mastered a good little spin trick to fire with one side and then the other to deal with these initial Royal Navy ships in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The sailing overworld is lovely and bright, as you peel back the clouds shrouding the gorgeously azure waters and tropical islands on the opening region – I also love the smooth jazz of the soundtrack in this area. That’s immediately contrasted with the dank and moody interiors of the submarine, ports and enemy ships you raid, though there’s plenty of nice touches to the backdrops. It’s neat to see how Image &amp; Form’s art style has evolved, retaining their long-standing aesthetic, but now seemingly using 3D models as opposed to layered digital art.</p>
<p>I’m still only bobbing on the surface of SteamWorld Heist 2 and the overarching story of Captain Leeway’s redemption arc, the Royal Navy’s incursion and other narrative threads, but there’s also all the depths of the jobs and combat to explore, and I’m keen to dive, dive, dive back in for our review.</p>

		<p>In April this year the developer Poncle announced that Vampire Survivors will be released on PS5 and PS4 in the summer and it’s now officially summer as I have my aircon on, so where is Vampire Survivors?</p>
<p>Well it seems Sony’s submission process, the mechanism that all publishers need to follow to get their games on PlayStation, is causing Poncle a few headaches. It doesn’t seem like there’s anything particularly massive holding things up, just that it’s the first time they have had to do it.</p>


<p>“A<span>s it’s now summer we’ve had a lot of people asking when the PlayStation release will be happening </span><span>&nbsp;we want to keep you all updated, as we still don’t have a release date to share, but wanted to let you know why,” <a href="https://x.com/poncle_vampire/status/1805231013280256451">tweeted Poncle</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“This is the first time we’re going through submission processes on PlayStation so it’s taking a little longer than usual we’re also doing some trial and error on Trophies to ensure we get them right BUT we’ll let you know ASAP when we have a solid date.”</p>

<p>Poncle&nbsp; recently released the Operation Guns DLC, which based on the Contra franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire Survivors: Operation Guns DLC feat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and From Software have released an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update, and if you've been struggling with the DLC's difficulty, this one's for you.</p>
<p>The update is a small one; it doesn't have extensive <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-1-12-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, nor does it make any adjustments to things like boss movesets, so if your woes are related to some of&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s more hair-raising boss moments, you won't find what you're looking for here.</p>
<p>However, this update does make some changes to the Shadow Realm Blessings you can obtain to boost your damage and negate incoming pain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-boss.jpg?itok=ke-DprJf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-boss.jpg?itok=AugMkwOd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If this guy's giving you trouble, help may be available.</figcaption></figure><p>In short, this&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC update increases attack damage and incoming damage negation for "the first half of the maximum amount of Blessing enhancements". The second half will represent a more gradual increase.</p>
<p>Additionally, the final level of Blessings will now grant slightly more attack power and damage negation, so if you're using Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ash, you should notice a difference.</p>
<p>If you're experiencing an unstable frame rate on&nbsp;the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, this update recommends that you check the Ray Tracing setting, which may have defaulted to being switched on if you've loaded your save from previous versions of the game.</p>
<p>Future balance adjustments and bug fixes are coming soon as well, so if these fixes don't smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>experience, don't worry; more changes are on the way.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wryly addressed the controversy on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, suggesting that players utilize their Scadutree Blessings. It feels like the latest update makes that advice even more essential.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

			<p>Nexon and Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/26/the-first-descendant-launches-on-ps5-and-ps4-july-2-new-character-gameplay-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have revealed</a> The First Descendant PS5 graphical features available on Sony's console ahead of the game's launch next week.</p>
<p>The third-person looter shooter from Nexon releases globally across PC and consoles next week on July 2, and ahead of this release, we now know some more about the graphical modes on Sony's console. Although not yet specified, it's likely that these features will also be available on the Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Not yet available in the game's beta, The First Descendant has a new Balanced Mode on PS5. In total, PS5 players will have access to three graphical modes - balanced, performance, and fidelity with the latter focusing on resolution, and the performance mode focusing on higher frame-rates. As you might guess, the Balanced Mode will fit in between these two modes.</p>
<p>On PS5, The First Descendant will also support Ray Tracing as well as AMD Frame Generation and Virtual Shadow Map (VSM), enhancing the game's overall visual quality.</p>
<p>Aside from providing these additional graphical features on PS5, Nexon has also released character gameplay trailers, which we've included below:</p>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5.2, The First Descendant launches next week on July 2nd for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5. On PC, the game will<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-qa-on-the-game-ue5-implementation-and-future-dlss-3-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> support HDR10+</a> Gaming and<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-gets-crossplay-beta-with-dlss-3-support-in-late-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> NVIDIA DLSS 3</a>. Earlier today we talked about our impressions from the game following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-summer-game-fest-impressions-let-the-loot-rain-fall-on-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gameplay session</a> earlier this month. Here's what we wrote about the looter shooter:</p>
<p><em>"For the second portion of my gameplay session, I picked one of the playable regions at random and delved into the arctic region, thinking it to be a good change of pace from the boss arenas although my bunny girl was quite underdressed for the occasion. I had just enough time to eke out a zone recon mission and jump into a few shootouts for loot and glory before my session came to an end. One thing that I'll have to give Nexon praise for is continuing the trend of implementing Korean vocal tracks into your open world exploration. It's a thing I thoroughly enjoyed in Stellar Blade, and I earnestly want the trend to continue."</em></p>

<p id="BW5awf">So, when IDW Publishing and Mattel announced they were partnering for a set of American Girl graphic novels for the kids of the 2020s, I got <em>really</em> excited. Polygon got the chance to read the first, <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, written by Casey Gilly and drawn by Felia Hanakata, before it was released to readers this week. <em>Blue Guitar</em> continues the American Girl tradition of telling fascinating historic stories through a hopeful lens, but it also brings forth a failure inherent in the dolls themselves: their singularity.</p>
<p id="SH4UoM">Gilly and Hanakata are not new to transforming iconic franchises into comic books — between them, they’ve worked on well-received tales in the canon of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, <em>The Dragon Prince</em>, My Little Pony, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, to name a few — so it’s no surprise that <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar </em>is compelling and inventive. </p>
<p id="KgBIPH">The creators build on the history of Julie Albright, a ’70s-era doll introduced in 2007, bringing her story into the 21st century via her diary, which is discovered by the book’s present-day lead, Emma Dhillon, while moving into her new home in San Francisco. This kicks off two parallel tales — one in which Emma makes a documentary about her journey to figure out who Julie is, and Julie and her friends try to solve the mystery of a stolen blue guitar in 1977.</p>

<p id="7cU8TG">To keep the stories straight, Hanakata borders Emma’s sequences in blue and Julie’s in yellow, but I’ll admit I was confused by the premise at first. A panel of Emma and Julie shouting simultaneously while facing each other had me thinking we were time traveling for a moment — but once I settled into the parallel narratives (and the color coding), I didn’t put the book down until I finished it.</p>
<p id="ZrWoEA">It wasn’t just the American Girl nostalgia that kept me turning the page. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. Hanakata’s thick-lined, brightly pigmented representation of Julie is refreshingly modern compared to the photorealistic imagery of her <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americangirl.com%2Fpages%2Fjulie-albright&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24185954%2Famerican-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23949995__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.americangirl.com/pages/julie-albright&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24185954/american-girl-julie-blue-guitar-comic-review&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">on the American Girl website</a>. The pages designed to look like the inside of Julie’s journal make me excited for kids who get to create imaginary worlds for their Julie dolls based on what they learn about her in this book.</p>
<p id="CeVbdo">Julie’s story also centers on her motivation to raise money to benefit the San Francisco Bay oil spill cleanup, which is based on the real-life spill that happened in 1971. In true American Girl form, the last few pages of the book contain information about several real-life historical events that inspired elements of the story.</p>

<p id="HJW0Ax">It’s not only accurate in the historic sense. Gilly and Hanakata aren’t shy about incorporating modern technology and vernacular, which feels like a great way to keep young readers interested. Emma films her documentary on her smartphone, illustrated to look like the UI of a real phone, down to the puppy filter that pops up on Emma’s face in a few scenes. Gilly strikes a nice balance of modernity, sending Emma’s character to the library to look through local yearbooks that don’t exist in digital form, just like Julie’s diary. </p>
<p id="SS6OXm">However, this book throws one of my biggest reservations about American Girl as a now-adult feminist into stark relief. Hanakata’s Emma is short with dark hair that fades to pink at the ends, framing her round face and complementing her relatively chubby build. Julie is consistent with other American Girl artwork of the doll: She’s thin and willowy, with long, blonde hair. </p>

<p id="Z0qNQl">But though you can buy a Julie doll, you can’t buy an Emma doll. I tried to create a custom Emma doll on the American Girl website, but I couldn’t find a hairstyle or color to match, nor could I customize her shorter height and thicker body shape. No matter what, every American Girl doll is predestined to be 18 inches tall with a soft, flat belly and legs that don’t touch. </p>
<p id="j4VwDo">It isn’t that the dolls are particularly harmful in their representation — compared to the wide world of big-brand dolls, they’re not overly skinny, and you can select from a range of skin colors and hair types. But their homogeneity in body type means that, in media like this comic, the dolls are all represented similarly, too. </p>
<p id="LAbMC6">In short: There hasn’t been a fat American Girl doll yet, and it’s past due. For one reason or another, Gilly and Hanakata chose to represent <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>’s main character as having a body dissimilar from Julie’s, and that begs the question: If American Girl’s new graphic novel line can build compelling stories with body diversity, when will American Girl reflect that in its main business?</p>
<p id="XfecaS">The book cashes in on body diversity in a good way — I’m glad young readers will see a smart, intriguing character that might look more like them in American Girl media — but Mattel fails to back it with dolls that purport that value, too. It’s a shame that kids would have to get creative with their dolls to create narratives that match the body diversity in <em>Julie and the Blue Guitar</em>, because the choice to make Emma different makes for a better graphic novel. Why can’t those varying shapes and sizes exist for the dolls, too? </p>

There are over 750 accurately modeled cars from dozens of real-world car manufacturers, each of which will have had to be individually licensed to appear in the game, and during development the end of the contracts they had in place likely seemed impossibly far away to worry about. <em>FH3</em> had only come out two years earlier in 2016, and it’s fair to say the Australian edition of the open-world series—despite being fantastic—didn’t have quite the same impact and longevity. So seven years likely felt more than enough.</p><p>Of course, these new events demonstrate that nothing but in-perpetuity can ever be enough.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-recommend-id="image://e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2690" data-height="1394" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Playground Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-recommend-id="image://e0315e075e575a944d333ce3a93ab09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2690" data-height="1394" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A red car at the start of a snowy race." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Playground and Microsoft are doing everything right, <em>right now</em>, when it comes to <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>.

The companies are encouraging people to ensure they own full copies (rather than accessing it via Game Pass), and have promised that it will remain available to download, and indeed still be playable both offline and online, with multiplayer features maintained. Well, for the short-term, at least.<br></p><p>Playground has also said that those who bought DLC for <em>FH4</em> while playing the Game Pass version will soon—if they have an active, full-price (as in, not discounted) Game Pass subscription right now—receive a “game token,” good through July 2026, to ensure you don’t need to buy it again. It’ll be gone from Game Pass come December 15.<br></p><p>But of course this leaves the enormous question: what about <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>? What about last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-motorsport-8-horizon-xbox-game-pass-review-120fps-1850900323">extraordinary <em>Forza Motorsport</em></a></span>? Will we be saying goodbye forever to these in 2028, 2030? (Again, we’ve asked.)</p><p>It’s worth noting that the release schedules for the <em>Forza</em> games has changed, as the games haven gotten bigger and more involved. For the 2010s, there was an alternating new <em>Horizon</em> or <em>Motorsport</em> every year. They were, in some sense, more “disposable.” But since 2018, we’ve only had two more games. It’s now been three years since there was a new <em>Horizon—</em>the longest gap since the series began in 2012—and there’s not been a mention of <em>FH6</em> during all of the summer reveals. Losing <em>Forza Horizon 4</em> this year is far more impactful as a result.</p><figure id="" data-id="d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-recommend-id="image://d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2744" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Playground Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-recommend-id="image://d1c100ab16553c04e57a84eadc6d901e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2744" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The results of licensing, as a car skids on its side along the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The answer surely has to be to make contingencies around licensing? Yes, I presume it’s actually <em>far</em> easier (while still enormously difficult) to accurately model 750 real cars, than to imagine up 750 entirely original models that don’t conflict with anything that already exists. But also, you know, we don’t actually <em>need</em> 750 cars. 100 would be lots! But at the very least, a suite of cars in the game that <em>are</em> entirely original, store-brand models that represent each of the most enjoyable archetypes, that can be left in the game until the heat-death of the universe. Warn players that everything else has a seven-year (or whatever) shelf-life, and then still have a playable—and more importantly—sellable game at the end of those contracts.<br></p><p> This would absolutely affect those who play these games for the realism, the precise portrayal of cars that offers the all-important simulation aspect. However, it would still allow the gearheads the same length of time with the game as before, but also provide a means to keep selling the product later. Sure, it would lose a lot of its identity, and it’s not a perfect solution. In-perpetuity contracts are the perfect solution. But maybe it’s better than the game never being sold again? </p><p>And this, of course, isn’t aimed exclusively at <em>Forza</em>. This is a common sense approach we desperately need every studio to be implementing when it builds games around licensed properties. It’s miserable that we’re losing so much art down this corporate well, and it’s now, today, impossibly short-sighted to walk into such a situation. (Let alone that these studios are being absolutely screwed over by the licensors, given a game like <em>Forza</em> is the most extraordinary advertising for car manufacturers.)</p><p>Licensing makes all sorts of sense for having a game look or sound flashy, absolutely. But unless in-perpetuity contracts can become the norm, contingencies <em>must</em> be built in from the ground up.</p><p>And hell, there’s no movie you now can’t watch because the lead character drove an Audi. (Indeed, Audi likely paid an enormous wad of cash to have their car appear in the film.) There’s no book that’s unpublishable because the protagonist drank a Coke. We can’t let games keep vanishing from existence for the sake of these short-term deals.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Twenty-year-old New Jersey resident Eric Kang is facing an attempted murder charge after allegedly flying hundreds of miles to attack a fellow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/archeage/">ArcheAge</a> player with a hammer in the wake of an online dispute the two had while playing the game.</p><p dir="ltr">According to police (via <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-jersey-florida-online-video-game-attack/story?id=111380632" rel="nofollow ">ABC News</a>), Kang told his family he was visiting a friend, then boarded a flight to Florida to confront the victim. Wearing black clothes, gloves, and a mask, Kang allegedly entered the victim's home via an unlocked door. Kang waited for the victim--who was gaming at the time--to get up to use the restroom, then attacked him with a hammer.</p><p dir="ltr">The victim--who police say is close in age to his assailant--managed to pin Kang to the ground during the altercation. The victim's stepfather was asleep at the time, but woke up when he heard his stepson calling for help. Together, the two men reportedly subdued Kang until authorities arrived.</p><p dir="ltr">"Upon arrival, [the responding officers] discovered a significant amount of blood in the entryway of the home and the victim's bedroom," Nassau Counter sheriff Bill Leeper said during a recent press conference.</p><p dir="ltr">The victim sustained severe head wounds during the attack, but has been released from the hospital.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked about a motive, Kang reportedly told the sheriff's deputies that the victim is "a bad person online." Leeper stated during the press conference that Kang's charges may be upgraded pending further investigation.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would say, Mr. Kang, it will be a long time before you play video games," Leeper said during the press conference.</p><p dir="ltr">Interestingly, ArcheAge--the Korean MMORPG where Kang met his victim--is shutting down its US servers on Thursday, June 27. This has nothing to do with the assault, and the announcement was made back in April, with a declining active player count cited as the reason for the shutdown.</p><p dir="ltr">"This incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential real-world consequences of online interaction," Leeper said of the assault.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forza-horizon-4-delisting-announcement-prompts-huge-player-surge.911796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playground Games and Microsoft have announced that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from digital storefronts later this year, prompting a massive player surge for the game on PC.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Forza&nbsp;</em>website, Playground says that "due to licensing and agreements with our partners",&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will be taken off digital stores on December 15th, which means you won't be able to buy it digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Playground have confirmed that this delisting doesn't mean you can't play the game if you've already bought it; you'll still be able to download and play&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>if you own it digitally, and you'll be able to access its online features as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=UP3e-UGt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-race.jpg?itok=6AffHvW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will no longer be available to buy digitally later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As of yesterday, you can no longer buy&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>DLC from the store either. You can still buy the Standard, Deluxe, or Ultimate editions of the game until December 14th, however.</p>
<p>Things get a little strange when it comes to Game Pass. Bear with me here, because there are a lot of stipulations.</p>
<p>If you have an "active, full-paid" Game Pass subscription as of June 25th, and you've played&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>through that sub and also&nbsp;bought<em>&nbsp;</em>DLC for it, you should be eligible to get a copy of the game via your Xbox messages.</p>
<p>Sadly, if you've got a discounted Game Pass subscription, you won't be eligible for a code. If you do get one, make sure you use it before June 2026, as codes will start to expire from the 25th of that month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=lL8T9XdP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/forza-horizon-4-delisting-english-road.jpg?itok=0vQ4Xuif 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The idyllic British roads of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>will soon be closed off.</figcaption></figure><p>This news has prompted a huge player surge for&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>on Steam, with the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1293830/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">player count</a> at 47,741 and climbing at time of writing. Given that the game was peaking at around 7,500 players per day before the announcement, that's no mean feat.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>is currently available at a massive 80% discount on Steam is likely to be a contributing factor as well. Microsoft and Playground say more sales like this are in the offing, too, so watch out for those.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/forza-horizon-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p id="xP2s55">What would you do if you were told, with absolute certainty, that you were going to hell, and there was nothing you could do to stop it? Moreover, what would you do if <em>everyone</em> around knew this, and a bunch of big burly smoke demons were going to beat you to death before burning your corpse? Well, that’s the situation the characters in <em>Hellbound</em> find themselves in.</p>
<p id="xKbiop">Adapted from his horror-thriller webtoon, <em>Train to Busan</em> director Yeon Sang-ho’s series takes place in a modern-day South Korea that has been plunged into hysteria following a wave of mysterious murders perpetrated by supernatural beings thought to be “angels.” Believing that their victims have been condemned to hell, society has dissolved into a religious panic, with an insidious cult organization known as the New Truth Society holding sway over all forms of government and culture. </p>
<p id="UpdVd8">The series escalates from a dark fantasy police procedural about an investigator attempting to apprehend the extremist founder of the nascent New Truth Society into a nail-biting thriller about a father and mother attempting to protect their child from the machinations of the cult. <em>Hellbound</em> is a brilliantly constructed drama about the ways humans are susceptible to fanaticism and superstition, and how deliberate cooperation and compassion can stem the tide of our darkest impulses. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="QuxLcX">Bad things are coming to 1929 Berlin. <em>We</em> know this, of course — with the vantage point of history, the Weimar Republic era was marked by economic insecurity and the beginning of the Nazi Party. But the ’20s in the world of <em>Babylon Berlin</em> exist just before that horror, when the degeneracy from all that economic downturn could give way to roaring ’20s clubs just as easily as unending darkness.</p>
<p id="GTgIBz">That tension is captured in <em>Babylon Berlin</em> by two protagonists: Gereon Rath (a soft and strong Volker Bruch), a vice inspector on a secret mission to take down an extortion ring, and Charlotte Ritter (Liv Lisa Fries, all vinegar and chutzpah), the new police clerk who moonlights as a sex worker. Together they provide two very distinct vantage points on the Weimar Republic’s waning days, exposing the rot of what’s to come at the same time they find hope in what could’ve been. </p>
<p id="4lnlgZ"><em>Babylon Berlin</em>’s trick is by not getting ahead of itself. The show is perhaps one of the slower boils on this list; the thrills of the mystery, such as they are, come from meticulous pacing. Answers don’t come easy, and a whole country’s politics don’t change overnight. <em>Babylon Berlin </em>is a web of history and conspiracy, and by taking those elements equally seriously and methodically, you get a twisty, hardboiled detective story for the ages. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="VAu3QC">Solving a murder is hard enough, but how do you go about apprehending a culprit whose crime literally transcends space and time?</p>
<p id="oyeN3n"><em>Bodies</em> is a terrific cerebral whodunit with an excellent ensemble cast whose stories weave into one another effortlessly as the series builds and the mystery deepens. Created by Paul Tomalin (<em>Torchwood</em>) and based on Si Spencer’s 2014 comic, this sci-fi crime thriller follows four detectives living in different time periods of London who find themselves investigating a strange murder. What’s so strange about it? Well, the victim’s body appears — and reappears — in each time period in the exact same location. What’s even stranger is that the victim was last seen alive in 2053, despite being seen dead both in that year <em>and</em> as early as 1890.</p>
<p id="saPrdS">A engrossing drama that feels like a mashup between <em>Class of ’09</em>, <em>Dark</em>, and Alex Garland’s <em>Devs</em>, <em>Bodies</em> is one of Netflix’s most compelling releases this year and wholly deserves to be added to your watchlist. —<em>TE</em></p>

<p id="y5amzx">One of Netflix’s biggest hits from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24002689/best-netflix-original-movies-tv-shows-series-2023">its 2023 slate of shows</a> added a different (but well-trodden) sort of thriller to this list — the political thriller — following in the footsteps of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/30/16575426/house-of-cards-ending">streaming platform’s first-ever hit original show</a>.</p>
<p id="YLDwjU">A throwback to the kind of plot-heavy political thriller that used to run television (and the screwball comedies of days gone by), <em>The Diplomat</em> is a delightful star vehicle for Keri Russell. She is Kate Wyler, a whip-smart career diplomat whose plans are thrown into disarray when her upcoming assignment in Afghanistan is changed to what seems to be a cushy post as the new U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. For Kate, who loves her work and is very good at it, this is a clear downgrade, but the more power-focused people in her life (including her conniving husband Hal, played by Rufus Sewell) are delighted by the new role. What follows is a whirlwind of intrigue and mystery, with snappy dialogue, strong chemistry between the leads, and plenty of twists and turns.</p>
<p id="MrLAyQ">After courting many viewers for its first season, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23706819/diplomat-netflix-season-2-news-cast-release-date-renewal-keri-russell"><em>The Diplomat </em>will return for a second</a>. We can’t wait, especially after the first season’s cliffhanger ending. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="fE6b8f">French action cinema is having a bit of a renaissance, and one of the leading figures is director Julien Leclercq. He made the very good Olga Kurylenko thriller <em>Sentinelle</em>, the Jean-Claude Van Damme-led <em>The Bouncer</em>, and my favorite movie of his, the tense crime thriller <em>Braqueurs </em>(also known as <em>The Crew</em>).</p>
<p id="vpdsQy">Six years later, Leclercq took his talents to television with the Netflix series <em>Ganglands </em>(also known as <em>Braqueurs</em>). It shares the same name, lead (the excellent Sami Bouajila), and general vibe, but is not technically a sequel or a remake. In <em>Ganglands</em>, a crew of expert armed robbers are drawn into a gang war: They’re so dang good at crimes, everyone wants to hire them, even the people they rob.</p>
<p id="luNyjZ">Leclercq and writer Hamid Hlioua have created a muscular little thriller anchored by strong leading performances and the director’s tension-filled style of building action and conflict. The second season was recently released on Netflix, and both seasons are very much worth your time. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="297QMk">The thrill of the heist — there’s just nothing like it. Ask Assane Diop (Omar Sy). He’s been working as a con artist and thief for years, drawing his inspiration (and moniker) from an obsession with the literary gentleman thief Arsène Lupin. His thrills are hard-won, but they’re also smoothly meticulous. For Assane, the art of the heist — even with a priceless diamond necklace worn by Marie Antoinette — is a given. </p>
<p id="4O5mtC">What comes less naturally is revenge. <em>Lupin</em>’s first season follows his quest to seek vengeance on the rich family that wronged his father, and the show is full of twists and turns as his mission starts to bleed from his gentleman thief persona back into his real life. </p>
<p id="cCOyCq">The French series was a breakout hit when it premiered on Netflix, thanks in large part to Sy’s performance. He is magnetic as he makes con artistry look easy, with the sort of natural charm that makes you believe he can fake his way into any vault or safe in France (and that’s all before we get into his thieving skills and connections). With a heist, the end is, typically, self-assured. Sy’s performance ensures <em>Lupin</em> has the same confidence, and makes every step of the ride along the way its own thrill. —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="IG0rL5">David Fincher’s exacting vision is applied to the television format in one of the best shows Netflix has ever produced. Over two seasons, odd-couple FBI agents Holden Ford (Jonathan Groff) and Bill Tench (the terrific Holt McCallany) interview serial killers in the burgeoning field of criminal psychology. </p>
<p id="13Tf2y">In a nice twist on conventional character tropes, it is the young agent who is often cold and emotionally removed, and the older one who worries about the consequences of their actions. Their chemistry, as well as <em>Mindhunter</em>’s deep study of our culture around serial killers and the approach to stopping them, makes the show excellent, and it never veers into the exploitation of its peers in the genre.</p>
<p id="kSo1mJ">How exacting is Fincher’s vision? Take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di4Byf1EzRE">mind-blowing VFX reel</a> from the show, which literally changed how I watch modern cinema. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="tbEPzX">If you’re a fan of the 1960s crime drama series <em>The Fugitive</em>, you’ll likely love the 2004 anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s psychological thriller manga. After all, the series was inspired by it! Set in Germany before and after the fall of the Berlin Wall, <em>Monster</em> centers on the story of Kenzo Tenma, a Japanese brain surgeon living in Düsseldorf. After being implicated in the murders of his superiors, Kenzo must go on the run to clear his name by tracking down the real culprit: a young man he once treated. </p>
<p id="y4D2Ys">Spanning 74 episodes, <em>Monster</em> is a labyrinthine drama filled with a rich cast of characters and enough harrowing twists and revelations to fill a Matryoshka doll.<em> —TE</em></p>

<p id="voPyds">Sometimes, you want a “light brain” thriller — something not too deep that might be perfect for a bucket of popcorn or for background viewing while you fold some laundry. <em>The Night Agent </em>is Netflix’s quintessential plot-heavy popcorn thriller, elevated to solid fare thanks to the surprising chemistry between its two leads.</p>
<p id="VWXo0y">Adapted by <em>The Shield </em>creator Shawn Ryan from the novel, <em>The Night Agent </em>stars Gabriel Basso as an FBI agent who has been relegated to watching a phone that never rings in the basement in the White House. When that phone does ring one night, he and the person on the other end (Luciane Buchanan) are brought into a vast conspiracy that threatens to unravel everything he knows. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="juyg80">Luckily, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23591818/you-season-4-part-1-netflix-review"><em>You</em> is very aware</a> of this, taking the initial premise of the first season — boy meets girl, boy stalks girl, boy manipulates her whole life to a dangerous degree — and continues flipping it over, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23601157/netflix-you-season-4-part-1-2-penn-badgley">putting Joe through his paces</a>, letting him scramble to cover his ass as he gets in deeper and deeper. Each <em>You</em> season is a flavor unto itself, switching locales and ladies and letting Joe make the worst kind of case for himself. </p>
<p id="you1MP"><em>You</em> is not a show for the faint of heart, but it’s also not a thriller that rests easily on its underlying darkness. Joe may be an absolute piece of shit (<a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/27/you-season-2-finale-penn-badgley/#:~:text=He%E2%80%99s%20a%20murderer!%20He%E2%80%99s%20a%20sociopath.%20He%E2%80%99s%20abusive.%20He%E2%80%99s%20delusional.%20And%20he%E2%80%99s%20self%2Dobsessed.">even Badgley thinks so</a>, and would <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3bvqx/penn-badgley-says-the-psychopath-he-plays-in-you-potentially-exists-in-all-of-us">really like it if you did too</a>), but the show knows how to keep him engaging as it turns the screws on him. Each of the four seasons challenges him in new ways, and it makes for a snaky and startlingly good time. With <em>You</em> there’s only one thing you can always expect: for Joe to go to extreme and violent lengths to prove he’s not the bad guy. Also a plexiglass vault. —<em>ZM </em></p>

So ensuring you have the right mods could make all the difference between earning a victory royale and getting sent back to the lobby. This guide will detail everything you need to know about equipping the best mods on your car to help you win your next game.</p><h2 id="h105186"><a id=""></a>What <em>Fortnite</em> cars can I mod?</h2><p>Currently, there are only two different cars you can modify. The first is the Sports Car, which only seats two people, so if you’re playing with a third or fourth, this may not be the ideal car for you. The other car you can mod is the SUV. Unlike the Sports Car, it can seat up to four people and has more health. But it isn’t as fast as the Sports Car, and can be a bit more unwieldy to handle.<br></p><h2 id="h105187"><a id=""></a>Best car mods to use in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 5, Season 3</h2><p>The first thing you’ll want to be on the lookout for is Bulletproof Tires. These are vital to have because with all the gunshots flying around, a handful of them are bound to hit your tires, and this is the only way to ensure they don’t pop mid-fight and make it nearly impossible to control your vehicle.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-recommend-id="image://dc893894852b9d410969d364a24beffc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A car in Fortnite sporting bulletproof tires." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now that you have the Bulletproof Tires on, you’ll then want to be on the lookout for the Spiked Bumper. This is especially important because if you run over a player or crash into their car with this, it’ll inflict even more damage than it usually would.<br></p><p>Last, you’ll want to equip the Machine Gun Turret. This immediately damages cars or players the second it hits its target, unlike the Grenade Launcher Turret, which takes a few seconds to explode after shooting. What also makes the Machine Gun Turret great is that you shoot directly at other drivers or passengers in enemy cars, which could potentially down them mid-fight, rather than having to arc your shot to factor in the grenades’ trajectory.</p><h2 id="h105188"><a id=""></a><em>Fortnite </em>car tips</h2><p>It’s important to ensure your car is properly equipped during any game. But it’s also important to carry at least one repair torch in your inventory whenever you get behind the wheel. A fully charged-up Repair Torch can repair your car at least twice before it’s drained.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-recommend-id="image://152b10cbfbd959daa90bc5f2438ada5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1284" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Fortnite car sporting a spiked bumper.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is especially helpful when you find yourself in the final circles of any game, where there’s often not a lot of repair stations for your car. This will ensure it won’t explode when you find yourself in the endgame.<br></p><p>If you’re playing with more than two people, a great strategy is to have whoever’s not on the turret be on repair duties. That way you won’t have to worry about having your car explode mid-fight, and the two players up front can focus on downing enemies.</p><hr><p>That’s really all you need to know about <em>Fortnite</em>’s cars and how to make the most of them! Good luck out there. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several remakes of Resident Evil games, but for anyone looking to experience the franchise in its original low-polygon glory, the classic games are making a comeback as part of a joint effort between Capcom and GOG. Now accessible through GOG, the first Resident Evil is available to purchase and will be followed by Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis soon.</p><p>Like other GOG releases, these are all DRM-free versions of the survival-horror games, and they've been upgraded with quality-of-life improvements and enhanced compatibility for modern PCs. GOG says this version of Resident Evil is the uncut edition and contains even more blood, graphic violence, and gory scenes than the PlayStation original.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil</a> -- $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fresident_evil_3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fclassic-resident-evil-games-are-back-from-the-dead-on-pc%2F1100-6524515%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a></li></ul><p>Speaking to <a href="https://youtu.be/o38wFuD3Wag" rel="nofollow ">Suzi "SphereHunter" Hunterr</a>, GOG detailed some of the challenges in resurrecting the classic Resident Evil games.

Some of the enhancements for the games include improved DirectX rendering, new rendering options, and full support for modern controllers.</p><p>Other changes are focused on improved timing in cutscenes, better save-game managers, and the option to switch between different localizations of the games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-resident-evil-pc-re-release-spotted-could-be-out-very-soon/1100-6524343/" data-ref-id="1100-6524343">Reports of a Resident Evil re-release</a> picked up steam last week when an age rating for the game was spotted online, making this GOG version the first time Resident Evil has been available on PC digitally.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">Resident Evil Zero is reportedly one of two more remakes</a> in development, and rumors about the still-unannounced Resident Evil 9 claim that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-could-be-an-open-world-game-report/1100-6522123/" data-ref-id="1100-6522123">could be an open-world game</a>.</p>

                <p>Joe Tung, a video game industry veteran who formerly worked on the Halo and Destiny franchises, has commented on the state of video games and specifically the live-service approach. Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/former-halo-and-destiny-producer-says-live-service-model-is-much-better-for-developers-and-players-than-the-dollar60-boxed-product-model/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Tung said he believes live-service is "so much better" for both players and developers than the more-traditional-boxed product model.</p><p>Tung, who also worked at Riot Games on League of Legends and is now CEO of Supervive studio Theorycraft Games, said, "I always felt like in the $60 boxed product model that I was having to make decisions that were not in the best interest of players."</p>

<p>Instead, he said he felt that model was meant primarily to help sell as many copies as possible in the first two days. For live-service games, Tung said a strength of this model is that developers that think long-term. "You can think long-term in terms of what is best for the player, and how does that overlap with what is best for the company? I think it allows you to make much, much, much better decisions overall."</p><p>Asked about decisions made that are not necessarily in the best interests of players, Tung said back in the E3 days, some of the demos shown during press conferences may not have been representative of a final product. "It's like, let's jam as much bullshit vaporware into the build as we can in the next three months because we have to have a huge showing at E3 because it's our one opportunity to talk to our audience before we launch the game," he said.</p><p>Supervive aims to be a title that players can enjoy for 10,000 hours over the course of multiple years, Tung said. The game, which was formerly known as Project Loki, blends elements of the hero shooter, action game, and battle royale genres. Alpha testing on PC is happening now, with an open beta to follow this fall.</p>

If its first trailer,&nbsp; which was revealed by <em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cattle-country-aims-to-mix-stardew-valley-with-a-dash-of-red-dead-redemption">IGN</a> </em>today, is any indication, farming/townbuilding sim fans will want to keep an eye on the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reveal trailer gives us a great look at what to expect, which includes ranching, treasure hunting, mining, farming, and, of course, romancing. The game is coming to PC sometime in the future, but there's no release date or window in sight. Cattle Country's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2818150/Cattle_Country/?curator_clanid=40214109">Steam listing</a> simply says the release date is "to be announced."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check out the Cattle Country reveal trailer for yourself below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you might be able to hear, the Cattle Country reveal trailer is narrated by Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan, or rather, Arthur Morgan's voice actor, Roger Clark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Cattle Country straddles the saddle of cozy wholesome gaming and action-adventure," the game's Steam listing reads. "Serving up hours of the slice-of-life you'd expect on the frontier – including mining, fishing, crafting, and farming – along with deep-rooted Wild West quests delivering stories of romance, cattle drives, bandits, and robberies."</p>

<p><strong>Here are some Cattle Country screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p>
