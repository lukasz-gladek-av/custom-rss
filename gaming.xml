<p>While the Switch 1 version goes MIA</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Amazon Games and Glowmade have announced that their hack-and-slash co-op party platformer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/king_of_meat">King of Meat</a>, will be heading to Switch 2 in "<strong>early 2026</strong>".</p>
<p>This one was initially announced in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-every-nintendo-switch-game-reveal-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, and it even popped up in this year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">March Nintendo Direct</a> with a 2025 Switch 1 release window. That date wasn't meant to be, clearly, and it looks like the console might not have been either. While the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series have landed 7th October release dates, and the Switch 2 has been given a rough window, we've been told that there's no more information on a Switch 1 release for the moment. So, keep holding out hope for that one... we guess.</p>
<p>But enough pessimism — a Switch 2 release is good news! King of Meat is all about silliness, tasking you and a group of three other pals to make your way through a series of developer- and community-created dungeons in the hopes of racking up fame in front of a live studio audience.</p>
<p>There's a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fall_guys">Fall Guys</a>-esque energy to the puzzle platforming, and a decent arsenal of weapons and upgrades to make the hacky, slashy combat feel nice to pull off.</p>

<p>Amazon Games has announced that a King of Meat Technical Test will be taking place on PS5, Xbox Series and Steam from 23rd-24th August at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST / 7pm CET, to check that everything is running as it should and open the floor to player feedback. This won't be available on Switch 2, but it hopefully means that things should be in tip-top condition by the time that it comes our way.</p>
<p>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-king-of-meat-fun-and-foolish-hack-and-slash-with-a-side-of-mario-maker">hands-on</a> with the PC build of King of Meat last year and had a perfectly fun time with it — despite our worries that the Switch 1 wouldn't be able to keep up with everything happening on screen. Assuming that the Switch 2 fares a little better, this could provide some pleasant party platforming next year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-xbox-handheld-is-a-good-first-step-towards-a-windows-gaming-os.1277385/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The first thing I did when I got my hands on the Xbox Ally was reboot it. I wanted to see exactly how Microsoft manages to hide Windows beneath the Xbox interface that’s debuting on these handheld devices.</p><p>After a short startup<strong>,</strong> I was met with the standard Windows login prompt. But I could use the controller to input the PIN code, an immediate improvement over what’s available right now. And as soon as Windows 11 loaded up, the interface immediately disappeared. The Xbox PC app took over and went full-screen — and for the most part, I didn’t have to leave.</p><p>I’ve spent enough time with Microsoft and Asus’ Xbox Ally devices this week to get a better understanding of how Windows and Xbox are moving closer together. Microsoft has created what it calls an Xbox full-screen experience for these new handheld devices, which essentially takes over for Windows and hides the OS away. It’s exactly what I’ve been wanting for Windows-powered handheld gaming PCs for years now, but it still feels like a small first step in a grand next-gen Xbox plan.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Game Bar drives a lot of Microsoft’s Xbox full-screen experience.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The main interface on the Xbox Ally is similar to what can be found in the current Xbox app on Windows 11, Microsoft’s Steam competitor on PC. This app integrates with the Game Bar, Microsoft’s PC gaming overlay, to form this full-screen Xbox experience. Just like an Xbox console, you activate this Game Bar from a single tap of the Xbox button, and it’s what keeps you far away from the complexities of the Windows desktop hidden underneath.</p><p>Microsoft doesn’t load the desktop wallpaper, the taskbar, or a bunch of other processes that you don’t need for gaming. It’s essentially not loading the Explorer shell and saving around 2GB of memory by suppressing all the unnecessary parts of a typical Windows 11 installation. It’s surprisingly easy to get back to a regular Windows experience on these Xbox Ally devices, though.</p><p>You can exit out of the Xbox full-screen experience through the Game Bar or hold the Xbox button down to access the task switcher and a shortcut to the Windows desktop. Microsoft warns that you’re exiting to the Windows desktop and that you should use touch or a mouse and keyboard “for the best experience.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Xbox task switcher lets you get to the Windows desktop quickly.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Windows desktop experience is exactly the same as any regular handheld, and the Xbox team hasn’t done much additional work here to improve this side of the Xbox Ally. You’ll still have to use this part of the device to install and configure Windows apps like Discord and Steam, but once they’re up and running, you can mostly stay within the handheld-optimized confines of the Xbox full-screen experience. It’s easy to connect to Bluetooth devices or Wi-Fi networks here, and if all you’re doing is gaming, then Microsoft has nailed most of the basics, thanks to the widgets in the Game Bar.</p><p>Switching back and forth between Windows and Xbox modes is relatively quick, but after switching into the Windows desktop mode just once, you’ll need to fully reboot the device to regain the 2GB of allocated RAM. You also have the option to keep switching between both modes without those performance savings.</p><p>While the handheld-optimized Xbox UI on the Xbox Ally devices is a great improvement over what exists today, I still fear the complexity of Windows will creep through during daily use. This is still a Windows 11 device after all, which means there are OS updates and notifications from other apps or storefronts to install that might break the immersion.</p><p>For example, while the Xbox app takes over the left-hand swipe gesture to activate the Game Bar, the right-hand swipe still activates the Windows 11 notification center, which looks out of place in the Xbox UI. The Xbox team is working to improve this, but it highlights the challenges of trying to hide Windows beneath a console-like UI.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You can switch between the Xbox and Windows modes easily.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>There’s also an interesting setting that suggests you’ll be able to set something other than the Xbox app as the default boot experience on the Xbox Ally devices, potentially opening the door for Steam or other launchers to become the home app here. Microsoft wouldn’t comment on what this setting is for just yet.</p><p>Due to my limited time with the Xbox Ally devices, it’s difficult to judge just how much switching between the Windows desktop and this full-screen Xbox experience you’d have to do on a daily basis. If you install Steam, then Microsoft brings any games you install from Valve’s store into the library interface of the Xbox app, making it a launcher for these PC games and keeping you in the handheld-friendly UI. But I did play some <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> on one of the demo units on the floor and noticed the game crash, leaving me with a broken game app window instead of a more gracious home screen like you see when games crash on an Xbox Series X console.</p><p>I also ran into a UI bug switching into the Windows desktop, which Microsoft assures me will be fixed by the time these devices ship on October 16th. Asus’ own devices on the Gamescom floor also had some weird bugs, including not being able to use the Xbox button at times. There’s clearly some work needed ahead of release.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t get a chance to fully test how Windows standby and hibernation work with games on the Xbox Ally. I love the experience of turning my Xbox Series X off and then being able to immediately resume a game hours or days later, and Microsoft doesn’t have the equivalent of Quick Resume on Windows devices.</p><p>This experience feels like a first step in Microsoft’s plans for the next-gen Xbox, and seeing it in action makes it even clearer to me that Windows will be at the heart of the next Xbox console. Microsoft still has a tremendous amount of work ahead to blend all the best parts of Windows and Xbox together, but it’s about to ship some improvements that will hopefully lead to a gaming-optimized Windows operating system that spans across handhelds, consoles, and PCs.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is finally improving Windows 11’s dark mode. </strong>Nearly a decade after a full dark mode was introduced in Windows 10, the latest preview build of Windows 11 now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760466/microsoft-windows-11-dark-mode-improvements">includes even more darkened UI elements</a>. If you’re copying files or deleting them, these file operation dialogs will finally have a dark mode instead of light-themed prompt. Hopefully this signals that more dark mode improvements are coming with the 25H2 update to Windows 11 later this year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft employee arrested at headquarters while protesting Israel contracts. </strong>Microsoft employee <strong>Anna Hattle</strong>, a software engineer in Microsoft’s cloud and AI team, has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763261/microsoft-employee-arrested-headquarters-protest-redmond-police">arrested at the company’s headquarters during protests</a> against Microsoft’s cloud contracts with Israel. Hattle’s arrest was part of 18 arrests by Redmond Police, including former Microsoft employees who joined the protest for a second day. The No Azure for Apartheid group continues to protest Microsoft’s cloud contracts with Israel, calling on the company to cut ties after reports emerged that the Israeli government uses Azure to power a surveillance network of Palestinian phone calls.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft hints at “more affordable” Xbox Cloud Gaming plan</strong>. Microsoft has dropped hints about a potential dedicated Xbox Cloud Gaming plan multiple times before, but it feels like we’re getting closer to an announcement. <strong>Jason Ronald</strong>, Microsoft’s VP of Next Generation, appeared on the company’s official Xbox podcast earlier this week and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760813/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-new-price-plan-hint">hinted that Microsoft wants to make its Xbox Cloud</a> “much more affordable” and accessible to players. Microsoft is currently building a next-generation Xbox console and cloud network, so not having to buy Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just for cloud gaming access would certainly be a welcome move.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Excel adds Copilot AI to help fill in spreadsheet cells. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761338/microsoft-excel-ai-copilot-spreadsheet-cell-filling">AI-powered function in Excel</a> that can automatically fill cells in spreadsheets. It’s similar to the feature that Google Sheets rolled out in June, and allows you to call up a “COPILOT” function to generate summaries, create tables, and more.</span></li><li><span><strong><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></strong><strong> is heading to Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. I’ve been patiently waiting for Microsoft’s first Switch 2 game, and at Gamescom this week, the company announced that it’s bringing Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761722/a-new-indy-game-for-switch-2"><em>Indiana Jones</em> to Nintendo’s latest console in 2026</a>. It’s one of the first PC games to require ray tracing, so it’ll be interesting to see what Bethesda does with the Switch 2 port.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11 test brings AI file search to the Copilot app</strong>. Microsoft has started testing the ability to use AI to search through your files and images directly from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762788/windows-11-test-brings-ai-file-search-to-the-copilot-app">Copilot app on Windows 11</a>. The test is rolling out to Windows Insiders on Copilot Plus PCs and allows you to use more descriptive language when conducting your search. Microsoft is also making it easier to jump into “guided help” sessions with Copilot Vision.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Teams is getting a microphone volume indicator</strong>. I can’t be the only person who asks “Can you hear me?” on a Microsoft Teams meeting, but that might be a thing of the past soon. Microsoft is adding a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/Microsoft365InsiderBlog/new-microphone-volume-indicator-in-teams/4442879">volume indicator to Teams</a> on macOS and Windows that makes it easy to see if your microphone is working. This new feature is currently in testing before it rolls out to Teams users in the coming months.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s AI chief wants to “build AI for people, not to be a person</strong>.” Microsoft AI CEO <strong>Mustafa Suleyman</strong> has <a href="https://mustafa-suleyman.ai/seemingly-conscious-ai-is-coming">written a blog post</a> where he shares his concerns about AI models becoming too humanlike to the point where people will believe they are conscious entities. “My central worry is that many people will start to believe in the illusion of AIs as conscious entities so strongly that they’ll soon advocate for AI rights, model welfare and even AI citizenship,” says Suleyman. “This development will be a dangerous turn in AI progress and deserves our immediate attention.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ new Xbox Ally handhelds launch on October 16th. </strong>We finally got a date for the new Xbox Ally handhelds this week: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762116/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-compatibility">October 16th</a>. Weirdly there was no price or preorders, though. That didn’t stop Best Buy from accidentally listing the Xbox Ally at $549.99 and the Xbox Ally X at $899.99. I do wonder if Asus and Microsoft can subsidize this hardware a little further to bring those price points down, and we’re going to find out if that’s possible in the coming weeks.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox on PC is getting a highlights reel and Auto SR</strong>. Alongside the Xbox Ally release date announcement, Microsoft also revealed this week that it’s bringing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166413/microsoft-windows-auto-super-resolution-sr-qualcomm-npu-dlss-fsr">Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR)</a>, which uses an NPU to upscale games, to the Xbox Ally X in early 2026. It will be joined by a new highlights reels feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay moments and make them easily shareable with friends or on social networks.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is improving the game shader experience on Windows.</strong> The DirectX team at Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/">new “advanced shader delivery” system</a> that’s designed to preload game shaders during download on the Xbox Ally devices. It’s launching on these handhelds first, to make games launch faster and run a lot smoother without stutters. It’s similar to Valve’s own efforts to improve the shader situation, and Microsoft says it will eventually expand this to more games and more devices over time.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a7c9c8d3c2d7c6c3e7d3cfc2d1c2d5c0c289c4c8ca"><span data-cfemail="5c323328392c3d381c2834392a392e3b39723f3331">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <title><![CDATA[Why Hollow Knight: Silksong Took So Long To Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release.1277376/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally releasing on September 4, 2025. That may be two years after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was originally promised</a> for release, but the news doesn’t come with any less hype surrounding it.</p>



<p>But why did it take so long for Silksong, the sequel to the highly successful Hollow Knight, to release? According to Team Cherry, it’s because they were having too much fun building the game.</p>



<p>In a new feature story from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a>, Team Cherry Co-Founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen spoke about what it was like creating the game, the delays, the pending release, and more.</p>



<p>The lengthy gap between Hollow Knight and Silksong wasn’t the result of any sort of studio struggles. Instead, the project grew far larger than originally planned. What began as a small expansion centered on Hornet evolved into a full-scale sequel with multiple towns, a deep quest system, and a world even bigger than the original.</p>



<p>Team Cherry’s small size meant progress naturally took longer, but the developers say the process was consistently joyful. Their creative workflow encouraged them to experiment and add new ideas, which kept expanding the scope of the game.</p>



<p><strong>“We’re very fortunate that we have a development method that is so enjoyable,</strong>” Gibson told Schreier. “<strong>Not exactly sure how we stumbled into that. Everything comes together quickly. You can see results fast. Ideas turn into something that exist in the game almost immediately before your eyes, and that’s very satisfying. And that allows you to go off on those tangents and meet weird characters because someone’s off-handedly mentioned a weird character as an idea and the other person’s laughed, and that’s enough.</strong>“</p>



<p>Unlike many studios, Team Cherry wasn’t pressured to rush out a release. Hollow Knight’s massive success—over 15 million copies sold—provided financial freedom, allowing them to polish Silksong extensively and ensure the entire game met the same high standard.</p>



<p>After releasing regular updates, the studio went quiet to focus on the game, believing regular updates would only frustrate fans. The end result is the game they wanted to make, even if it took years longer than expected.</p>



<p>Now, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming in September. However, that’s not the end for the game. Both Gibson and Pellen say they already are working on plans for what’s next for the game.</p>



<p><strong>“Launching it is obviously quite exciting,”</strong> Pellen said. <strong>“What comes after for us is equally as exciting.”</strong></p>



<p>In his hands-on preview of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Andy Highton said</a> that Silksong is “the game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait.”</p>

This means that players always know exactly what they are buying and how much it costs.</li></ul><p><strong>Game Content</strong></p><p>There will be over 100 dungeons available at launch, but that number will quickly grow as the community pushes Create Mode to its limits. Most launch dungeons were meticulously crafted by Glowmade, while some came straight from the next generation of dungeon creators like you. These community-built dungeons were hand-picked from our ongoing playtests.</p><p><strong>Future Updates</strong></p><p><em>King of Meat</em> updates to the base game will be free for all players who’ve bought the game. While we aren’t ready to talk about post-launch support just yet, you can look forward to new game modes, player customisation options, Create Mode tools, regular events, dungeons, and more.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/king-of-meat-launches-october-7-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-pc-in-early-2026-for-switch]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Forza Horizon 6 hasn't even been officially announced by Microsoft, and yet, a possible leak might have revealed the racing game's setting: Japan. An Australian car import company reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/a/s8U6ckB" rel="nofollow ">posted and then deleted an image</a> on Instagram that showed a developer scanning Japanese kei cars.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://cultandclassic.com.au/" rel="nofollow ">Cult and Classic</a> post was spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mvq1t0/australian_car_import_company_cult_classic_may/" rel="nofollow ">the subreddit Gaming Leaks and Rumours</a>, with Forza Horizon fans extrapolating that the Japanese kei cars (which aren't found in America) strongly hint at Japan for the game's setting. However, there are a couple of reasons this theory could be misguided. For instance, Forza Horizon developer Playground Games is based in the United Kingdom, so cars not being available in the US has no bearing on scanning for the team. Additionally, why wouldn't the dev member just fly out to Japan instead of Australia to scan a kei car, which roughly translates to light vehicle?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s whopping open beta has now come and gone, and Battlefield Studios is addressing the feedback it has received, chiefly as it pertains to the game's bigger maps and criticism of player counts across its modes.</p><p>One of the main concerns for players coming out of the beta was the status of Battlefield 6's larger maps. The biggest one in the beta, Liberation Peak, was popular enough with players who craved the classic large-scale warfare of the series--even if it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">far too many snipers</a>--but many were left wanting more. This feeling was only exacerbated by the beta's apparent focus on smaller maps and modes, like Breakthrough and Rush on infantry-focused arenas like Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, and eventually, Empire State.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1958544678409642329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> to players starved for bigger maps, which have already been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/much-larger-battlefield-6-maps-revealed-in-datamine-including-new-vehicles/1100-6534039/" data-ref-id="1100-6534039">revealed by dataminers</a>, Battlefield Studios has assured the community that "larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package," and they're on the way. The post elaborates that two of the game's significantly larger maps, one set in Mirak Valley and the other a remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm, will be included in the next phase of Battlefield Labs testing, which is set to continue leading up to Battlefield 6's launch on October 10.</p><p>Fans of Battlefield have come to expect certain things of the games, and one of those core tenets is greater player counts than the average multiplayer FPS title. However, a great deal of these players were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">let down</a> when the fan-favorite mode Rush was introduced in the second weekend of the beta with a significantly smaller lobby size than usual, supporting up to 24 players in tight 12v12 matches.</p><p>Rush typically tasks teams with defending and attacking pairs of bomb sites at a time and has supported bigger lobbies in past games, which is what has wrinkled fans of the mode about its implementation in the latest game. It and the 64-player Conquest modes are often looked to as the signature modes of the Battlefield series and emblematic of its emphasis on big battles, so any significant change to it was bound to cause a stir. Battlefield Studios hears the concern from players, but also thinks that this downsizing might be the best move for Rush right now, and that it is in line with what it calls "the golden era" of the mode.</p><p>The team shared, "When it comes to Rush, the conversation we observed wasn't just about player count, but also about how maps play, and the tactical experience they offer. Rush is a mode with deep roots, originally known as Gold Rush in [Battlefield] Bad Company, where matches typically ranged from 12v12 to 16v16 players. Many of you remember this as the golden era of Rush, and it continues to inspire our approach today."</p><p>It then goes on to say that despite toying with bigger lobby sizes in the past, these inflated player counts often led to issues that are streamlined or eliminated outright by cutting back and emphasizing smaller-team tactics. Due to that, the team is sticking with its lowered default player count for Rush, but encourages players wanting large-scale Rush to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-portal-mode-is-the-answer-to-people-not-wanting-a-game-they-can-complete/1100-6533700/" data-ref-id="1100-6533700">Portal</a>, Battlefield's custom matchmaking and level-building mode.</p><p>Elsewhere, the post goes into more detail about overall beta numbers. As folks may have gathered from the queues, livestreams, videos, and posts on social media, Battlefield 6's open beta was a knockout for EA. According to a graphic released by the team, there were roughly 420 million matches played over the course of the two beta weekends, totaling about 92 million hours of play. Players racked up more than 4.9 billion kills, knocked nearly 4 million jets out of the sky (I was at least half a dozen of those), and did 196 billion dollars in property damage.</p><p>Battlefield 6 releases on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Digital Eclipse has revealed the full roster of games for its retrospective compilation/interactive documentary, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection. This update reveals that the infamously terrible single-player spin-off titles Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces will be part of the bundle.</p><p>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero launched for the original PlayStation in 1997 and is a side-scrolling action game starring the titular ice ninja (specifically Bi-Han, the first Sub-Zero and eventual Noob Saibot). Spoiler: It’s a very bad game, but it is notable for featuring the series debuts for staple fighters Quan Chi and Shinnok. You can watch former GI editors (including <em>Giant Bomb'</em>s Dan Ryckert) suffer through this game in this classic 2010 episode of Replay, posted below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFljLP_1-4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_wFljLP_1-4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces was released in 2000, also for PlayStation 1, and is a 3D action game starring Jax. The game sees him taking on Kano and his crew of baddies, including the debuting Tremor, who would later resurface as a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/07/19/see-mortal-kombat-x-39-s-next-dlc-character-tremor-crush-opponents-with-rocks.aspx">DLC fighter in Mortal Kombat X</a>. Special Forces didn’t exactly light the world on fire; that’s a nice way of saying it’s also terrible. It does have a very funny and strange <a href="https://youtu.be/8T1EeAHIFMU?si=kn0qWzQKEWURaO4H">‘70s spy-themed intro cinematic</a> going for it, though.</p><p>Digital Eclipse also announced that the extremely rare WaveNet Arcade version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is part of the Kollection. This version was originally made to support Midway’s WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcades, and has not been available on any platform since 1997. It’s also the only arcade release to feature Noob Saibot as a playable fighter.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the Kollection's new trailer from Gamescom below.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Here is the full list of titles in the Kollection:</p><ul><li><strong>Mortal Kombat</strong> – 1992 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat II</strong> – 1993 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat 3</strong> – 1995 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis)</li><li><strong>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</strong> – 1995 (Arcade, WaveNet Arcade, SNES)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Trilogy</strong> – 1996 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat 4</strong> – 1997 (Arcade)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</strong> – 1997 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Special Forces</strong> – 2000 (PlayStation)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat Advance</strong> – 2001 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance</strong> – 2002 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li><strong>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition</strong> – 2003 (Game Boy Advance)</li></ul><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection launches later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/21/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-full-roster-includes-mythologies-sub-zero-and-special]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apparently-the-silksong-devs-were-just-being-normal-about-it.1277349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> got a trailer and release date today, meaning huge swathes of the internet are now going to need to find a new <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126470/hollow-knight-silksong-meme-release-date-triple-i/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme</a>. What took so long? Developer Team Cherry was just making a video game.</p><p>According to a story by Jason Schreier at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the big mystery of what’s been up with <em>Silksong</em> since its announcement in 2019 was just studio co-founders William Pellen and Ari Gibson taking their time making their video game. “It’s just the case that we’re a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn’t any big controversial moment behind it,” Gibson said.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hollow Knight: Silksong - Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XGeJwsUP9c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>According to the developers, <em>Silksong</em>, initially meant to be an expansion, grew big enough to be a full game, and then the team kept adding new ideas. According to Gibson, the studio eventually went radio silent because “[w]e felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game,” Pellen said.</p><p>Sounds right! The studio told Bloomberg they did believe the game would be out sooner, and that, according to Gibson “we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things.” But Gibson also said that, rather than being stressful, the actual <em>development</em> part of developing a game was fun, so the studio wanted to keep doing it. He said, “[I]t’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p><p>My two favorite parts of this story are that the team doesn’t use Jira, a project management software ubiquitous in games and tech (they briefly had Trello, but their account got deactivated because they didn’t use it enough) and that they were mostly ignorant of the online drama around the game. According to Bloomberg, “They say they never read comments on YouTube or Reddit, although occasionally friends or family would send them some of the funniest ones.” Pellen told Bloomberg that it “[f]eels like we’re going to ruin [fans’] fun by releasing the game.”</p><p>My second favorite part is that after the hints about the game during a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/23160254/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June Xbox showcase</a> and a tease during Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnH9UcLZpbM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night</a>, neither Microsoft nor Geoff Keighley got the big trailer and release date everyone has spent years thirsting for. Team Cherry just put it all up on their YouTube page at what was for me on the East Coast a totally normal time (though after maybe <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shepardcdr.bsky.social/post/3lww5sv6s722u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bit too much countdown</a>). In an industry defined by hype and desperately trying to force the big moments of the past into a space they <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no longer fit in</a>, one of the most hotly-anticipated games said “no” to all that and just did its own thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I won’t go so far as to call this some wider lesson for all game developers; as Bloomberg points out, it certainly helps that the original <em>Hollow Knight </em>made enough money to support a small team taking as long as it wanted to make not just a game, but a sequel to a wildly popular one that people are still playing. And however much the developers claim they didn’t pay attention to the hype and anticipation, the wait and its silence certainly generated buzz that kept both the original (Bloomberg writes that <em>Hollow Knight</em> has sold an additional 12 million copies since <em>Silksong</em>’s 2019 announcement) and <em>Silksong</em> in people’s consciousness, and which it seems reasonable to imagine will have an effect on <em>Silksong</em>’s ultimate sales.&nbsp;</p><p>And I don’t think this is some look-in-the-mirror moment for the folks who spammed “Silksong” at every showcase since 2019 either. As the devs themselves acknowledged, what Gibson called the “strange or very exciting communities” that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jubilation-chaos-and-a-lot-of-screaming-inside-the-hollow-knight-community-discord-as-the-silksong-release-date-finally-hit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formed around <em>not</em> seeing <em>Silksong</em></a><em> </em>were fun in their own right, and certainly gave folks something to rally around as we sat through events over the years. Since this is the internet, I’m sure there were some toxic corners earnestly angered over the wait, and plenty of editors demanding <em>Silksong</em> prewrites tailored to whatever the Google search requirements of the moment were. But from where I sat, <em>Silksong</em> was a funny joke my friends made that offset the dread of covering another showcase for work, a low stakes space to play with anticipation and disappointment in a field that often makes too much out of them.</p><p>Of course, that’s all over now: I’m already seeing journalist peers fishing for homes for reviews, worrying over how long they’ll have between code and embargo <strong>(Update, 12:55pm--</strong>According to Schreier, Team Cherry <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't plan to send out early code</a><strong>)</strong>, and stressing about how many other games are releasing near <em>Silksong</em>’s September 4 release date. But, at least for a little while, some fans got to have their jokes, and some developers got to make their video game.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bioshock-4-rod-fergusson-cloud-chamber-layoffs-2k-games"><h3>History Doesn’t Repeat, But It Often Rhymes</h3></a><p>There’s always a lighthouse, there’s always a man (Rod Fergusson), there’s always a city</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cff408fab2636/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>Team Cherry has finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">release date</a>. It's <strong>4th September</strong>, if you missed it, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier has sat down with the devs to find out why it has taken so long to make.</p>
<p>The short answer, as detailed in Schreier's feature (paywalled), is that the team has simply been having a nice time making it. The ideas kept piling up, and a pesky little global pandemic pushed things back somewhat, but it sounds like Team Cherry has been maintaining a healthy attitude to the whole thing for the past seven years — which, in the grand scheme of high-profile development stories, is rather lovely to hear.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067muiyon&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Despite spending this much time with the massively-hyped sequel, it seems that Team Cherry already has ideas for <em>more</em> content to add to the game. "Launching it is obviously quite exciting," the studio's co-founder William Pellen told Bloomberg, “What comes after for us is equally as exciting”.</p>
<p>"The most interesting thing now is what we can add to it next," Team Cherry's other co-founder, Ari Gibson, agreed, even teasing that the team has "got a plan" for what these additions might look like. "Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well," Gibson continued, "but hopefully we can achieve some of it”.</p>

<p>And it sounds like the team could have kept going for many more years than the six it's been since Silksong was announced. "It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping," Pellen commented, "We could have kept going”. Gibson even stated that he "had to stop sketching" at some point, to avoid a situation where that game takes "15 years to finish". Heh, it makes six years of waiting sound like child's play, no?</p>
<p>The devs also shared with Bloomberg why their updates have been so few and far between in recent years, with Gibson stating that “We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing, because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it’”. Pellen sang to the same tune, affirming, “Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game” — not that they expected things to take this long, of course.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make">Bloomberg feature</a> is full of other details about the game's development besides those mentioned above, and is well worth a read if, like us, you've been wondering what's been happening over at Team Cherry in recent years.</p>
<p>There are just two weeks to go now until we all finally get our hands on Hollow Knight: Silksong, and based on our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/video-at-last-weve-played-hollow-knight-silksong-on-switch-2">Gamescom hands-on preview</a>, it's looking extremely promising.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-interactive-entertainment-sells-its-stake-in-evo-to-nodwin-gaming-sie-to-sponsor-the-event-through-2028.1277316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has sold its ownership stake in the fighting tournament EVO to NODWIN Gaming, a company that's also backed by the Sony Group Corporation, but owned by Nazara Technologies. SIE will continue to sponsor the event globally through to 2028, while NODWIN Gaming will take over co-ownership duties alongside RTS.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2025-business-update">"<em>Business Update</em>"</a> blog post on the official EVO website, where the Evolution Championship Series called the change "<em>a major step forward"</em> for the tournament. </p>



<p>On the transition, SIE senior vice president and head of global partner development and relations, Phil Rosenberg, said, "<em>When SIE acquired Evo alongside RTS in 2021, our goal was to help the Evo community grow and spotlight the skills and passion of fighting game fans on a global stage</em>. <em>As SIE transitions to become an Evo sponsor, the momentum for Evo has never been stronger, following a successful Las Vegas event and upcoming expansion to new regions. We look forward to supporting the continued growth of Evo globally."</em></p>



<p>For NODWIN Gaming's part, co-founder and managing director Akshat Rathee added, "<em>Evo was built by a team whose authenticity and passion for the fighting game community are unmatched</em>. <em>We will continue SIE’s great work and honor the legacy of everyone who has made it what it is today, while opening the door for a new generation to experience the spirit of Evo</em>."</p>



<p>Today's update also included the introduction of a new partner, Qiddiya, which is now a global partner of the tournament and an investor in its co-owner, RTS.</p>



<p>While Sony Interactive Entertainment is no longer a part owner of the tournament, as a global sponsor we can still expect to see SIE and PlayStation use the tournament to showcase upcoming products like the recently unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a> fight stick and playable demos of upcoming fighting games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls,</a> which attendees at this year's show had the chance to try. </p>

                <p>Digital Eclipse has officially confirmed two more games for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection/">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, as the infamous PlayStation-era spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat Special Forces are being added to the compilation. These titles have been unavailable for decades on PC and newer consoles, and Digital Eclipse added that they're being enhanced alongside the other Mortal Kombat games in the roster.</p><p>The studio says that there will be a rewind feature to make gameplay more forgiving, on-screen move lists, and a Trainer Mode to help players learn various combos and fatalities. Players can also expect reduced load times in each game.</p><p>The other big reveal from the studio was that the WaveNet edition of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 will also be included in the collection. This was originally developed to support Midway's ambitious WaveNet online matchmaking service for arcade machines, and it was the only Mortal Kombat arcade game to feature Noob Saibot as a playable character.</p><p>If you want an idea of just how big of a deal it is to have this version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 included, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/osu16bit.bsky.social/post/3lwwbjk72w22d" rel="nofollow ">NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback has a detailed thread</a> on just how ahead of its time the technology was, the significant gameplay changes that were made for this edition, and how this version of the game was thought to be lost to time before a working arcade cabinet was found.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89KZUGXbqY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you never played Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero or Mortal Kombat Special Forces, then you missed out on two <em>interesting </em>games. Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero was released in 1997, and it was a sidescrolling action game that still retained the combat from the 2D Mortal Kombat games. A sound idea in theory, but in practice, the unforgiving platform sections and brutally difficult traps-- combined with sluggish controls--made it a chore to play. If you could look past those flaws, the game did have an interesting skill-tree system and live-action cinematics that rivaled the 1995 film in the cheese department.</p><p>Mortal Kombat: Special Forces hit the scene in 2000, and it had a rocky development. Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias and several other staff members left Midway before the game was finished, leading to content being cut and plans for Sonya Blade to feature as a playable character to be scrapped. The game isn't fondly remembered, but it's still an interesting part of Mortal Kombat history that Digital Eclipse is preserving for a new generation of players.</p><p>If you're looking to grab it, you can p<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-preorder-guide/1100-6533623/" data-ref-id="1100-6533623">reorder the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection right now</a>. With those two entries confirmed, the full list of playable games includes:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat -- 1992 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 2 -- 1993 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, SNES, Genesis)</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 -- 1995 (Arcade, WaveNet Arcade, SNES)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Trilogy -- 1996 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 -- 1997 (Arcade)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero -- 1997 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Special Forces -- 2000 (PlayStation)</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance -- 2001 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance -- 2002 (Game Boy Advance)</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition -- 2003 (Game Boy Advance)</li></ul><p>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection launches on December 12 for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch 2, and Switch.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-battlefield-6-open-beta-drew-the-most-players-for-a-beta-in-battlefield%E2%80%99s-history-with-over-420m-matches-played-across-92m-hours.1277262/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Now that we're a few days removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6 Open Beta</a>, EA and its Battlefield Studios have had a chance to look at the results, which, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">based on the player counts we saw during the beta</a>, are unsurprisingly staggering. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-open-beta-debrief">According to EA</a>, the beta for Battlefield 6 drew in the most players for a beta in the series' history, with 420,127,450 matches played across 92,351,578 hours of gameplay.</p>



<p>The beta also contained more content than any previous beta in the series' history, with multiple modes across four maps available for players to check out. 32% of all players deployed with the Assault class, 26% jumped in as Support, 23% as Engineer, and only 19% of players deployed with the Recon class.</p>



<p>Also, those 23% of players who were running Support were able to rack up 7,453,121 kills with defibrillators.</p>

<p>But EA is doing more than just tallying up statistics when looking back on the beta. It's also analyzing how players behaved during it, and taking in feedback given on the state of the game. As a result, a number of tweaks and adjustments are being made to multiple aspects of the game for its coming launch on October 10, 2025.</p>



<p>Starting with the maps, the collective teams at Battlefield Studios quickly noticed that players were taking advantage of flanking tactics that involved running out of bounds and quickly back into the fight, but behind enemy lines for a few easy kills. If you were one of the players who did this, hopefully you've had your fun, since EA is "<em>actively working on adjustments to prevent unintended access and ensure gameplay stays within the intended boundaries</em>."</p>



<p>Also, if you were concerned that the maps in the beta were too small, EA is reassuring that "<em>more fast-paced maps, larger-scale maps are already part of our launch package.</em>" It continues to say that for all players currently in its Battlefield Labs program, two new multiplayer maps will be tested soon in the lead up to October.</p>



<p>In terms of the weapons, while the beta didn't include the full range of the arsenal that will be available in Battlefield 6 at launch, Battlefield Studios is "<em>making targeted adjustments to deliver a more consistent and rewarding gunplay experience</em>," including tweaking recoil and tap-fire characteristics for all weapons, and the beast that was the M87A1 shotgun is no more, since it will require more than one-shot to get a kill moving forward.</p>



<p>Player movement is also getting reworked, with a reduction in horizontal speed and a greater penalty added for consecutive jumps. Accuracy has also been decreased while jumping and sliding, in order to "<em>make sliding and jumping more situational, so they are no longer ideal options for engaging in gunfights</em>."</p>



<p>Lastly, EA is taking a pass at player counts, especially in Rush mode, and playlist options, and in each section stresses that "<em>finding the right balance is an ongoing process</em>."</p>



<p>As far as next steps are concerned, the first players to see those will be the ones in the Battlefield Labs program, as EA is introducing "<em>in-game adjustments</em>" for upcoming events. Everyone else will have to wait until Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 10, 2025 to see what's changed since the beta.</p>

              <p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> is a very unlikely subject for one of the best games of the turn of the millennium. And yet, that game exists! <em>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</em> was one of the best FPS games of its generation! Heck, <em>Elite Force II&nbsp;</em>was pretty damned good, too, and there was almost a Looking Glass game based on the franchise in the mid-90s! Clearly German publisher Daedalic is hoping to capture a little of the same magic with its announcement of <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em>, a “story-based survival strategy game” set on board the spaceship lost on the other side of the galaxy.</p> <p>With some very hefty&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>&nbsp;vibes, <em>Star Trek Voyager: </em><em>Across the Unknown</em> (<em>VATU</em>) is played on a sublimely lovely cutaway view of the side of Voyager, presented as if on a&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> display screen. We’ll be captaining the ship as it explores “12 vast sectors” of the Delta Quadrant, the farthest point in the galaxy from our own Alpha territory. This involves managing the ship’s systems and crew, doing all that good&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> diplomacy, and facing a bunch of moral decisions that will apparently shape how you experience your run through the game. And yes, run through, because this is intended to be replayed,&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>-style, with the ship rearranging its layout and apparently even being “re-imagined” based on the path you take through the quadrant.</p> <p>The trailer, which mostly features lovely images of the USS Voyager swishing and swooping around in space, gives an incredibly brief glimpse of the game itself, which seems a bit of an odd shame given how lovely it looks when you see it. Also, note that somehow Daedalic doesn’t seem to have been able to license the original theme tune, which is very odd.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-0brgSYDEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>So why&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>? For those who failed to become stranded in the Delta Quadrant in 1995, this was the third ’90s <em>Trek</em> series, starting when&nbsp;<em>The Next Generation</em> had come to an end, and midway through the run of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. However, it quickly separated itself (mostly) from the overlapping storylines of those shows by having the fancy new ship leave DS9 to head to the Badlands to investigate the naughty actions of Starfleet rebels, the Marquis. Except, when it gets to them it gets attacked by some wobbly space wave and finds the remains of its crew, and the remains of the Marquis members, flung across the galaxy to completely uncharted space. The two opposing halves have to form a functioning crew and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> cartoon-style, endlessly try to find their way home.</p> <p>Given that the adventures all took place far from Starfleet and thus Voyager was unable to be aided by other friendly ships in the faction, it does make sense to use the show for your <em>FTL</em>-like. On the other hand, though, you’re limiting your audience to people who remember a 30-year-old TV show. Yes, I know <em>you</em> remember it, and you’re thinking, “How can anyone not remember&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>?! It had Seven of Nine in it!” But let me assure you that nearly everyone born in the last 30 years is wondering why you’re shouting out numbers with that creepy look in your eyes. “This game isn’t about nostalgia,” says the game’s director at developer gameXcite (that’s the one time I’ll capitalize their studio name as they want us to), in a press release promoting the game based on the decades-old license loved by nerds in their 40s and 50s. “It’s about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619163">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>Which then does rather raise the next big oddity. Gives us the conn? But shouldn’t Captain Janeway have the conn? The descriptions of the game that have appeared so far seem very ambiguous about this, especially as it does seem to be using the original crew as characters.</p>

 <p>The big selling point here are some very grand promises to let you rewrite the story of <em>Voyager</em> quite significantly. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">game’s description on Steam</a> suggests it’ll be granting all manner of “what if?” scenarios, including the consequences of Voyager adding Borg technology to its systems as it attempts to recover from the initial disaster. “Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently?” asks the blurb. “If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the <i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?” Uh, no, but I can if you want.</p> <blockquote><p>“Wonder no more: <i>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</i>&nbsp;allows players to take control and shape the journey of the&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.”</p></blockquote> <p>There are also promises of ship-to-ship combat and away missions, although again it’s not yet entirely clear whether the latter will be under your direct control, or play out as an off-screen event whose outcome is based on the team you selected and the orders you gave. Combat, however, is a bit clearer. “From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry,” we’re told. “And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619164">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>This all sounds very ambitious, and I’ve certainly been burned&nbsp;<em>far&nbsp;</em>too many times by games that promise wish-fulfillment variety when what they really mean is a different icon appears on the screen. I’m also a smidge concerned that the team behind it have previously only made a trio of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix"><em>Asterix</em></a>-themed products, making this a big step forward. Still, the early footage looks incredible.</p> <p>Right, so what “what if?” scenarios would I like to see for <em>Voyager</em>? I want to do a run where we continue Janeway and Paris’s post-evolution relationship as lizards, where we see them raise their young together and learn how this form is superior to their paltry pre-warp-10 human incarnations. I want one where the crew never brings on Seven of Nine and so people remember <em>Voyager</em> for anything other than there being a pretty robot lady with big boobs. And I want to do one where, on the first encountering of Q, they just tell him to stop fucking around and send them home, and he agrees, and that’s that.</p> <p>There’s no release date yet, but hopefully we’ll soon get some footage of the game actually being played.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was easily one of the biggest reveals for Gamescom 2025. Fortunately, Insider Gaming had the chance to try the preview build of the upcoming LEGO Batman game at the event, and here are our early impressions on the preview build.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight took the audience by storm at Opening Night Live, showcasing the Caped Crusader in a brand-new light, featuring iconic moments from his cinematic and comic universes while adding the beloved LEGO touch.&nbsp;It features a vast, open-world Gotham City and a narrative experience that begins with Batman’s origins and culminates in his transformation into a living legend. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-arkham-but-in-lego">It’s Arkham, But in LEGO</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The preview build at Gamescom allowed players to take on the roles of Batman and Commissioner Gordon as they worked together to take down crime and explore Gotham City. Both characters were unique in their functional abilities, with Batman more attuned to hand-to-hand combat, whereas Gordon focused on ranged attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both combat and movement styles are unique for the characters, each having two side abilities to choose from: Batman has a batarang that can stun enemies and the batclaw, which can grapple enemies. Gordon, on the other hand, has two types of guns: one that shoots pellets and the other that glues the enemy into a mold.&nbsp;The game also features a variety of gadgets that aid in puzzle solving; however, we have yet to see them in action. </p>



<p>The combat takes huge inspiration from the Arkham games, featuring various types of unique takedowns, stealth mechanics, and even a dodge ability that lets you vault over your enemies. Vast hordes of enemies will surround players during most situations, and they are spread across the city, breaking all kinds of laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even for a preview build, gameplay feels solid, and the developers have done a great job in finalizing the combat and traversal mechanics, allowing you to really get into the shoes of Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://legobatmangame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> has also successfully captured the essence of Gotham City. The dark and gritty vibe is on point. Moreover, there are various ways to traverse the city, including batmobiles, gliding, batclaws, and more. Just like the Arkham games, players can perch over rooftops, use the focus bar to build momentum, and transition straight into a glide to explore the city from the heights.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The world itself is pretty extensive, not only featuring iconic locations that you may remember from the comics and the movies, but also featuring a plethora of puzzles spread across the city. Players have a lot to do in the game even when they aren’t playing the story mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-final-thoughts">Final Thoughts </h2>



<p>Overall, my early impressions of the game are that the developers are doing many things the right way. The gameplay and exploration are on point, and I was left wanting more as soon as my time was up. Now all we need to see is how TT games approach the story, different levels, and characters for the final build. However, given their current situation, it seems highly promising and has massive potential.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When you first boot up Okomotive's latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">Herdling</a>, it may seem like the mystical vistas you encounter are something out of fantasy. But that’s not the case. The development team drew inspiration from hikes they took while creating the game.</p><p dir="ltr">“We went on a few hikes in the Swiss mountains, before and while developing Herdling," Herdling creative director Don Schmocker tells GameSpot via email. "From Medels to the Suretta Lakes, three picturesque mountain lakes located close to the Swiss and Italian border, or up one of the better-known Swiss mountains, Mount Rigi. They were always inspiring and got us away from our computers for a bit."</p><p dir="ltr">Hikes along the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/grisons/splugen-surettaseen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Suretta Lakes</a> and up <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/lucerne/rigi-panorama-trail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mount Rigi</a> inspired Herdling, a magical adventure where players guide strange, mythical creatures across magical mountain landscapes. The team’s goal was to capture the feeling of wandering and exploring while herding--and to make it feel natural rather than mechanical.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553984"></a><figcaption>The mountains may be the most realistic element of Herdling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4553984-herdling-screenshot-03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">“When we decided to develop Herdling, we were intrigued by the fantasy of guiding strange animals through the mountains,” Schmocker added. “But we knew that the first thing we had to figure out was the original herding gameplay. We built several prototypes to try out different approaches. Some were more direct but felt too mechanical, and some were too unintuitive. Another problem we needed to solve was making the animals feel natural and animal-like, without interfering with players’ intentions.”</p><p dir="ltr">Okomotive eventually found a gameplay style that felt fluid and intuitive. To keep movement smooth, the team looked to games like The Pathless, Journey, and even racing games like SSX--making sure herding never felt like an escort mission or a puzzle.</p><p dir="ltr">The game’s visuals also mix fantastical and real-world influences. The Calicorn creatures are inspired by Bulgarian Kukeri costumes, while films like Pan’s Labyrinth, Spirited Away, and The Last Guardian informed the magical tone of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">“In the FAR games we use environmental storytelling to tell big stories about the world and past events,” Schmocker said. “In Herdling we tell a more personal story that’s centered around protagonist Via and the herd.”</p><p>The game can be completed in a few afternoons--roughly three to five hours--but you might take a little more time exploring its mix of mountain-inspired landscapes. The journey within Herdling resonated with GameSpot's Mark Delaney. He called it a game about finding one's purpose.</p><p>"It's a journey I'll remember for a long time thanks to its depiction of animals as unique individuals who, very much like us, are chiefly seeking love and safety," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/herdling-review-companion-quest/1900-6418398/" data-ref-id="1900-6418398">GameSpot review.</a> "It was one of my favorite experiences in video games to help them find that safety and to feel that love."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gibson added, "The most interesting thing now is that we can add to it next. We've got a plan. Admittedly, some of the plans for that stuff are kind of ambitious as well, but hopefully we can achieve some of it."</p><p>Both Gibson and Pellen stop short of detailing the nature of these ambitions, but consider the Silksong carrot back at the end of the stick. You thought we were done just because we have a release date now?</p><p>It seems that much like Hollow Knight before it, Silksong will be a major focus of Team Cherry for a long time. Despite initially launching in the early months of 2017, Hollow Knight was followed up by four pieces of free DLC, all of which added significant content by way of additional interactions with characters, new quests, boss fights, and music, as well as optimizations and quality-of-life fixes.</p><p>News of Silksong DLC invites some speculation. Like, for example, should players expect a similar number of post-launch expansions as the first game? Considering the lengthy development period for it, is the development team likely to keep adding to Silksong rather than immediately moving to another game? Will Silksong's expansions also be released for free?</p><p>The most ironic piece of this news is, of course, that Silksong was planned as the fifth and final piece of DLC for Hollow Knight before it eventually ballooned into its own game. By 2019, it had transformed into a full-fledged sequel, and the rest, as you all likely know, is history.</p><p>Now though, at long last, Silksong is actually right around the corner. It is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">currently playable at Gamescom</a> and is now officially dated for September 4, which is just weeks away. Let's just hope that DLC doesn't take cues from the main game and take a lifetime to arrive.</p>

            <p>In case you hadn't heard the many summon circle participants crying out in joy that their prayers had finally been answered, or the klaxons sounding far and wide, let me tell you the good news - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-gets-release-date-out-next-month">Silksong has a release date</a>!</p>
<p>The much anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> follow up is set to release across Switch consoles, PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, including on Xbox Game Pass in just two weeks time, on 4th September.</p>
<p>On the ground here at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, applause could be heard as the date was announced, so of course I headed out into the fray to get some first hand reactions from those waiting in line for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> demo. What I got was a mix of relief, giddy anticipation and, for one person, a little bit of stress.</p>

<p>First up, there was the lovely young gentleman who had somehow missed the news until I asked his thoughts about Silksong's release date.</p>
<p>"Wait, what?! It's coming out? Okay, I am pretty freaking excited. This is crazy, because everybody was waiting for it, and now it's so soon! Two weeks? Ahhh, I am very happy," he beamed. "I played the first Hollow Knight a few years back, and it was the first metroidvania I played, and it made me fall in love with the genre, and since then I have played many more metroidvanias and it's all because of Hollow Knight. I loved it - I hope this is going to be even better!</p>
<p>"You've just made my day."</p>

<p>"I am quite surprised it is so soon," another Gamescom attendee told me. "I've been waiting just as impatiently as everyone else."</p>
<p>"I played the original in 2017, and since then - I've been waiting!!" another added. "It's two weeks, that's wild!! When [Team Cherry] said it's this year, I thought maybe at Christmas, but… two weeks!"</p>
<p>"I am sooo, so so so surprised it is coming out so soon," I was again told. "Ahh, I can't wait!!"</p>
<p>A very eloquent chap of 12 years old told me he had been waiting for this moment for four years. "I loved the first one," he said. "It's super nice." He will "definitely" be getting Silksong day one, he informed me, with this being the game he is most excited about.</p><p>Another chap waiting in the queue for Silksong's demo told me that while he was both "surprised" and "excited", but also already feeling pretty stressed about managing to play all the games he wants to. "It's coming out right between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. I want to play all of those games! But, I will play Silksong day one," he laughed.</p>
<p>"I have been waiting for years [he gestured to his shirt which shows Hornet looking back at me]. It's absolutely great news, I have been waiting for so long."</p>
<p>Are you just as excited as this lot?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Silksong news, it has not, in fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">taken so long to release due to being stuck in development hell</a>. Rather, hype skyrocketed sales of the original game to give Team Cherry financial freedom.</p>
<p>Our Dom also braved the Gamescom queues to go hands-on with Silksong, and came away impressed with its high challenge and how Hornet's movement differs from the original game's Knight. You can check out their thoughts in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-gamescom-queues-over-an-hour-and-reddit-in-overdrive-hollow-knight-silksong-hype-has-outpaced-everything-from-opening-night-live">Eurogamer's Silksong preview here</a>.</p>
