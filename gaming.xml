			<p>Many of the Monster Hunter Wilds performance issues on PC may have become a thing of the past, thanks to a new version of a popular mod available for all games powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, modder Praydog released a new version of the REFramework mod, which significantly reduces the micro-stuttering issues caused by the game's anti-tamper tech by preventing constant scanning. The mod also addresses some crashing issues caused by DRM as well. You can find this new version of the mod on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/93?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, but if you're having issues with it like other users are reporting, you can use any of the previous nightly builds available on <a href="https://github.com/praydog/REFramework-nightly/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> that seem to be more stable as of now.</p>
<p>Performance issues aren't the only issues that impact the Monster Hunter Wilds experience, as the low challenge level for the story and a good portion of the postgame High Rank can be a little offputting for those who mastered previous generation games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. Thankfully, some mods are already available to address the low challenge level of the game, allowing hunters to<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/"> increase both monsters' health and attack power.</a></p>
<p>The above issues aside, Monster Hunter Wilds is undoubtedly among the finest entries in the series. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <p>One of Japan's biggest retailers began offering a PS5 rental service last week, but it's already fully booked thanks in large part to the popularity of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>GEO began offering the service on 28th February, neatly timed with the release of Capcom's latest monster hunting game. It's surprisingly cheap too, with a week's rental at around a fiver and two weeks for under a tenner.</p>
<p>However, the availability is completely blocked out until mid-April across all regions, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-new-ps5-rental-is-massively-popular-with-service-fully-booked-across-all-regions/">Automaton</a> reported. No appointments beyond this date are open for booking.</p>

<p>Japanese players are notorious for maintaining the quality of their gaming tech, but I'm not convinced a similar service would work here in the UK. Too many sticky controllers.</p>
<p>GEO hasn't stated how many consoles are available for rental, but the service is being provided across its 400 stores nationwide - the fact it's booked up proves the service (and Monster Hunter Wilds) are extremely popular.</p>
<p>In fact, it's yet another example of the impact Capcom's game is having over in Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">cheese naan sales are on the rise thanks to Monster Hunter Wilds' delectable food scenes</a>.</p>
<p>One Tokyo-based Nepalese restaurant thanked Monster Hunter directly for boosting its cheese naan sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">Monster Hunter Wilds reached the highest concurrent player numbers on Steam for the series</a>, quickly reaching over 1.3 million players just a couple of days after launch. That's over four times higher than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, which reached more than 300,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>Not only that, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds is Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>, reaching over 8m units sold in just three days across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

		<p>The unconfirmed but widely reported on Gears of War Collection is expected to be revealed Xbox Direct but ahead of that we may have some bad news as it seems like the pack will include co-op, but not multiplayer.</p>
<p>This all started yesterday when a Twitter user <a href="https://xcancel.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897091375457542358">Detective Seeds</a> posted “Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August. It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.” He then added “For further on Gears of War collection. The game is loaded onto PS storefront on the back end (this is the same with others I have said in the past). It shows 1 player and does not show support for additional players. I asked about co-op, but no clarification on that yet.”</p>


<p>As Detective Seeds has a relatively small Twitter following and no track record, this claim was widely dismissed. However, the following day, Window Central’s Jez Corden became aware of the claim and backed it up: “I too have heard no multiplayer.&nbsp;I’m not sure why they did it this way.”</p>
<p>As&nbsp; the posts suggest, we are expecting Gears of War to arrive on PlayStation for the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/rumours-suggest-more-xbox-games-will-be-coming-to-ps5-and-switch/"> first time ever</a>, and with Forza arriving this April that just leaves Halo as the last big Microsoft exclusive to make the jump.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there are rumours that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War E-Day</a> is now scheduled for 2026.</p>
<p><em>Source: Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j3zj7p/gears_of_war_collection_is_loaded_onto_ps/">1</a>/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j4efhz/jez_corden_confirms_theres_no_pvp_multiplayer_in/">2</a></em></p>

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth patch is now live on PC, introducing a fix for an AMD Radeon GPUs-specific issue and some improvements.</p>
<p>The 1.00.3 patch, which is around 18.3 GB big for the Steam version of the game, introduces game stability improvements, fixing several unspecified bugs. The new patch also fixes an issue that caused crashes while playing the game using certain AMD Radeon GPUs and reduces the package size when downloading on Steam Deck, which is a great improvement for those who have limited storage space on their systems. Unfortunately, this seems to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/527588008025654786?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything the patch does</a>, so it's yet another minor patch that doesn't address the performance issue that many are experiencing.</p>
<p>Considering how the main development team seems to have fully moved on to the development of the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's not surprising to see Final Fantasy VII Rebirth not getting any new features. Thankfully, modders have come to the rescue once again, adding features not available in the vanilla game, such as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-cid-vincent-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">special menu</a> that allows quick editing of the combat party and even adding Vincent and Cid to the party, although the two characters are not playable.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn Remake</a> players are still sharing bug reports with UK developer Ballistic Moon, but there's apparently no one left to respond. “The studio has effectively closed now," one anonymous source told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">Insider Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>An undisclosed number of layoffs were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ballistic-moon-layoffs/">publicly announced last September</a>, shortly before the Until Dawn remake's launch in October. According to IG's source, these amounted to "roughly 40 employees". "Around 20" developers were allegedly kept on for post-launch support until they themselves were laid off last December, leaving a handful of employees "at most" alongside studio founders. "There are no employees in public relations, marketing, or development left."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ballistic Moon were reportedly unsuccessful in their attempts to secure funding or publishers for new projects, despite pitches. New Until Dawn projects with publisher Sony were reportedly "discussed but never came to fruition". That's despite actors Peter Stomare and Hayden Panettiere both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-actors-hint-at-a-sequel-but-theres-reason-to-be-sceptical">making possible hints toward a sequel last year</a>. Original Until Dawn creators Supermassive - who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">went through a round of cuts last January</a> - have yet to make any announcements.</p>
<p>"Most who spoke said that it was a generally good place to work," write IG, although one of their sources claims that the layoffs followed overtime, and “weeks” of unpaid development work. “Nice reward for our hard work,” they said.</p>
<p>Ahem. Pay your workers. Pay your fucking workers. It's better that no-one does overtime but if they do, pay your fucking workers and pay them well. If you don't pay your workers, you shouldn't ever be allowed to be in a position of power as long as you live. Pay your workers. It would be better if nobody got laid off but if it happens, make sure you've paid your workers. Pay your fucking workers. Pay them. If you don't pay your workers they should be legally allowed to climb in through your window at dinner time and eat the chicken off your plate every night until they've eaten enough chicken to settle the debt. Pay your workers.</p>
<p>Sony and Ballistic Moon have yet to comment on IG's report. We've reached out for comment ourselves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Minecraft developer Mojang has announced a new Minecraft Live event, to be held on 22nd March at 6pm UK time, and teased that it will contain "new game drops".
</p>
<p>
Does this mean new "drops" in existing Minecraft games, or the dropping of new Minecraft games entirely? The event's brief teaser video does not say.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, however, the teaser does note that "exclusive movie content" is also on the way, separate to the ambiguous dropping mentioned above.

Mojang's Minecraft Movie tie-in is likely the A Minecraft Movie Hero Pack which leaked online last week. It contains character skins for the upcoming film's main roster - including a beardy Jack Black as Steve, and Aquaman in a pink jacket.

At <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-live-digital-showcase-returns-later-this-month-with-news-about-our-games-and-more">the last Minecraft Live, in September 2024</a>, Mojang announced it was ditching its singular big summer update for multiple updates spread throughout the year. The next of these, presumably, will be revealed later this month.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-witcher-casts-first-game-exclusive-character<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The fourth season of Netflix's Witcher adaptation is on its way, and we've now got word of a new character for the show. That's not <em>too </em>exciting in itself, but this particular addition to the show marks a notable change. You see, this is the Netflix series' first game-exclusive character to pop up on the small screen.</p>
<p>Since its conception, Netflix's Witcher team has refrained from adapting anything particularly game-specific, sticking instead with characters and beasties based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novels and short stories. Of course, there has been the occasional reference back to CDPR's own Sapkowski-based works, such as Henry Cavill's Geralt taking a nice, steamy bath (see header image above).</p>
<p>That's changing for the show's fourth season, however, with the reported addition of actor Jack Myers. According to Witcher fan site <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/03/01/netflixs-the-witcher-casts-its-first-character-from-the-games/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, Myers - who has starred in the likes of The Crown and Call the Midwife, as well as lending his vocal talents to games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Dying Light 2 - has landed the role of Roderick de Wett, a character from the original Witcher game.</p>

<p>Now, if you haven't heard of Roderick de Wett, don't worry - he didn't exactly have a huge role in the first Witcher. He was a Nilfgaardian Count, and member of the religious knightly order known as The Order of the Flaming Rose (or sometimes just The Order).</p>
<p>Roderick isn't an especially nice chap, and Geralt isn't a fan of his. To give you an idea of his personality, here is what his <a href="https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/61e8445b4b99d146d6c747b9631a83ce">Gwent card reads</a>:</p>
<p>"Count de Wett is exceptionally loathsome and arrogant, but at least he enjoys a little dice poker on the side."</p>
<p>While Roderick only - thus far - appears in CDPR's video game, there is a potential link to Sapkowski's written Witcher work. A Nilfgaardian noble by the name of Joachim de Wett pops up in books Time of Contempt, The Tower of the Swallow and The Lady of the Lake. Meanwhile, <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Joachim_de_Wett#Trivia">Joachim's skull can also be found in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>. Given the name and both characters' backgrounds, it seems likely they are related in some way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-today-new-zone-dungeons-systems-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-gets-free-wilds-of-talandre-expansion-on-march-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago, NCSoft and Amazon are launching the Wilds of Talandre expansion for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty today in Western territories.</p>
<p>This free update adds a ton of new content to the game, starting with the titular new zone of Talandre, which expands the playable space with a region filled with new challenges and rewards. Players can explore the Temple of Truth, face off against powerful new field bosses, and advance their characters to level 55 while new events are slowly unlocked.</p>
<p>Talandre has long been inhospitable to settlement due to its rugged terrain and unusually rampant demonic beasts. However, it later became home to refugees fleeing the oppression of the Crimson Family, who founded the village of Herba. Still, due to the harsh environment and deadly monsters, much of the natural world remains untouched.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre expansion adds Solo dungeons where players can hone their skills before going into Group dungeons, which are also being expanded with the new, more challenging 3-Star dungeons. There are three of them: Rancorwood, Hall of Tragedy, and Chapel of Madness, all of which are unlocked at the new level cap of 55.</p>
<p>If you're more into PvP, the new inter-server Nebula Island is a place where players can engage in PvP and PvE activities in six different regions, including one peaceful zone (Fog Forest) and four war zones where PvP is always enabled. Players can spend up to 7 hours per week on the island, with additional time available through Nebula Charge Stones. Nebula Island will be enabled in a week from now.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre patch also revamps the Weapon mastery system and adds the new Artifact system. With regard to the former, Weapon mastery is now gained independently of which weapon the player has equipped; instead, they now have the option in the UI to select which weapon will receive the Weapon Mastery points. Mastery experience can also be increased through Weapon Mastery Seals acquired from various content. Lastly, Weapon mastery can now grow up to a maximum level of 200 per weapon.</p>

<p>As for Artifacts, they can be obtained from Nebula Island and the Abyss dungeons in Talandre. The system consists of six parts: 4 Talistones, a Solarstone and a Lunarstone, each with unique stats and effects. There are 14 different sets across three levels (2 Common, 4 Uncommon, and 8 Rare), with some stats randomly determined upon acquisition. Players can trigger set bonuses by equipping 2, 4, or 6 matching items from the same set. The Solar Stone grants an active ability, while the Lunar Stone grants a passive ability when equipped. Lastly, there are a few additions to the Lifestyle content featured in Throne and Liberty, such as 24 new fish, 10 new cooking recipes, and additional collectibles like the Cornelian Cherry Tree.</p>
<p>The Wilds of Talandre update also improves some aspects of combat and movement in Throne and Liberty. The basic attack range of short-range melee weapons was increased, the movement speed reduction that applied to characters while using attack skills was removed, the player character will be more responsive after using movement skills, and the camera can be rotated when executing skills that previously locked the camera.</p>

<p>According to a reliable insider, the Gears of War collection will not feature PvP but include campaign co-op.</p>



<p>Yesterday, new details about the Gears of War collection surfaced through Detective Seeds on <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1897139827772170355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Their post stated that the game was seemingly added to the PlayStation Store backend, revealing new information about it. The leaker reported that the game will arrive in mid-2025 (August) and will not include multiplayer PvP content; the focus will be only on the campaign. A reliable insider has now corroborated the information about the Gears of War collection not featuring multiplayer PvP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jez Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897334037204946947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> later to reveal what he knows about Gears of War Collection’s PvP status. In his recent thread on X, Corden stated, “I, too, have heard no multiplayer.” In the same thread, Corden was asked whether the collection would include campaign co-op, and he replied, “Yeah, co-op, but not PvP, is what I heard.”&nbsp;Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1897535168300163490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that he is “looking into the Gears collection rumors” to find something concrete. </p>



<p><span>In his recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7FO40pCi8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a>, another leaker, eXtas1s, also revealed some details about the Gears of War Collection and E-Day</span>. According to him, the Gears of War collection will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year, and the game will be available for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on Day One. Gears of War E-Day is reportedly scheduled for 2026 but has a “slim” chance of being postponed to 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Split Fiction - released under the EA Originals label - won't be included in either tier as a "select new game". Hazelight's previous games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-way-out">A Way Out</a> are both included.</p>
<p>"It certainly seems like false advertising," wrote one forum user. "This is so unfair, EA Play Pro even increased the price and we still can't get the latest games," wrote another.</p>
<p>The latest additions to the service are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc24">EA Sports FC 24</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">EA Sports F1 24</a>. The available game trials are all sports games.</p>
<p>Another of EA's other most recently published games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, is also not available on the subscription - though it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-in-playstation-plus-next-month">added to PS Plus this month</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction received five stars in Eurogamer's review</a>.

            <p>We don't score reviews at Rock Paper Shotgun. Some might tell you this is because we view numeric scores as stifling oversimplifications of the wonderful, strange, and personal experiences videogames can offer, but it's really because the refurbished work keyboards we're assigned when hired all have their number keys gummed up with Marmite and none of us want to touch them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have scored games in the past, however. Pay attention, because I'm about to divulge a tale of corruption so vile and petty that I fear my career will never recover: I have, on occasion, reluctantly docked 0.2% of a point from a game's review score for being awkward to alt+tab out of so I can take notes. I will not apologise. This is an accessibility feature. It's vital that I can access my notes doc at all times, lest I fail to capture some choice impression like "more like ASSassin's Creed: BOREigins lmao lol".</p>
<p>I've just today found out that <a href="https://youtu.be/e8jv24NjOWQ">Steam added a feature a year ago</a> that lets you pull up a notepad from the overlay tab and jot down thoughts, and I've only found out because a new update lets you now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/notes/list">access these notes from the web</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-users-react-ecstatically-to-update-that-lets-them-access-their-heaving-game-notes-via-the-web-also-it-fixes-monster-hunter-wilds-video-recording/">PC Gamer</a>). People <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1j3z2pt/notes_are_officially_on_web/">are apparently chuffed</a> about it! My first thought was "how is this useful to anyone except me specifically?".  Then I remembered those blank sections you'd sometimes get in the back of game manuals. Then I thought about recent games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a> or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered</a>. There are thankfully still games that embrace notetaking, and this feels like a reasonably untaxing feature on Steam's end.</p>

<p>There are, I'm discovering, plenty of other use cases. "I wish we could add notes to games on the wishlist. I have so many games that I've added over the years and can't remember why," Redditor bugfix00 writes. 

</p><p>Other redditor Madnesis adds: "Trying to paste a screenshot into my notes while using the Steam overlay would result in pasting a “⍰” instead of the actual screenshot. Man, I’m so glad I got a workaround but would have appreciated it sooner - so I could’ve saved all those STALKER 2 artifact spots in my notes Steam notes directly."</p>
<p>Alongside the web notes feature, the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545602406545622946">Steam beta update</a> also offers "improved display of notifications for in-progress achievements," in big picture mode, a fix to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> video recording, and support for the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/micro/">8BitDo Micro gamepad</a> - a tiny lozenge of a controller that looks fun to own but awkward to use, especially if you just had to type '8' and now have Marmite on your fingers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite having had a sort of blueprint for decades, top-down action role-playing games are a little hard to get right. Ever since the release of the original Diablo and its wildly more popular sequel, many games have attempted to replicate the experience crafted by Blizzard, and only a handful succeeded at providing satisfying experiences powered by the simple core gameplay loop of exploring dungeons, defeating enemies, obtaining new loot, improving character build to take on even more difficult challenges. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/">Path of Exile</a> and a few other games proved that it is possible to challenge the dominance of the Diablo series by offering what ARPG players really want, which often involves a good wealth of customization options.</p>
<p>While it is too early to say if Eko Software's Dragonkin: The Banished will indeed be able to offer an experience that will please fans of the genre, the potential is most definitely there. The Early Access version currently only features the very first chapter of the adventure and some endgame activities that will likely get expanded once the game hits its 1.0 version, but what can be experienced is definitely promising, even in its current rough state.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304135423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As those who tried the game's recent demo already know, Dragonkin: The Banished offers right from the beginning the chance to see the power level that the game's four characters will be able to reach, taking advantage of a prologue that sets the story up, detailing how the world was corrupted by the blood of dragons that is causing monstrous creatures to rise from the depths of the earth. While these characters do fall into the ARPG archetypes that are found in pretty much every game in the genre, they feel diverse enough. The Knight, for example, combines offense and defense for a varied playstyle; the Oracle utilizes elemental magic with different ranges and AOEs while also offering surprisingly good mobility options; the Barbarian hits harder and harder when the Rage value increases, showing his true strength when overwhelmed by enemy hordes. A fourth character that falls into the Ranger/Rogue archetype is also briefly available during the prologue but is not yet available for the main adventure.</p>
<p>While dominating enemies in the prologue using these prebuilt godlike heroes is fun for a short while, the prologue alone doesn't do a great job at highlighting some of the features that set Dragonkin: The Banished apart from similar games, as it only becomes possible to access the main menu, and thus the many customization options the game has to offer, only a few minutes after selecting the character among the Knight, Oracle and Barbarian, and reaching the City of Montescail, which serves as the main hub. One of these features is the Ancestral Grid, a massive grid that comes with different shapes that depend on the character it belongs to, and a huge number of nodes that are progressively unlocked as the character levels up, where it is possible to place Fragments, items collected from enemies that represent character skills and modifiers. What makes this system very interesting is how modifiers all have some pretty unique shapes that fit into multiple nodes and can affect multiple character skills depending on the placement, turning skill customization into a sort of engaging puzzle game that requires some serious optimization to get the best out of any modifier. The modifiers themselves look varied enough, as they grant tons of different properties to skills, including damage and speed boosts, so it definitely feels like the system has a ton of potential, even in its very first iteration.</p>
<p>Another feature that sets Dragonkin: The Banished apart from other ARPGs is the ability to bring a Wyrmling along, a small companion dragon that can be chosen among four different ones that come with their own unique elements, bonus attributes, and skills. Interestingly enough, the Wyrmlings' skills are also placed on the Arcane Grid and can be influenced by regular modifiers, further increasing customization options. In addition, when a character skill is affected by 8 or more modifiers, it enters Symbiosis with the currently equipped Wyrmling, increasing its power and granting it the elemental properties of the companion dragon. Achieving this requires perfect optimization of the Arcane Grid, which further makes the customization system way more involving than simply equipping skills and activating modifiers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304172246_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even when it comes to its main hub, Dragonkin: The Banished attempts to do something slightly different from the norm. Instead of offering every possible service right at the start of the game, the City of Monstescail will evolve based on its Prosperity Level, which is increased by visiting the world and defeating major Dragons. Besides the Jeweler, who can produce rings with items looted after defeating enemies, the Apothecary, who can upgrade potions, and the Dark Merchant, who buys from the player unwanted items, more services will be added in future versions of the game to give players even more reasons to fully explore the world and increase the city's prosperity.</p>
<p>Despite being in Early Access, Dragonkin: The Banished already offers plenty of replay value, with multiple difficulty levels that also increase rewards and quality of loot, and proper endgame activities like hunts, unique quests of variable durations, difficulty, and rewards, and Dungeon Purification, where the player has to close a rift at the end of dungeons. All of these activities allow the player to push the limits of the current gameplay systems to the maximum, allowing them to get their hands on powerful loot and Fragments, although, with potentially huge changes on the horizon, spending too much time on these activities may not be very worthwhile right now.</p>
<p>The potential big changes coming to Dragonkin: The Banished in the future aren't the only thing that may not make it worthwhile for most players to start playing the game right away in its first iteration. The unfinished user interface, plenty of bugs, including some progression blockers that, at least, are not critical, textures loading in seconds after a new area is loaded, missing resolution options suddenly becoming available, wonky controller support and general lack of the most basic polish are only some of the issues that suggest the game wasn't exactly ready for even an Early Access release, so it may be wise to wait for a few patches before diving in.</p>
<p>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</p>

There is naught but to perish.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><em>Wizardry Variants Daphne</em> is a 3D dungeon RPG, a completely new addition to the <em>Wizardry</em> series. The game system follows the play cycle of the traditional 3D dungeon RPGs, with players progressing deeper into dungeons called Abyss, by repeatedly getting stronger, resupplying in towns, and battling and collecting items in dungeons. Battles with enemies proceed in a command battle system, and a formation of up to six characters, including the player, can enjoy highly strategic battles that make full use of spells and skills.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Penta, the recently arrived luchador from AEW, will be added in a later pack, and he's not the only former All Elite Wrestling veteran on the way. Billy Gunn will be making his WWE return alongside his New Age Outlaws teammate, Road Dogg, and so is "the world's strongest man," Mark Henry.</p><p>The final wave of DLC characters will be a blast from the past, the 1980s, to be specific. For the first time in a WWE video game, Jesse "The Body" Ventura will be available alongside Paul "Mr. Wonderful" Orndorff, Junk Yard Dog, Tito Santana, and Sid Justice... whom long-time wrestling fans may remember as both Sid Vicious and Sycho Sid.</p><p>There are a few guest characters whose names have yet to be released, including two "special celebrity guests" and three NBA players.

                <p>NordVPN is running a limited-time discount that saves you 70% on its two-year subscription plans. Four different plans are available for NordVPN--Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime. Each one is more expensive than the last, but all four are currently on sale. You’ll get the best deal when signing up for its most expensive package, Prime, which is down to $201.36 for 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months), but even the standard <strong>Basic plan is a great deal at just $81.36 for 24 months (was $278.16)</strong>. As a bonus, <strong>signing up for a two-year deal on the Plus or Complete plans will get you an additional six months for free</strong> via an emailed coupon code. Opt for the Prime plan, and this gets bumped to one year. You can use the code to extend your plan or gift it to a friend and get them some free added privacy or a way to access the catalog of other countries’ streaming services.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the costs of each two-year plan:</p><h2>NordVPN Plans</h2><ul><li>Basic -- $81.36 (<del>$278.16</del>)</li><li>Plus --$105.58 (<del>$359.76</del>)</li><li>Complete -- $129.36 (<del>$438.96</del>)</li><li>Prime -- $201.36 (<del>$743.76</del>)</li></ul><p>All four plans get you access to the secure NordVPN network and threat protection through its DNS servers. They also support 10 simultaneous connections, so you should have no problem running all your favorite gadgets through the VPN at once.</p><p>Stepping up to the Plus plan introduces perks like ad and tracker blockers, advanced browsing protection, and anti-malware protection. There’s even a password manager that works across all your devices automatically.</p><p>The Complete plan provides 1TB of encrypted cloud storage--for an extra $24, that’s not a bad offer. Prime is the most comprehensive plan offered by NordVPN, getting you NordProtect--an identity protection service that scans the dark web for your data, offers credit freeze assistance, and even provides you with up to $1 million in identity theft coverage.</p><p>NordVPN is a pretty popular service, and getting access to it at these low prices is mighty enticing. And since three of the four plans get you additional months for free, it’s a great time to sign up.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

		<p>After a few years of hinting that The Last of Us Part 3 might be in the works, Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann seems to have a change of heart.&nbsp; In an interview with Variety about Season 2 of the The Last of Us television show Neil is asked about a third game.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I was waiting for this question,” Druckmann says, sighing, when I bring up the prospect of a third game. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Neil himself had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/03/the-last-of-us-3-ps5-naughty-dog-interview/">previously said </a>he does have a idea for Part 3. “I don’t have a story, but I do have that concept,” he stated back in February 2024. “That, to me, is as exciting as one, as exciting as two, is its own thing, yet has this through line for all 3. So it does feel like… there’s probably one more chapter to this story.”</p>


<p>Further back in 2021 Druckmann said he had the outline of a story and there had been “quite a bit” of discussion about the game.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Naughty Dog have done this, after the release of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Naughty Dog Creative Director Shaun Escayg<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/22/naughty-dog-doubt-that-they-are-finished-with-uncharted/"> said</a> “To say the Uncharted world is done… I doubt that highly,” and then a few years later, we were told quite bluntly they were<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/naughty-dog-uncharted-5/"> “done” with franchise.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future. However they have stated they are working on “multiple” single player games but clearly not Uncharted or The Last of Us.</p>

<p>The Variety interview also gives us a few hints of what to expect from Season 2 of the television show and from what Bella Ramsey is saying, <em>that scene</em> will be in this series.</p>
<p>“I’m scared of some of the bigger emotional scenes, leaving not satisfied with my performance,” she says, before explaining that that for “the darkest scene this season”, they listened to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBOgtp0Hac">Peanut Butter Jelly Time. </a>&nbsp;Why they did that is not explained, it’s a very shouty upbeat song and certainly not what would pop in to your head when someone’s head is po…. let’s not finish that sentence. “I was on the floor, my eyes absolutely burning with these menthol tears, and I’m just saying, ‘Peanut Butter&nbsp;<em>Jelllll-y</em>,’” adds Bella.</p>
<p>It is also revealed we will meet Eugene, played by Joe Pantoliano, a character who is only referenced in the game as the owner of the canabis den in which&nbsp; Ellie and Dina spend a night in.</p>

            <p>
Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

The senior executive has a long and storied history within the tabletop space, including selling and promoting the most beloved games ever.</p>

<h2>Heiko Windfelder's Retirement Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/03/05/veteran-kosmos-senior-exec-heiko-windfelder-who-oversaw-rise-of-catan-exit-games-at-german-publisher-is-retiring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Board Game Wire</a>, Heiko Windfelder is retiring from Kosmos a mere two years after long-time managing director Michael Fleissner retired. When this occ urred, operational management fell to Windfelder alongside Thilan Tran and Matthias Kienzle. Both Tran and Kienzle will continue managing in a dual leadership position.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=e9ruoc2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=2rF9XKqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both Tran and Kienzle issued the following statement regarding Windfelder's retirement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 30 years, Kosmos has developed into the highest-selling games publisher in the field of family and adult games.</p>

<p>“During this time, Heiko Windfelder has played a very influential role in shaping the fortunes of the company.</p>

<p>“With his passion for special stories, his creativity and his feel for special titles and exceptional authors, he has made a significant contribution to leading the publishing house to this pole position.</p>

<p>“For this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the management and the entire Kosmos team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Heiko Windfelder joined Kosmos in 1995, it was the same year they published <em>Catan</em>, one of the most popular board games in the business with over 45 million copies sold, not counting certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prestige artisanal component</a> sets.</p>

<p>A second popular board game series nurtured by Windfelder was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-game-gate-between-worlds-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Exit</em></a> family series. This is a series of small box escape room board games. Each entry is themed around a different scenario like a sunken ship, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and even an officially licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> scenario where you must escape the temptations of The One Ring.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Windfelder served as program manager with responsibility for the company's toy and game lines. These included <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Imhotep</em>, and the Spiel des Jahres winning <em>Sky Team</em>.</p>
