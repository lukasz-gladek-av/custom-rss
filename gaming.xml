"Post Void is a masterpiece of compulsive motion and hypnotic, irresistible sounds," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/post-void-review">wrote Sin</a> of YCJY Games's "orgiastic" shooter. "It does something to my brain that I've never experienced before." The developer's just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/keep-driving">Keep Driving</a> seems a lot less inclined to scramble your grey matter, though it's partial to the old rose-tinted goggles. It's a droll, backward-glancing and <em>slightly</em> ominous 2D management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in which you drive to a music festival on the other side of the country. Along the way, you will pick up hitchhikers, upgrade your car, fill your boot with random junk, and participate in turn-based, non-lethal "combat" with dawdling children and obstinate tractors. Here's a trailer.

<p>
The whole thing seems very spaced-out, for all the excess of menus, but there's the suggestion that Life Lessons of some kind await. "Remember to take it easy," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/">the Steam page</a> remarks, in the manner of somebody smiling and noddling at a toddler to stop them looking at the mushroom cloud behind them. "You're young. You have time."</p>
<p>The game's influences run a boisterous gamut: "Oregon Trail II, FTL, Two Lane Blacktop, Paris Texas, Jalopy, Gloom Haven, The 7th Continent, and the developer's lives". But it all comes together beautifully on the screen, with artfully worn and dusty pixelart backdrops and a catchy inside-outside effect, whereby you're both peering over the dashboard <em>and</em> watching yourself drive. Ah, swish. Here are some bulletpoints:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A procedurally generated pixel art world to explore one road at a time.
</p>
<p>
A nostalgic early 2000s setting with an emphasis on the analogue .
</p>
<p>
Use turn-based 'combat' to solve situations (like getting stuck behind a tractor).
</p>
<p>
Pick up misfits, oddballs and lost souls as you go.
</p>
<p>
Collect songs and listen to a mix CD of local Swedish indie bands.
</p>
<p>
Multiple endings to unlock when you return to the road.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I guess the natural foil for this is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a>, which is similarly preoccupied with the art of car maintenance, but also 3D, post-apocalyptic and paranormal. If you enjoy swapping stories with strangers on the road, but think horseless carriages are for chumps, maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>.

A lone piece of concept art shows shadowy figures in a cave pointing to golden rays of light. </p><p>Then there was Dark Math Games. This studio is working on a “true detective RPG” called <em>XXX Nightshift</em>. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3261450/XXX_NIGHTSHIFT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Steam page</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an actual trailer</a></span>. It claims a headcount of roughly 20 people, about half of which reportedly worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Its art director is Timo Albert, who is credited under publishing for the original game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/a-disco-elysium-successor-studio-has-been-announced-for-the-second-time-today-meaning-there-are-now-4-companies-battling-for-the-title-of-za-ums-true-inheritor/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/a-disco-elysium-successor-studio-has-been-announced-for-the-second-time-today-meaning-there-are-now-4-companies-battling-for-the-title-of-za-ums-true-inheritor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The studio also lists Kaur Kender</a></span>, an executive producer on <em>Disco Elysium</em> who was also at the center of the controversy of ZA/UM founders leaving the studio, as a director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/14810396/officers&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/14810396/officers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who resigned last year</a></span>. </p><p>Now there’s also Summer Eternal, the third studio announced today whose main distinction is that it’s led by two of the original writers on <em>Disco Elysium</em>, Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina. It also includes ZA/UM writer Dora Klindžić, who had been working with Tuulik on the direct sequel at that studio up until the mass layoffs earlier this year. </p><p> “I’ve seen good work done at ZA/UM,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.si.com/videogames/news/disco-elysium-dev-zaum-layoffs-last-writer-speaks-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Sports Illustrated</em></a></span> at the time. “I’ve also seen management and production staff terrorizing creatives, lying, playing power games, turning people against each other, destroying relationships and people’s self-esteem.” She added, “The mask has slipped from the face of capital. What remains at ZA/UM is a cold, careless company where managers wage war against their own creatives, where artistry is second to property, and where corporate strategy is formed by an arrogant disdain for their own audience.”</p><p>In keeping with that sentiment, Summer Eternal is also launching as an art collective and seeking to re-engage with artists, designers, and others who previously worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em> as well as others. The group’s website lays out its manifesto, artistic vision, and studio setup which is a worker-owned co-op. It sounds like it’s still in the earliest stages of figuring out what its first RPG will be. </p><p> “I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik wrote in a press release. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I’ve been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let’s do it fresh from the start, but this time let’s not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.” </p><p>It’s unclear how this will all shakeout. We likely won’t see finished games from many of these teams for at least a couple of years. At ZA/UM, meanwhile, the only remaining projects appear to be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Disco Elysium</em> mobile spin-off</a></span> and a completely unrelated RPG set in an entirely new fictional world. Robert Kurvitz, the original creator, seems to have his own studio, Red Info, but it’s unclear what it’s up to at the moment. He delivered a talk over the summer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqYGh078W0I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqYGh078W0I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on how to build worlds in video games</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming understands that a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition is in development. Its content will be sold as a separate DLC for those with the existing game.</p>



<p>The Definitive Edition is said to have around 10-15 hours of additional content, with a new story quest, side quests, activities, and outfits. </p>



<p>Details on when the edition and/or DLC will be released and its price are still in flux. Still, some sources have suggested that it could be released in 2025 to bolster Warner Bros.’s diminishing gaming revenue following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weak performance of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>. It’s been suggested that the DLC will be between $20 and $30.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was released at the beginning of 2023 and, as of January 2024, sold over 24 million copies. The game is still in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 10 best-selling games in 2024 in the US</a> at number 10.</p>



<p>Earlier in the year, Warner Bros. Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels&nbsp;said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-a-priority-for-warner-bros-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a successor to Hogwarts Legacy</a> “is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road.” So there’s still a lot of time to wait for those looking forward to a sequel.</p>



<p>As for when the Definitive Edition/DLC will be announced, it remains to be seen, but with a potential 2025 release date on the cards, it could be sooner rather than later.</p>

Despite the thin profile, the Baseus Blade is able to pack in a digital readout that displays a lot of useful real-time information like remaining battery capacity, power input, and power output from each port.</p><h3>The Baseus Blade can fast charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally</h3><p>This is a great charger for gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Switch. Both the ROG Ally and Steam Deck suffer from a short battery life when gaming on the go. During our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-review">Steam Deck review</a>, we found games like God of War or Spider-Man would tap out in under two hours. At the end of the day, you'll never get the full potential out of your Steam Deck or ROG Ally if you're not equipped with a decent portable charger. The Baseus Blade can fast charge all three at their maximum rate. It supports up to 100W of charging over USB-C, which is more than enough for the Steam Deck's charging rate of 38W, the Rog Ally's charging rate of 65W, and the Nintendo Switch's charging rate of 18W. </p><h3>The Baseus Blade can <u>fully</u> charge a Steam Deck or ROG Ally</h3><p>The ROG Ally and Steam Deck both consume about 40Whr going from full to empty. The Baseus Blade has a 20,000mAh capacity or 74Whr battery. If you factor in 80% power efficiency, then you should expect the Baseus Blade to charge either gaming handheld about <strong>1.5 times</strong>. That's why it's better to get a larger capacity like this than a 10,000mAh power bank, which cannot charge these handhelds from empty to full even once.</p><h3>Looking for more deals?</h3><p>This is easily one of the best  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-steam-deck-deals">Steam Deck deals</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">Nintendo Switch deals</a> available right now, and absolutely worth considering if you find yourself short on power all too often.

    <p><span>Today's third Disco Elysium staff offshoot.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Summer Eternal" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, today’s third new studio of former <em>Disco Elysium</em> developers, has announced its establishment. Described as an “art collective / <a title="Genres > RPG [16,701 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> studio,” the developer aims to gather author, writers, and designers who worked on <em>Disco Elysium</em>, as well as new talent, to create something “completely fresh and original.” <span id="more-920990"></span></p><p>“I believe that the last time around, we made something genre-breaking,” said studio co-founder and <em>Disco Elysium</em> writer Argo Tuulik in a press release. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged—for five fucking years I’ve been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind—let’s do it fresh from the start, but this time let’s not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.”</p><p>According to the studio, the goal of Summer Eternal is to create a worker-owned, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [205 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a>, and liberating space that ensures that every worker, every creative, and every player has a voice.</p><p>Some of the studio’s staff members include:</p><ul><li>Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, who were among the five writers of <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</li><li>Lenval Brown, who is a voice actor known for his voice work on <em>Disco Elysium</em>.</li><li>Dora Klindzic, who was a principal writer at <a title="Companies > ZA/UM [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/za-um">ZA/UM</a>.</li><li>Anastasia Ivanova, who was a senior concept artist at ZA/UM.</li><li>Michael Oswell, who was the graphic designer at ZA/U.</li><li>Aleksandar Gavrilovic, who was the managing director of game developer studio Gamechuck.</li><li>Plus more to be announced in the coming weeks.</li></ul><p>Tuulik continued, “Honesty, transparency and true equality to the best of our abilities is what we vow to adhere to in our relentless pursuit of artistic highs and social change. Paraphrasing Noam Chomsky, the goal here is to, ‘All the world over, back the masses against the classes.’ We invite you to judge us by our <a title="Genres > Action [2,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s not our words. You *should* question our integrity and scrutinize our methods, ’cause many a moneyman will put on a ‘Sex Pistols’ shirt to tap into punk chicks. Ask to see our hearts and hold them up against the light.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

It also introduces a new electric motor design — already in use on high-end hybrid sports cars like the <a href="https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/auto/sf90-stradale">Ferrari SF90</a> — to the world of sim racing, improving realism while also shrinking the hardware.</p><p>The Thrustmaster T598 can be preordered today for $499.99 (including a set of racing pedals) and will be available starting on October 19th. Although it is compatible with both PCs and consoles, it’s limited for use with only the PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>Direct drive sim racing wheel bases are often preferred by enthusiasts because the steering wheel is connected directly to an electric motor, instead of using gears or belts, producing more torque, which creates more convincing feedback effects for a driver.</p><p>Wheel bases using a direct drive system typically rely on radial flux motors, but they come with some drawbacks. Their design tends to be larger to help dissipate excess heat that’s generated, and because the steering wheel shaft rotates perpendicular to the motor’s magnetic field, it creates occasional moments of drag. That can produce a sensation known as “cogging” where a steering wheel feels like it’s jerking as it’s turned.</p><div><figcaption><em>The steering wheel included with the T598 can be easily swapped out.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Thrustmaster</cite></p></div><p>Racing sims will compensate for cogging through algorithms that prevent those jerky motions from affecting a vehicle in a game, but Thrustmaster’s T598 solves the problem by instead using an axial flux motor (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/yasa-motors-mercedes-axial-flux-2024/">originally demonstrated by Michael Faraday</a> way back in 1821) with a different design making the magnetic field run parallel with the motion of the steering wheel’s shaft. Thrustmaster says its Direct Axial Drive technology nearly eliminates cogging while the new wheel base delivers five newton-meters of constant torque to increase force feedback effects and responsiveness.</p><p>The T598 wheel base features four buttons and a small screen for adjusting settings and saving or loading user profiles. When used with the included 11.8-inch steering wheel that features magnetic paddle shifters, additional buttons, but no display, the wheel base’s screen can show game details like speed or a racer’s position.</p><p>The new wheel base also comes with a set of Thrustmaster’s Raceline Pedals LTE (Long Term Evolution) that use the company’s proprietary magnetic Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and longevity. The firmness of the pedals can also be adjusted by swapping to a different set of included springs that increase tension.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Epic Games is preparing to launch Fortnitemares 2024, this year's edition of the Halloween event inside Fortnite. The latest gameplay trailer has provided a glimpse at the many collaborations featured in this event, leaving fans very excited about what will go live shortly.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Fortnitemares 2024 begins tomorrow morning after the server maintenance. The event will go live alongside version 31.40 and introduce playable characters from horror movies such as Leatherface from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-never-gonna-give-you-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a> and Billy from Saw. Moreover, Edward Scissorhands (from Tim Burton's 1990 masterpiece film) and a couple of Marvel characters (Venom and Mephisto) are also seen. Speaking of gameplay additions coming with Fortnitemares, players can look forward to an explosive pumpkin launcher weapon and Billy's Tricycle vehicle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnitemares 2024 Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g909vB-BSXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Over seven years after its debut, Fortnite Battle Royale continues to run strong, in addition to side games like LEGO Fortnite. Of course, it also helps that the Epic Games Store successfully <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on mobile, with Fortnite once again available in Europe to iOS players.</p>
<p>During the recent Unreal Fest, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-our-company-is-now-financially-sound-gamers-gravitate-towards-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you that Epic is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets, and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong. </em></p>
<p><em>When you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>Fortnite will be a key component even in the upcoming Disney-themed persistent universe that Disney <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-invests-1-5-billion-in-epic-to-create-a-persistent-universe-in-fortnite-based-on-its-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested</a> $1.5 billion in. Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-talks-about-disneys-persistent-universe-in-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a few days ago that players will have the opportunity to move seamlessly from Fortnite to the Disney 'metaverse' and vice versa.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>After a hard day's editing articles about three Disco Elysium spiritual successors - each <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">more</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">politically</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">outspoken</a> than the last, in a kind of Sophisticated Pooh collage of escalating Marxism - I like to kick back with a nice chill game about Lovecraftian space monsters. </p>
<p>That game is Konafa Game's Starless Abyss - a roguelite tactical deckbuilder published by Descenders and Yes, Your Grace outfit No More Robots. It puts you in command of a fleet of upgradeable spaceships, who must chase away invading Eldritch aliens hex by hex... and also, hex by hex. This is both hex-based and a game in which you can cast hexes, you see. Oh, don't look at me like that. I had to distil several manifestos into an article half-an-hour ago. I need this.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Starless Abyss you play a Proxima, the possibly-human agent of a motley crew of scientists and occultists called Counter Horror. There are five Proximas in all, each with different skills and attributes. There are over 160 cards to discover, divided between six faction groupings, and each campaign run spans three acts with several randomly selected bosses. Visually, it's a writhing pixelart buffet of toothy tentacles and flying eyeballs and spacetime rifts, set to menacing chipset. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's a touch more detail on how you'll and expand and tune up your fleet. This being a labour of Lovecraft, it's of no huge surprise to learn that you can prevail over the monsters by driving yourself absolutely mad.</p>
<blockquote><p>Start your run playing 'Lucid Proxima' and command a fleet of ships through battle across the universe. Successful missions reward you with new artifacts to upgrade your ships, D.I.C.E to help sway pivotal moments between missions or cards from different factions, which can be collected, combined and combo-ed to help destroy the eldritch beasts. Beware though! The closer you get to the ultimate Outer Gods, the more your Proxima's sanity depletes. Or embrace your insanity and harness the power of the occult using annihilating Ritual Cards to take down your opposition. </p></blockquote>
<p>It's out in 2025 - here's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/">the Steam page with more</a>. I'm kind of burned out on sci-fi deckbuilders after Breachway, but as a Homeworld: Cataclysm cultist, I do like me some cosmic body horror in space. If you like the cut of these screaming entrails, may I also recommend <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2169930/Rtype_Tactics_I_o_II_Cosmos/">R-Type Tactics</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s the makeup of the studio as it stands today, October 11, with more people said to be coming on board in the coming weeks.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina, who were among the five writers of Disco Elysium</li><li>Lenval Brown, a voice actor known for his voice work on Disco Elysium</li><li>Dora Klindžić, who was a principal writer in ZA/UM</li><li>Anastasia Ivanova, who was a senior concept artist in ZA/UM</li><li>Michael Oswell, who was the graphic designer at ZA/UM</li><li>And Aleksandar Gavrilović, who was the managing director of game developer studio Gamechuck</li></ul><p>It’s worth noting that neither Robert Kurvitz, the lead writer and designer of Disco Elysium and founding member of ZA/UM, nor Aleksander Rostov, who was art director on Disco Elysium, are currently involved with either Summer Eternal, Dark Math Games, Longdue Games, Red Info (see below), or ZA/UM itself. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-developers-involuntarily-left-zaum-responds"><u>Both were fired from ZA/UM</u></a> in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct, and are now reportedly making a new game of their own at a studio called Red Info, which is backed by Chinese internet company NetEase.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves...</p></div><p>“We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising ‘the next Disco Elysium’ are popping up every hour on the hour,” read a statement from Summer Eternal.</p><p>“It’s a sure sign that the fifth anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.</p><p>“However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused… But it is all of us – the creatives, the workers, the players – who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day.</p><p>“Therefore, we announce today our own vision of a worker-owned co-operative, a complex structure that will ensure that not only moneylenders but every worker, every creative, even every player, has a seat at the table.”</p><p>Summer Eternal has opened the doors to its <a href="https://summereternal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, which contains a manifesto for game development that wouldn’t be out of place in Disco Elysium itself and word of an incoming crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>“I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking,” Tuulik said. “Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that. The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged — for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind — let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops.</p></div><p>That choice quote above is a reference to ZA/UM’s high-profile collapse following the release of Disco Elysium back in 2019. Some background for the uninitiated: Disco Elysium is a narrative role-playing game developed and published by controversial studio ZA/UM. Gameplay revolves around navigating dialogue trees rather than combat, with each of the 24 skills representing a different aspect of the amnesiac detective protagonist's abilities and thoughts. The player is free to support or suppress his ideologies as they work through the story. Disco Elysium is considered by some among the greatest video games ever made.</p><p>It went on to enjoy enormous success, winning numerous game of the year awards and selling millions of copies. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disco-elysium-tv-adaptation-announced-from-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-producer"><u>TV series adaptation deal</u></a> followed, as did the release of an expanded version of the game featuring full voice acting and new content subtitled The Final Cut. A follow-up seemed all but guaranteed, but after high-profile staff exits and subsequent messy legal tussles brought ZA/UM to its knees, what might have turned out to be a Disco Elysium sequel was canceled.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>XXX NIGHTSHIFT Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Fast forward to today, October 11, 2024, and the cusp of Disco Elysium’s five-year anniversary, and we now have multiple spin-off studios laying claim to the spiritual successor throne. One of these, Dark Math Games' XXX NIGHTSHIFT, is a 'true detective RPG' that looks remarkably similar to Disco Elysium, even down to the isometric perspective and dialogue text that moves up the right-hand side of the screen as the player makes choices and hears voice actors bring a narrator and the protagonist’s internal monologue to life.</p><p>When asked how he felt about this rapid-fire emergence of new Disco Elysium spin-off studios all saying they're making spiritual successors, Tuulik told IGN: “You know the scene from Lord of the Rings, where Arwen is taking Frodo to Rivendell with the ringwraiths giving chase horseback and right before the river scene you finally see all nine ride together to stop Frodo? It's kind of like that.”</p><p>So what, exactly, is Summer Eternal building? Tuulik says it has a complex structure involving co-operatives with not only full time workers but also freelancers and part-time collaborators, and even a player-ownership of a game studio aspect. It will take some time to set up, he said. There are no assets for the video game Summer Eternal is working on, but Tuulik did tell IGN about it in vague terms. In short, it's "definitely not a Disco Elysium sequel," but it will be a role-playing game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/screenshot-2024-10-11-151300-1728656077537.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Summer Eternal's website presents visits with a clip of a prairie fire. Image credit: Summer Eternal.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"What I can say is that here in Summer Eternal we share a belief that role-playing games are the pinnacle expression of current human culture - something every other discipline can contribute," Tuulik said. "Art-form of the century. And we have found a way to combine role-playing with serious, funny, moving, narratives in a way that allows us artists to express ourselves in a unprecedented way. When one day I'll come to you with news of something, it will be a role-playing game."</p><p>"It will definitely not be a Disco Elysium sequel!" Tuulik continued. "It is time to break away from the past and start a new chapter. It will be a completely new setting and story with new mechanics. But end of the day we are who we are and RPGs are what we will make - do what you will with it :)"</p><p>Tuulik even had a message for his former colleagues (“comrades”) at ZA/UM, including Kurvitz and Rostov:</p><p>“To all other former respected comrades (Kurvitz, Rostov, everyone) – long time no hear, but we would love for you to join the struggle as well: time to roll up our sleeves and start building communism!”</p><p>As for ZA/UM, it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaum-reportedly-cancels-disco-elysium-expansion-at-risk-of-lay-offs"><u>reportedly canceled a standalone expansion for Disco Elysium back in February</u></a>, leaving several staff members at risk of losing their jobs.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In case you skipped the Guardian Games earlier this year and never got one, these will be available at the squid-faced merchant's store.

It comes in handy during dangerous moments, but the stats here are quite low almost across the board. Intellect and mobility get most of the available stat points, but you'll have some big gaps in your defense if you decide to roll with this particular version of the helmet.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 13</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 8</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Helm of Saint-14 (Exotic Titan helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383242"></a><figcaption>Helm of Saint-14</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383242-destiny22024-10-1119-05-29.jpg"></figure><p>For the Titan who likes to be the best line of defense, Helm of Saint-14 is great. If you have your Ward of Dawn Super active, enemies who enter it will be blinded, while allies who pass through it get a weapon damage boost. If you use the Sentinel Shield Super, guarding with this ability will blind nearby targets. The stats on this roll emphasize building around your Super, as you get great resilience and intellect alongside a solid recovery stat. Strength and discipline are a bit low on this Exotic, so you'll need to use some armor mods to bring them up to speed, but mobility is thankfully minimized for a Titan.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Discipline: 9</li><li dir="ltr">Intellect: 15</li><li dir="ltr">Strength: 6</li><li dir="ltr">Total: 62</li></ul><h3>Felwinter's Helm (Exotic Warlock helmet)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383243" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383243"></a><figcaption>Felwinter's Helm</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383243-destiny22024-10-1119-05-43.jpg"></figure><p>Powered melee finals will create a burst of energy that weakens enemies when you equip the Felwinter's Helm Exotic. Finishers and final blows against powerful targets also increase the size of the burst and the weakening effect, so this is an interesting Exotic to build around if you're looking to get up close and personal with enemies. The stats are another story, as this Exotic has terrible strength and recovery numbers. Intellect is pretty good, but mobility is unnecessarily high for a Warlock and recovery is almost non-existent. With the right build, Felwinter's Helm is pretty powerful, but feel free to give this version of the Exotic a skip this week.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 19</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 10</li><li

Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <p>
Ahead of new California legislation requiring storefronts to make it clear customers are only buying a license for digital content rather than outright owning it, Steam has implemented a message at the point of purchase doing just that.
</p>
<p>
California's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/buying-digital-games-means-youre-just-purchasing-a-license-california-will-force-storefronts-to-admit">new legislation</a>, which was signed into law by governor Gavin Newsom at the end of September, is intended to make consumers more aware of the sometimes-temporary nature of digital ownership. It explicitly prohibits sellers from using the words "buy, purchase, or any other term which a reasonable person would understand to confer an unrestricted ownership interest in the digital good" - instead requiring them to display a "clear and conspicuous statement" explaining the nature of their transaction.
</p>
<p>
And while the legislation, officially known as <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426">AB 2426</a>, doesn't formally comes into effect until next year, Valve has already tweaked Steam's shopping cart to highlight customers are buying a license - with the changes being displayed internationally, including in the UK. Steam's shopping cart now features a short message below the 'Continue to payment' button, reading, "A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam." That's followed by a link to the Steam Subscriber Agreement, containing additional information.

<p>
California's new legislation doesn't apply to games offered as part of a subscription service, to games "sold" or given away for free, or to games that can be downloaded and played permanently offline. That hasn't stopped GOG, a storefront known for its commitment to DRM-free games, from getting a bit cheeky in light of Steam's changes.
</p><p>
"Since checkout banners are trending," the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">post on social media</a>, "we're thinking of putting one up ourselves." It included a GOG shopping cart mockup appended with a new message of its own: "A purchase of a digital product on GOG grants you its Offline Installers, <strong>which cannot be taken away from you</strong>."

Legislation AB 2426 follows several high profile instances of games being yanked from owners' libraries in recent times. Ubisoft made headlines earlier this year after it began <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">quietly revoking players' licenses to The Crew</a>, and PlayStation opted to withdraw access to PS5 shooter Concord (albeit while providing refunds) after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">announcing it was shutting servers down</a>.
</p>
<p>
The controversy caused by Ubisoft's decision in particular led to revitalised discourse around video games preservation, and the establishment of Stop Killing Games - an initiative aiming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-aims-to-mount-political-and-legal-challenges-to-games-going-offline">mount political and legal challenges</a> to the increasingly common occurrence of purchased games becoming unplayable. And while legislation such as AB 2426 doesn't fix the issue at its root, it does at least seek to better inform consumers ahead of a purchase.

The shop updates with new items as you increase your player level, and that includes new characters. <strong>Every unlockable fighter should be in the shop once you’ve reached Player Level 20</strong>.</p><p>One of the quickest ways to increase your player level is to wish for it when using a Shenron summon. This boosted me up to level 8 and updated the Shop quite a bit. You can also wish this with a Super Shenron Summon for an even bigger boost, but there’s arguably a better use for that dragon that I’ll be going over soon.</p><p>I also want to reiterate that although you can just buy them all in the shop, there’s always an alternative. Aside from the eventual DLC characters and Goku (Mini), the latter of whom is exclusive to the pre-order pack, you can unlock everyone through other means.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-recommend-id="image://3200dbf9720c044b2d47100c8ed50347" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A results screen after clearing the Saiyan Arc Chapter in Episode Battles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you don’t want to grind out money for the shop, your next best option is to unlock them through the Episode Battles. That’s right,<strong> you can acquire a bunch of these fighters for free just by playing through <em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</em>’s version of story mode.</strong><br></p><p>This is certainly the most efficient method to get more characters. You’ll unlock them naturally as you progress through the story, all the while increasing your player level and earning Zeni to use at the shop for even more characters. Unless there’s someone you immediately want to unlock and use, I suggest getting most of your roster this way.

That can only mean one thing: It’s October, the spookiest month of the year. And soon Halloween will arrive and, as in past years, that means creepy characters, horror icons, and other villainous baddies will be arriving in <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1844747650731479348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On October 11</a></span>, Epic posted a new trailer for Fortnightmares 2024, showing off some of the new skins, locations, and items that will be a part of this year’s spooky event. Here’s the trailer: </p><p>Some of the characters in the new trailer, which leaked earlier today, had previously been datamined and reported on before the official reveal. For example, we knew Leatherface and Billy The Puppet (from the <em>Saw </em>movies) were coming to <em>Fortnite </em>as Epic had teased them before and leaks had indicated such earlier this month. </p><p>However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844654208730943909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edward Scissorhands</a></span> was a surprise. The eponymous star of Tim Burton’s classic 1990 film is seen briefly in the trailer carving some ice, indicating that they will be available to buy and play as in the update. </p><p>Also new this year are the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1844643370141979053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playable chainsaw</a></span>s. These appear to be melee weapons that can also be used as pseudo-vehicles by carving into the ground and scooting around at high speed. The chainsaws will go perfectly with this year’s new Leatherface skin. <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> killer loves a good automated chain with saw blades. </p><p>This trailer also gives us our first real look at three Disney villains appearing in <em>Fortnite</em>: Cruella DeVille, Captain Hook, and Maleficent.

The law comes as questions have arisen in recent years regarding what "ownership" means in a world increasingly dominated by digital products.</p><p>"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," California Assembly member Jacqui Irwin said <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>.</p><p>California's law is set to go into effect in 2025, but it appears Steam is getting ahead of it by issuing the disclaimer now. Presumably other digital storefronts for games will follow at some point in the future.</p><p>The new law aims to help consumers better understand how digital licenses operate--but it doesn't prevent companies from yanking access to content people already purchased. For example, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed The Crew from players' libraries</a> after the servers shut down.</p><p>Developers often close servers for older games as player populations fall, but it's less common for games to be removed from libraries entirely.

It was a free game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4s-with-pre-installed-pt-listed-on-ebay-for-as-m/1100-6426971/" data-ref-id="1100-6426971">some believed they'd be able to play it forever. </a></p>

        <p>With a worker's co-operative structure that includes a "voice of the gamers"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">two</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">other</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> "spiritual successors" you read about today were but filthy pretenders, or at best, the thesis and antithesis resulting in this afternoon's triumphant synthesis.* The <em>real</em> Disco Elysium spiritual successor is whatever they're making at Summer Eternal, a just-announced "art collective/RPG studio" founded by a group of, once more with feeling, former Disco Elysium developers.</p>
<p>The press release for this particular Disco Elysiulike has the most actual names on it of the three we've learned about this week. It is also, by some distance, the most outwardly socialist of the lot. It accompanies a website, featuring some blood-red all-caps political manifestos and a fairly exhaustive breakdown of Summer Eternal's workers cooperative structure. Amongst other things, the studio will let people who buy their games form a non-profit within Summer Eternal that gets a share of the revenue, and has a say on company direction.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The former Disco Elysium devs in question are writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina. They're joined by several other ZA/UM alumni: former principal writer Dora Klindžić, former senior concept artist Anastasia Ivanova, and former graphic designer Michael Oswell. Confirmed as not involved are former Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov, who aren't involved with at least one of the other "spiritual successor" studios either.</p>
<p>Summer Eternal don't have a named game project yet. Rather, they're currently looking "to gather authors, writers, designers who previously worked together on Disco Elysium, as well as new talent, all of us who have yearned to work together on something completely fresh and original, and create a liberating space for us and other veteran RPG developers to finally, after many years, collectively start innovating again in this game space". 
</p><p>
Whatever their eventual RPG project proves to be, Summer Eternal are broadly aiming to do what they feel Disco Elysium did, and smash all precedents to pieces. "I believe that the last time around we made something genre-breaking," writes Argo Tuulik on <a href="https://summereternal.com/">the studio's site</a> (which, let me tell you, was <em>really hard to read and digest at short notice</em>). "Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that.</p>
<p>"The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged - for five fucking years I've been waiting to put them to use," he continues. "So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind - let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad."
</p>
<p>
The website has a blogpost about Summer Eternal's internal structure written by Aleksandar Gavrilović, who is also managing director of Gamechuck. It begins by outlining how Summer Eternal will compromise with capitalism's many vultures, while pursuing their own vision for a socialist co-op. "The dream is simple to explain: create games, push boundaries, and reinvest the fruits of our artistic labour back into the creation of more art, the thing we are alive for on this earth," Gavrilović writes. "However, to be able to work on games, these labour intensive works of art, we need capital, in droves. 
</p>
<p>
"On the one hand, private capital (sometimes in the cloak of "patrons of the arts") has been the preferred shortcut to funding the riskier segment of the arts," he continues. "On the other hand, capital will always prioritise profit over sustainability and artistic expression, leading to various budgetary and creative conflicts. Thus, the question of organisation becomes a question of the balance of power in this dangerous dance."</p><p>Long story short: Summer Eternal plan to open a shareholding company on 1st April 2025, which will distribute shares between four entities within the studio - each with the power to call assemblies and vote on policy, and each with its own revenue-share model. The full-time creative team for their first game will get 50% of the shares, "managed equally" among co-op members, rather than distributed individually. Workers who aren't part of the above "creative co-op of full-time workers", such as outsourcers, will get 25% of shares, distributed according to a structure that permits "capital returns by a system of individual capital accounts".  
</p>
<p>
A further 20% of shares will go to a limited liability company for investors: once Summer Eternal's game is released, this LLC will have a revenue-share model, similar to standard publishing contracts. And the final 5% of shares? That'll go to a non-profit organisation that accepts membership from people who buy Summer Eternal's games. This in-house "voice of the gamers" will be able to use its share of revenues "to organise events, support union-work, or whatever their assembly (comprised of all members) decides on", in addition to being able to summon general assemblies with the other three groups to discuss Summer Eternal's direction.
</p>
<p>
In case you missed this morning's write-ups, Summer Eternal's founders have had their thunder stolen by two other, just-revealed Disco Elys'um ups - Longdue's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">untitled "psychogeography RPG"</a> and Dark Math's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>. The press release makes bracingly salty mention of this. It suggests that one or both of the other, would-be claimants to the Disco throne are just corporate parasites attempting to cash in on the legacy.</p>
<p>"We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising 'the next Disco Elysium' are popping up every hour on the hour," it comments. "It's a sure sign that the 5th anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.
</p><p>
"However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalized for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused..."  it goes on. "But it is all of us - the creatives, the workers, the players - who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day."</p>
<p>The part about mistreating creatives may also refer to the bitter battle between ZA/UM studio management and key staff like Kurvitz and writer Helen Hindpere after Disco Elysium's release. Nic has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">a summary for you here</a>. And with that, I am officially calling a moratorium on Disco Elysium spiritual successors until next week at least.</p>

Given how people hate being surprised by romance, whether because they’re forced into a relationship or accidentally stumble into one, you should know <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> does have some romantic storylines that sneak up on you.</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For much of its run, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a pretty sexless game. Most of its relationships are platonic and built upon a shared cause, learning its many fantasy cultures, or helping folks through political turmoil. But there’s not a lot of smooching. In fact, I’m having trouble remembering if there are any scenes in <em>Metaphor</em> in which lips are locked. But that doesn’t mean love can’t bloom— whether you like it or not.<br></p><p>There are two follower bonds that gesture toward romantic interest between your protagonist and the woman involved. Junah, the songstress companion you’ll recruit around midway through the game, and Eupha, the summoner who you’ll meet shortly after. Junah’s is mostly flirtatious, whereas Eupha’s has a full-blown confession of love (albeit couched in the lore and culture of her people, the Mustari). To be clear, you don’t have to play into either relationship if that’s not how you want to roleplay. However, Eupha’s story specifically did end in a way that felt more forced, with an interaction between me and her protective brother nudging my protagonist as if there was a budding flame between me and the summoner despite my not leaning into it earlier in the game. Again, I played dumb to the best of my ability, having headcanoned that my hero had been holding a crush for the swordsman Strohl the whole game, but it does seem like <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a relationship in mind, and doesn’t let you outright turn it down. You can still headcanon this as an awkward interaction with her brother who knows Eupha has feelings for you, whether you’ve reciprocated or not. But the implication remains.</p><p>If you don’t want to mess with that at all, you could always just not finish Eupha’s follower bond. This was how many people handled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-romance-social-yukari-mitsuru-fuuka-1851206843"><em>Persona 3</em>’s relationships</a></span> when the original game wouldn’t let you finish any social links with female characters without entering a romantic relationship with them. It’s not as overt as those, but it does harken back to that same weirdness that I thought we’d gotten past. Suppose you wanted to make Eupha or Junah the canon love interest, would it not have been easier to codify it somehow in the story, not shove it into optional relationships that can take a player by surprise? Do with this information what you will, I just didn’t want everyone to be ambushed by an unexpected romance like I was if they didn’t have to be.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-now-shows-that-you-dont-actually-own-the-game-youre-buying/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The next time you buy a game on Steam, it’ll be clear that you won’t actually be buying the game. A recent update on Steam now shows players that instead of buying a game, all they are purchasing is a license.</p>



<p>“A purchase of a digital product grants a license for the product on Steam,” the message reads along with a link to Steam’s subscriber agreement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The update comes just after <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California signed a bill into law</a> that requires digital storefronts to clearly state when media being purchased  is only a license to access. The new law applies to all digital works such as music, movies, TV shows, ebooks, and video games.</p>



<p>“As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important,” California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin said in a release at the time via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>. “I thank the Governor for signing AB 2426, ensuring the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past.”</p>



<p>The law goes into effect in 2025. </p>



<p>As of writing, Steam is the only storefront to show this disclaimer. Neither the Xbox Store, nor PlayStation Store, nor Epic Games Store display this same notice when going to purchase a game from the stores. It’s unclear when that update will come, but it should be expected to happened.</p>



<p>What do you think of Steam telling players that the game they are buying is just a license and doesn’t constitute ownership? Let us know below or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Melee.</h2></div><section><p>In one of his final videos as part of the "Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" YouTube series, Smash Bros. Masahiro creator offered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2wYKkqhkG0&amp;t=94s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">touching tribute to his friend and former boss Satoru Iwata</a>, who served as Nintendo president from 2002 until his death in 2015.</p><p>"It wouldn't be right to end this channel without touching on this topic," Sakurai wrote on X/Twitter.</p><p>Sakurai, who opened the channel to talk about his experiences developing games, worked with Iwata at HAL Laboratory before the latter moved to Nintendo in 2000 as the head of corporate planning. Sakurai shares several touching memories over the course of the 10 minute video, including their first job interview, how Iwata helped come up with the title of Super Smash Bros., and the last time they saw one another.</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light">— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1844695310091841666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While Iwata's management role typically kept him far away from development, he nevertheless played a key role in Smash Bros. Melee's development by contributing his expertise as a programmer and solving numerous bugs. Sakurai also remembers how Iwata came up with the "brothers" part of Super Smash Bros., which was meant to convey that the characters weren't actually fighting, but friends solving a little disagreement.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best</p></div><p>Sakurai goes on to recall his shock at Iwata succeeding Hiroshi Yamauchi as Nintendo president, calling it "frankly unimaginable" that a comparative outsider should take over what had been a family-owned business for generations after just two years with the company. Nevertheless, he said, Iwata proved to be a major force at Nintendo, contributing numerous ideas such as the Iwata Asks series, the concept of the Nintendo Direct, and more.</p><p>Sakurai finishes by remembering their final drive together, and how they had planned to meet again later that year before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/nintendo-ceo-satoru-iwata-has-passed-away">Iwata suddenly passed away in July</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/mr-iwata-grab-bag-youtube-0-8-36-1728659112340.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Masahiro Sakurai recalls the last time he saw Satoru Iwata. Image source: Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"Mr. Iwata was truly the person who understood me best," Sakurai said. "He was full of virtue, relentlessly hardworking, committed to service, and a man who changed the games industry. If I hadn't met Mr. Iwata at the start of my career, I'd probably be off doing something completely different." </p><p>Iwata's influence continues to be felt in games even now, close to a decade after his death. Just this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo released Alarmo</a>, an idea that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-has-a-fascinating-connection-to-late-nintendo-president-satoru-iwata">near and dear to Iwata's heart</a>. An Echoes of Wisdom easter egg also seemingly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/reggie-incredibly-touched-by-apparent-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reference-to-friendship-with-satoru-iwata">paid tribute to his friendship with former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé</a>, </p><p>Sakurai's tribute to Iwata is one of his final videos as he winds down his YouTube channel, which started in 2022 and has 589,000 subscribers. He says that he continues to make games for the time being, but his next project is currently unknown.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Almost everything connected to The Witcher reflects the dark fantasy and mature themes of that series, but for anyone looking for a more lighthearted adventure starring Geralt of Rivia, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593235452?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this new book looks delightful</a>.

The Little Witcher will be published by Random House Worlds on May 13, 2025, and is available to preorder at Amazon for $16.</p><h2>The Little Witcher</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383158-little-witcher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383158" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383158-little-witcher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383158"></a><figcaption>The Little Witcher</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383158-little-witcher.jpg"></figure><p>Between slaying deadly beasts and taking on dangerous contracts, he's also trying to raise young Ciri and teach her what it means to be a witcher. "Young Ciri's extensive training at Kaer Morhen, the witchers' stronghold, includes everything she needs to learn to survive the many threats in her world --as well as all the antics and fun of a little girl bonding with her adoptive dad and family," the official synopsis reads.</p><p>"With help from Geralt and Ciri's closest companions--including the motherly magic of Yennefer of Vengerberg and the wisdom of uncle Vesemir--these adorable tales of a non-traditional family will make you laugh, make you sigh, and make you realize that raising a Little Witcher is not that different from raising any other kid."</p><hr><h2><span>The Witcher Graphic Novels, Based on the Games</span></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383171-witcher-omnibus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383171" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383171-witcher-omnibus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4383171"></a><figcaption>The Witcher Omnibus Volume 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4383171-witcher-omnibus.jpg"></figure><p>While it will be a bit of a wait to get The Little Witcher--reminder, you'll only be charged when it ships, not when you preorder it--you can grab plenty of other Witcher comics right now.
