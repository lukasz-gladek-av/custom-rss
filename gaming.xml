<p>Recently, we reported about the issues that Guild Esports is facing, with financial turmoil running rampant through the London-based organisation that’s backed by David Beckham. It was highlighted that with cash reserves dwindling, the organisation had just £25,000 on hand, and the stock value of the company was plummeting.</p>



<p>Now, in a report shared by Reuters, it has been confirmed that Guild Esports is ‘planning to agree’ to a takeover bid from DCB Sports, a Californian investment firm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-stay-afloat">To Stay Afloat</h2>



<p>It was highlighted in the report <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/david-beckham-backed-guild-esports-set-takeover-by-us-based-dcb-sports-2024-08-05/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Reuters</a> that Guild Esports’ stock value has crashed by around 99% since the all-time high was reached in 2020. In a recent all-time low, the share price of Guild Esports touched around $0.08. </p>



<p>In a statement, Guild’s representatives said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Should the transaction complete, DCB Sports will assume and run the Guild brand, backstop future working capital requirements for the private business, provide ongoing capital sufficient to allow it to operate on a stable financial platform.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’ll be a complete buyout, with DCB Sports assuming control of everything – and that means the full suite of successes and failures currently sitting under the Guild banner.</p>



<p>Guild has experimented with several esports games in the past, ranging from top-tier titles like VALORANT and Counter-Strike to more emerging markets like simracing. Currently, the organisation fields teams in the likes of Fortnite, EA Sports FC, Street Fighter, and Apex Legends.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mike-ybarra-ceo-role/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mike-ybarra-microsoft-and-blizzard-veteran-takes-up-ceo-role-at-fantasy-sports-firm.945291/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mike-ybarra-ceo-role/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In January, Mike Ybarra left his role as President of Blizzard Entertainment after more than two decades at Microsoft. It came around the time that the tech titan made almost 2,000 layoffs, furthering the damage done to the industry in one of the toughest years on record for redundancies and studio closures.</p>



<p>Now, the veteran who worked in and around Microsoft’s gaming branches since 2009 has announced an entirely new role – CEO of PrizePicks, a ‘skill-based fantasy sports operator’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-still-gaming-in-a-way">Still Gaming, In a Way</h2>



<p>In the words of Matt Booty, Mike Ybarra ‘saw through’ Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard before departing the company. For almost three years, Ybarra sat at the top of the table at Blizzard Entertainment, and before that, he had a hand in managing the strategy driving Xbox Live, Xbox Game Pass, and the failed ‘Mixer’ streaming platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7226287019151257602/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On LinkedIn</a>, Mike Ybarra posted a comment about his new role at PrizePicks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m impressed with the talent and capability at PrizePicks. I’m very excited to join this amazing team and build on our great products and business together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PrizePicks explained that Ybarra is ‘closely aligned with the PrizePicks culture, bringing an unwavering focus on fan experience and constant innovation.’ He is also joining the firm’s board of directors. </p>



<p>The company, which has a focus on operating a fantasy sports market in North America, is an app-based solution that’s headquartered in Atlanta. It’s a platform that offers users the opportunity to make money with a wide range of fantasy sports leagues, including the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB. It also offers a relatively unique esports fantasy product centred around CS2, Call of Duty, and VALORANT, among other games, which is a comfortable enough connection for Mike Ybarra.</p>

		<p>HBO’s massive hit, The Last of Us, based on the PlayStation games of the same name is heading towards Season 2 which will launch sometime in 2025.</p>
<p>The new trailer gives us hints of what is to come with some shots mirroring scenes from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/12/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4-tlou2/">The Last of Us Part 2</a> such as the Barn Dance in Jackson. The voice overs also suggest that some of the plot will of the tv show will also follow Part 2 of the game. However there are also new scenes such as Joel and Ellie in a wrecked train which could suggest not every plot point will be followed – I think you know the one I am talking about. There again the Joel scenes could be flashbacks, who knows.</p>


<p>We do know that Season 2 of the show will not include the full story of Part 2, the plan is for more than two seasons and to break up the story from the video game. This was revealed by co-creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/the-last-of-us-finale-ending-explained-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GQ</a>. When asked if <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/27/the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-sky/">The Last of Us season 2</a> would feature the entirety of the second game, Mazin said, “No. No way.” Druckmann added, “It’s more than one season”.</p>
<p>Would that mean a full run of three seasons or even four? Mazin said, “You have noted correctly that we will not say how many. But more than one is factually correct.”</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last of Us Season 2 | Official Trailer | Max" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/48WJNnNefvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kaitlyn Dever will be playing Abby with Pedro Pascal returning as Joel, joined by Bella Ramsey’s Ellie. The cast also includes Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse, Jeffrey Wright as Isaac, and Ariela Barer as Mel.</p>

<p>Neil Druckmann has confirmed that while&nbsp; The Last of Us 3 may not be in active development, he has a concept for the game that could tie the trilogy together. He admitted that for years he hadn’t been able to find that concept, “but recently that’s changed.”</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t have a story, but I do have that concept. That, to me, is as exciting as one, as exciting as two, is its own thing, yet has this through line for all 3. So it does feel like… there’s probably one more chapter to this story.</p></blockquote>

With just a couple of weeks to go until the release of Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed">shared a post-launch content roadmap</a> which, among other things, confirms Lando Calrissian and Hondo Ohnaka will appears as part of the game's paid Season Pass.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws launches on 30th August, and owners of its Season Pass - which comes bundled into the game's £95 Gold Edition and £115 Ultimate Edition - immediately gain access to the Vessel Runner Character Pack (also a pre-order bonus), containing cosmetics for protagonist Kay and companion Nix, plus the exclusive Jabba’s Gambit mission.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft moved to assure players Jabba the Hutt would also make an appear in Outlaws' base game earlier this year, after fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-pricey-extra-jabba-the-hutt-mission-is-optional-and-additional-ubisoft-says">grew concerned</a> one of Star Wars' most iconic villains would be locked behind a paid season pass. Lando Calrissian and Hondo Ohnaka's newly confirmed inclusion in Outlaws' Season Pass may prove similarly controversial, especially as Ubisoft is yet to confirm whether they star in the base game too.

<p>
Lando Calrissian appears in Outlaws' first major bit of DLC - Story Pack 1, AKA Wild Card - which is scheduled to release this autumn. "Kay is hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament," explains Ubisoft, "but as she crosses paths with the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian, she soon learns that another game is being played." Story Pack 1 arrives alongside two additional cosmetics bundles - Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin - which will also be part of the Season Pass.
</p>
<p>
As for Hondo Ohnaka, he appears in a second Story Pack - titled A Pirate's Fortune - in the spring of 2025. "The Trailblazer’s reputation precedes Kay as she runs into veteran pirate Hondo Ohnaka, " goes the official description, "who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates."

Ian Higton, though, was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-being-a-blatant-mix-of-all-things-ubisoft-star-wars-outlaws-feels-like-a-proper-star-wars-adventure">little more positive</a> after four hours of playtime in July, writing, "If you're after a familiar, inoffensive bit of Star Wars, I don't think this one will miss the mark."
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Outlaws will be available for PC (via Epic and the Ubisoft Store), PlayStaion 5, and Xbox Series X/S when it launches on 30th August.

<p>He said it was going to happen, and then it did. Adin Ross has just completed a short live stream with presidential candidate Donald Trump, and during the stream, he exceeded a live viewer count of <strong>half a million </strong>users on Kick. It smashed his previous record which was set during an interview with ‘Kim Jong Un’ that turned out to be with an impersonator – which is why people were sceptical going into this stream.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-man-himself">The Man Himself</h2>



<p>True enough, Adin Ross just spent an hour and a half conversing with Donald Trump. During the stream, the controversial creator gifted the potential president (again) a Tesla Cybertruck wrapped in an image of Trump surviving his assassination attempt set against an American flag, as well as a Rolex.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://kick.com/video/6304d49a-a6ef-47df-a2b3-40fb5d7c5462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the stream unfolded</a>, the duo talked about everything from the war in Ukraine to the political future of the United States, all while a whopping 589,000 concurrent viewers tuned in.</p>



<p>It turned a little bizarre at the end, with xQc showing up wearing a t-shirt of Donald Trump all grilled up, but that’s par for the course from Felix.</p>



<p>Later this year, Donald Trump hopes to find success in his political campaign, securing a second term of presidency in the United States at 78 years of age. His key opponent, Joe Biden, just dropped out, leaving Kamala Harris to run in his stead. </p>

			<p>This coming Thursday, QuakeCon 2024 officially kicks off, returning to the Gaylord Texan Resort and Convention Center in Grapevine, Texas. This event is being kicked off with the BYOC (Bring-Your-Own-Computer) LAN party, as well as plenty of livestreams for fans to get stuck into.</p>
<p>The BYOC event is sold out, so fans won't be able to participate in that event unless they have a ticket. However, livestreams from QuakeCon will kick off on August 8 at 3 PM PT / 4 PM ET / 11 PM BST. The livestreams will kick off with a message from id Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin. This message will give fans a programming schedule so that they know what to expect throughout the livestream. Along with the programming schedule, there will also be a couple of special announcements from id Software.</p>
<p>Fans can expect to see a livestream of The Elder Scrolls Online Trial Run, as well as a Fallout 76 Camp judging stream. Those who are interested to watch the stream can find them on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's official Twitch channel</a>. All of the livestream schedules are available on the QuakeCon website.</p>
<p><strong>The stream schedule for August 8 is as follows (all times are CT):</strong></p>
<p>3 PM: Welcome to QuakeCon 2024</p>
<p>3:30 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part one</p>

<p><strong>August 9 schedule is as follows:</strong></p>

<p>3 PM: Slayers Club live with id Software part IV</p>
<p>4 PM: Fallout Summer C.A.M.P. contest</p>
<p>5 PM: Quakecon Dirty Keyboard contest - in partnership with Steelseries</p>
<p>QuakeCon will last four days in total, with plenty of on-site activities for fans to participate in. These activities include the BYOC community tournaments, a Tabletop Village and Free2Play Arcades. For those who purchased general admission tickets, you won't be able to participate in the BYOC events, but you will be able to participate in the rest of what QuakeCon has to offer. The general admission tickets grant people access to the Convention Center from 8 AM CT through to 1 AM CT.</p>
<p>Like previous years, Dallas Pets Alive will be returning to QuakeCon, where people can experience the Kitten AFK room and puppy streams. They will also be selling their popular custom t-shirts which can be found online and onsite.</p>
<p>This year, QuakeCon will be supporting multiple charities. This includes InfluentiALS Foundation, 1Up Cancer, Gamers Outreach and an onsite blood drive for the American Red Cross.</p>
<p>If you are unable to attend QuakeCon in person but still want to reap the benefits of the event, there will be a sale on all platforms for <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-files-trademark-for-new-id-tech-powered-ip-motor/">Bethesda</a>'s games, allowing fans to get discounts on some of the games that they may have been eyeing up for a little while.</p>
<p>QuakeCon 2024 is looking to be jam packed this year, with people even getting the opportunity to win some goodies from SteelSeries in the Dirty Keyboard contest.</p>

It can be found as an item in the player’s inventory. <strong>The hammer is capable of holding five total charges, which can be earned back by completing Echoes activities such as Breach Executable and Nessus Battlegrounds</strong>. The hammer can only be used during these missions.</p><h2 id="h7238"><a id=""></a>Where to use the Planetary Piston Hammer</h2><p>Places where you can use the Planetary Piston Hammer are pretty abundant. You’re looking for a white column reminiscent of Vex structures that have been seen throughout the series with a bronze base. As you move through one of the new Battlegrounds or the Breach Executable activity, <strong>these points will be marked as a starred objective</strong> rather than a standard white diamond which typically points you towards a goal. There are at least two columns where you can use the hammer per mission.</p><p>When you approach these columns, you’re going to want to hold the interact button over them and use one of your charges. Your character will slam their hammer into the base of the column, causing an abundance of samples to spawn in your immediate area. Don’t worry about racing other players to grab them, as <strong>everybody in the current activity earns all resources regardless of who does the collecting</strong>. This is a surefire way to burn through most of the objectives in the “Echoes” storyline, “A Rising Chorus,” since you often have to collect enough samples to bring back to Failsafe.</p><p>By regularly using the Planetary Piston Hammer, you’re not only ensuring that you get a ton of samples, but you’re also using a charge that will inevitably be refilled by engaging in an “Echoes” activity. If you don’t use them, you’ll still be able to find samples around the levels, but the rewards are drastically diminished. Moreover, beyond pushing the story along, you can continue to collect radiolite samples and dump them into the radiolite bay in the H.E.L.M. to keep earning “Echoes” loot.</p><p><strong>If you deposit two or three times the required number of samples, you can even earn better gear, including Exotics</strong>. Spamming the Planetary Piston Hammer in “Echoes” activities is arguably one of the faster ways to level up at a quicker pace and take on endgame content. In short, use them! Otherwise, you’re just sitting on a proverbial gold mine when you could be flush with better gear.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s where things seem to stand based on that:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Aegon the Conqueror (live action)</li><li>Ten Thousand Ships (live action)</li><li>Mystery Live Action 1 <br></li><li>The Golden Empire (animated)</li><li>Sea Snake (animated)</li><li>Mystery Animated 1</li><li>Mystery Animated 2</li></ul><p><em>Ten Thousand Ships</em>, a prequel taking place a millennia before <em>Game of Thrones</em>, was thought to have been shelved, but in June Martin confirmed that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-ten-thousand-ships-alive-again-8662533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/george-r-r-martin-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-ten-thousand-ships-alive-again-8662533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moving ahead after all</a></span>.

It’s not completely clear what Martin’s level of involvement is in all of these spin-offs, and how much time and energy they do or don’t take away from him actually finishing the original set of books. I’m sure brainstorming all of these other ideas is a lot more fun. </p><p>And with <em>House of the Dragon</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-of-the-dragon-book-season-2-adaptation-finale-1851607960">finding its footing in season 2</a></span>, it seems likely HBO will be pushing these in-development pitches ahead with more gusto than ever.

Monster Hunter Wilds might not be out until next year, but Capcom has just given the hype handle a tiny tweak with the release of three new videos detailing some of the mechanial additions and refinements players can expect when this latest series entry shows up in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Video number one, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc57d8BTSpM">Basic Mechanics Overview</a>, whizzes through some of the most fundamental aspects of Monster Hunter gameplay before introducing Wilds' new bird-like dino-mount, the Seikret. This (alas) replaces Monster Hunter Rise's awesome dog-like Canyne, serving as a new way to speed about the place.
</p>
<p>
The Seikret can automatically guide Hunters directly to their target if desired, and players are free to gather items from the environment, drink potions to recover their health, sharpen their blade, or switch between primary and secondary weapons ready for battle while in the saddle. The returning Slinger has also had a bit of an upgrade in Monster Hunter Wilds; as well as being able to launch different ammo types found around the map, it can gather items from a distance, and yank loose bits of scenery (rock, for instance) onto monsters' heads.
</p>

<p>
As for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2h3Uxj7nNg">Capcom's second video</a>, that focuses on the classic Great Sword - a weighty blade with slower movements that can pack an absolute punch. More notable, though, is its mention of Wilds' new Focus Mode - which gets a larger airing in <a href="ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v3lnXyNFhI">video three</a>.
</p>
<p>
Focus Mode enables Hunters to more precisely position their guards and aim their attacks, specifically to target a monster's wounds and weak points - which are now explicitly highlighted with a glowy red effect while Focus Mode is active. Walloping wounds or weak points while in Focus Mode does additional damage, which Capcom is calling Focus Strikes.
</p>

<p>
And that's pretty much everything for now. Hopefully, Capcom will have more to share during this year's Gamescom (it'd be nice to see something other than Monster Hunter Wilds' desert map, for instance), and perhaps it won't be long before we get a more precise indication of when it'll be showing up for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam next year.

		<p>I can't remember having a summer as personally busy as the one I've been experiencing over the past few months. Looking over my calendar, I have not been home for two weekends in a row since late May, and it's a pattern that will be ongoing until early September, when I'll attend PAX on behalf of my parenting and gaming newsletter, <em>Crossplay</em>. At least my family is coming to that one, and this past weekend was a fun one, with one of my longtime best friends having a bachelor party in San Diego. It was two days hanging out on the beach, and after a week that involved some up and down family health stuff that, before you ask, is thankfully looking okay, it was much needed.  </p><p>-pk, who spent two hours boogie boarding on the last day because he knew that when he left the water, he would leave the ocean behind</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Daily Dad Rock was rudely interrupted by a phone call from my children's daycare, informing me my oldest was throwing up at a pool. Thankfully, it looks like they just irresponsibly spun around on some playground equipment and did a number on their stomach. I've been hoping my oldest would be spared my weak stomach, which I inherited from my mom, but it's not looking good so far. I'm gonna try to stream in the afternoon, but worst case, we were at least able to publish a back-and-forth with me and Rob reminding about the old internet.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> Again, more boulder rolling, before we return to our ongoing <em>College Football 25 </em>dynasty adventure. Did things go well for us last time? It depends no whether you believe me abandoning the run, hoping Rob would know how to pass the ball, is things going well or not. But the setup is the same, with Cado handling roster management, Patrick calling plays, and Rob controlling our destiny in the game itself. Godspeed to us all.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>We'll kick things off with Sports! live, reacting to the first episode of Hard Knocks, reminiscing about several former Bears players who entered the Hall of Fame, and probably doing a decent amount of Olympics chat. I'm going to ask for voicemail questions for this one, something we did early in our Sports! run, which is why we're going to give this a go live. A podcast version will be available as well, probably the next day. I'll also get around to pushing a rock in the afternoon.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>Remap Radio recording will happen, and then in the afternoon again, it's boulder time. Can I beat <em>Nine Sols</em> before this recording? Probably not, but I am only a few bosses away from the end. I am worried this will be a <em>Sekiro</em> situation, though, where I get to the final boss and just go "nah." Incredible game, though.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Besides Remap Radio publishing, we'll return to Daddy's Dogma, as we try to finish out <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>. I'm not sure if we can do it in one stream or not, but we're in a world where we could push towards the endgame, and I'm inclined to make it there, as I'm itching to play <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. But before the dragon's and the dogmas, I'll, of course, push a rock.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

It’s not like there will be a new Fox Marvel movie anytime soon, so <em>Deadpool</em> is going to go as wild as it wants. If you enjoy that all-encompassing multiversal mayhem, then there really is no better option than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/15487/deadpool_kills_the_marvel_universe_2011_2012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/15487/deadpool_kills_the_marvel_universe_2011_2012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe</em></a></span>.</p><p>The name says it all with this iconic limited series. In it, Deadpool just goes out murdering all your favorite superheroes. The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Hulk, and more all get violently done in. There is a reason for it all: He’s been brainwashed by super-villain to do this, but that doesn’t really matter. The comic gives readers the signature <em>Deadpool</em> humor mixed with a big dose of outrageous action. This arc also gets bonus points for making Taskmaster, one of the coolest villains Marvel has to offer, as a major antagonist.</p><p><em>Deadpool Kills The Marvel Universe</em> is a short, four-issue series so you don’t need to commit a lot of time to reading it all. However, if you want more, then good news: this is actually the first of a three-part arc called the Deadpool Killogy. The rest of the trilogy pits Deadpool against famous characters from classical literature, and himself—it’s a wild ride from start to finish.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-recommend-id="image://b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-recommend-id="image://b1b1aa7adb3f29f59910c1bf5da82f73" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine dresses Deadpool in a Jean Grey costume" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Stuart Moore</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Shawn Crystal</strong></p><p>Fresh off the <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>movie, many will want to see more shenanigans from the titular duo, and comics have a lot of stories to satisfy that hunger.

The elevator pitch goes like this: An evil robot wants to kill Jean Grey, and in order to stop it, Wolverine—against his better judgment—turns to Deadpool for help. Hilarity ensues.</p><p>This is a one-shot that’s a great time. Deadpool delivers his signature jokes while Wolverine plays the comedic straight man, and it works to excellent effect thanks to writer Stuart Moore’s incredible handle on both characters. The story is also a great action showcase, with energetic panels showing off the duo in a high-octane battle against the evil robot.</p><p>Throughout their long history together, Deadpool and Wolverine’s best moments have been in random issues in larger series. The two have often been ships passing in the night. <em>The Decoy</em> embraces that one-off nature to deliver a short but pitch-perfect encapsulation of why everybody loves the oddball team.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-recommend-id="image://cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-recommend-id="image://cab4ebfa6bf6aa612cd77827d03eb3c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool wearing a tux gets cut in half by a laser" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Christopher Hastings</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Salva Espin</strong></p><p>Deadpool is a character who works better when he’s put in the most outlandish scenarios imaginable.

But it continues to one-up itself in every issue, to the point things are so off-the-rails you can barely remember how it got there to begin with. Watching Deadpool throw himself into a story riddled with spy movie cliches is a delight, with fancy cars decked out with gadgets, secret island bases, laser beams, and every other thing you remember from every <em>James Bond</em> movie ever made.</p><p>Sure,<em> Secret Agent Deadpool</em> isn’t the usual superhero fare you get in a <em>Deadpool </em>comic, and surprisingly it has less violence than the character usually engages with, but it works nonetheless. It just goes to show that Deadpool’s humor and cavalier approach to any situation is what makes him such a great character, regardless of what genre he finds himself in.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-recommend-id="image://5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-recommend-id="image://5fca102f03ff5a1e6eafb392325bcc10" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool stands facing front with Deadpool behind" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Daniel Way</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Steve Dillon</strong></p><p>Let’s focus on Wolverine for a second. You may know and love Hugh Jackman’s thoughtful portrayal of the <em>X-Men</em> character, but <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>gives us a slightly different version. He’s a bit more gruff and depressed than in the past (though I suppose not as gruff and depressed as in <em>Logan</em>), and really doesn’t want to deal with Deadpool’s crap. If watching <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> reminded you how much you love the clawed hero, then pick up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2375/wolverine_origins_(2006_-_2010)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2375/wolverine_origins_(2006_-_2010)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wolverine: Origins</em></a></span>.</p><p>Not to be confused with <em>Wolverine: Origin</em>, <em>Origins </em>is a sprawling historical epic about Logan’s long life. It deals with his time in World War II and the Weapon X program, up to his time as a member of the X-Men. The story is tied together by Logan’s quest for revenge on all those who wronged him throughout his life, which is a long list of names. </p><p><em>Origins</em> nails the brooding persona of Wolverine, while digging into the emotional trauma of his past in fresh ways. It also acts as a great tour of the character’s messy comics history. There are a lot of cameos here too, including a substantial multi-issue showdown with none other than Deadpool.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-recommend-id="image://da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-recommend-id="image://da60194c39b12521eee7c8afa3e23829" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Psylocke, and Wolverine stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Brian Posehn</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Jerome Opeña</strong></p><p>Not only have Deadpool and Wolverine teamed up in the past as a duo, but they’ve been part of superhero teams together.

Though what makes that arc, and all of <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>’s arcs work, is the team. Wolverine acts as the leader, with Angel, Psylocke, Fantomex, and Deadpool making up the squad. Elsewhere, Deadpool is often so outrageous as to not be conducive to anything beyond a short team-up with one other character, but here he’s an integral piece of the puzzle. </p><p>This version of Deadpool is more understated,but he still puts on a facade of humor that covers a deeper emotional vulnerability. Watching the character actually learn to work with others in service of something beyond his own selfish goals is excellent. The book also gives us some incredible action scenes that build on the teamwork aspect, allowing us to watch Deadpool rip through enemies when he has a handful of friends to back him up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-recommend-id="image://a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-recommend-id="image://a4c644122fbcabf86c94fad667d818ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Deadpool, Wolverine, and Captain America stand in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Writer: Gerry Duggan, Brian Posehn</strong><br></p><p><strong>Artist: Brian Posehn, Declan Shalvey</strong></p><p>Want to see more of Deadpool teaming up?

Like <em>Uncanny X-Force</em>, this book is a more serious take on the character and it digs heavily into what makes Deadpool tick.</p><p>The story revolves around the Weapon-X program, which ties together the three main characters in the book, and how it has affected all three of them in unique ways. Captain America as the original Super Soldier has to deal with how the world turned to gruesome scientific experiments to recreate him, while Wolverine and Deadpool have to sift through the trauma that the program inflicted upon them directly.</p><p><em>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</em> uses each character to hold up a mirror to the others in the cast. What makes this work is how multi-dimensional it allows that introspection to be.

<p dir="ltr">Sowhatsthecatch (who credits members of the Not Finding A Cow Level Discord, Discord users Jimpen, Tweaked, Teire, and Raffi1337, as well as Reddit user nova_sgx for a video breakdown of the secret), further explains how to obtain the ring in their post. A group of five players (each playing a different class) must first each obtain the Lucky Coin item by looting a specific corpse while under the effect of a Greed Shrine. From there, each player tosses their Lucky Coin into the wishing well in Scosglen, after which they are rewarded with the "Well-Wisher" title and the secret Unique item.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the Ring of Misfortune's item description, it appears as "a seemingly ordinary ring" but fills its wearer with dread. It grants users +13 to all main stats, as well as to armor, thorns, maximum life, and life-per-second. It also grants +13% to all elements. Those are some extremely tiny stat boosts, but it's the Lucky Hit effect on the ring that truly gives the Unique its name--"Up to a 100% chance to lose all of your Resource." Each class has a different primary resource it uses to activate more powerful skills, and a ring that has an on-hit chance to completely drain players of it is, unsurprisingly, terrible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345639" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345639"></a><figcaption>The elusive Ring of Misfortune via Reddit user Sowhatsthecatch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4345639-diablo4ringofmisfortune.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even if nobody in their right mind would ever use this ring, it's still a fun little secret that has finally been blown wide open thanks to the efforts of the Diablo 4 community.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Actors have once again <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209881/mics-down-picket-signs-up">picked up their picket signs</a>. But this time, members of the Screen Actors Guild are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206357/video-game-performer-strike-sag-aftra">striking against the video game industry</a> after negotiations for a new contract governing interactive media and video games fell through. The guild began striking on Friday, July 26th, preventing over 160,000 SAG-AFTRA members from taking new video game projects and impeding games already in development from the biggest publishers to the smallest indie studios.</p><p>Negotiations broke down due to disagreements over worker protections around AI. The actors union, SAG-AFTRA, negotiates the terms of the interactive media agreement, or IMA, with a bargaining committee of video game publishers, including Activision, Take-Two, Insomniac Games, WB Games, and others that represent a total of 30 signatory companies. Though SAG-AFTRA and the video game bargaining group were able to agree on a number of proposals, AI remained the final stumbling block resulting in the strike.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA’s provisions on AI govern both voice and movement performers with respect to digital replicas — or using an existing performance as the foundation to create new ones without the original performer — and the use of generative AI to create performances without any initial input. However, according to SAG-AFTRA, the bargaining companies disagreed about which type of performer should be eligible for AI protections.</p><p>SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said that the bargaining companies initially wanted to offer protections to voice, not motion performers. “So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers’ offer,” Rodriguez said <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6">in an interview with <em>Aftermath</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rodriguez said that the companies later extended protections to motion performers, but only if “the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica.”</p><p>SAG-AFTRA rejected this proposal as it would potentially exclude a majority of movement performances. “Their proposal would carve out anything that doesn’t look and sound identical to me,” said Andi Norris, a member of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee, during a press conference. “[The proposal] would leave movement specialists, including stunts, entirely out in the cold, to be replaced ... by soulless synthetic performers trained on our actual performances.”</p><p>The bargaining game companies argued that the terms went far enough and would require actors’ approval. “Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry,” wrote Audrey Cooling, a representative working on behalf of the video game companies on the bargaining committee in a statement to <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>SAG-AFTRA’s strike rules include a number of exceptions for struck companies and work, which makes it difficult to know the true scope of the strike, especially the games it affects.</p><p>For example, work done under SAG-AFTRA’s Tiered-Budget Independent Interactive Media Agreement or an Interim Interactive Media Agreement is exempt from the strike. Additionally, a specific clause in the IMA called “side letter six” grants an exemption to games in production before August 2023. This means that though Take-Two is a struck company, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>is not considered struck work. However, members of SAG-AFTRA’s negotiating committee have encouraged others to refrain from working on side letter six games.</p><p>“Side letter six permits but does not require performers to render services during a strike,” said Sarah Elmaleh, a video game performer and chair of SAG-AFTRA’s IMA negotiating committee in a TikTok video. “This language made its way into our contract for one reason only, to undermine our union’s most valuable tool: a strike.”</p><p>The last SAG-AFTRA video game strike was in 2016 and lasted 11 months, earning performers fixed rate increases, improved safety assurances on set, and better oversight to prevent vocal stress in voice performers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the novellas, set 90 years before the events of the original <em>Game of Thrones </em>series and the core books, Dunk adopts the armor of the knight he squires for after he dies, and heads to tournament in hopes of winning gold. He names himself “Ser Duncan the Tall,” and gets himself a young squire along the way: Aegon V Targaryen, known as “Egg” due to his bald head. </p><p>The unlikely duo climb the ladder of legendary knighthood in the Seven Kingdoms, starting with this first tournament that is a series of mishaps, misunderstandings, and, of course, bloody deaths.<br></p><p>The brief teaser for <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> suggests the series will lean a bit more comedic and hopeful than other<em> Game of Thrones </em>media, though I’m sure you can still expect violence and betrayals. <em>Tales of Dunk and Egg</em> weaves a much more optimistic story than the dark nihilism of Martin’s other works, so this may be a bit of a palate cleanser after the dreary ending of <em>Game of Thrones</em> and the depressing events of this last season of <em>House of the Dragon</em>.<br></p><p><em>A Knight of Seven Kingdoms</em> will premiere on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://track.flexlinkspro.com/g.ashx?foid=156085.101105873&amp;trid=1197689.218054&amp;foc=17&amp;fot=9999&amp;fos=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.max.com%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a></span> sometime in 2025. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But Electronic Arts had the publishing rights at the time, and we were told that if we were to do a remastered version then it would have to be released on Origin. After joining the NetEase Group we spoke with Electronic Arts again, and since the Origin-exclusive thing was no longer an issue they told us we could go ahead and do it however we wanted. We’d been wanting to do the remastered version for a long time, and so now that we were finally able to, we went for it.</p><p>“As for the <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em> remaster, we didn’t know anything about that—we found out about it at the same time everyone else did. We have nothing to do with that.”</p><p><strong>Why do you think <em>Shadows of the Damned</em> still stands out today?</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Suda:</strong> “It’s a game that I made together with Mikami and the staff at Electronic Arts, and we all put lots of passion and work into it. For better or worse, there was a lot of conflict during development, but I feel like that was part of the sort of a chemical reaction from which characters like Paula, etc. were created, and it ended up turning into a really ‘Grasshopper Manufacture-ish’ game.</p><p><strong>What inspired your vision of the Underworld as it’s depicted in <em>Shadows of the Damned</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “The setting of <em>Shadows of the Damned</em> was originally based on a famous South Bohemian town in the Czech Republic called Cesky Krumlov. Some of the development staff—some of the background artists and other art staff—actually went there and took lots of photos for reference material. Some of the environment was also based on Prague in particular, and the Czech Republic in general.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shadows-of-the-Damned-Interview_08-05-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about how Shinji Mikami influenced the creative direction of the game, and maybe give us an idea of where the split was in terms of how much was Suda versus how much was Mikami?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “The creative stuff—the original scenario / story, general vibe, etc.—was all me, and then Mikami came and provided a lot of advice and ideas, and helped tweak and decide on a lot of the finer details as well. Mikami fully acted as director, which made it easier for him, as fortunately he gave me 100 percent of his trust and support.”</p><p><strong>What was Mikami’s input this time around?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “He has been extremely supportive of the entire endeavor around the remaster. It’s a ‘remaster’—not a ‘remake’—so content-wise it’s the same as the original.”</p><p><strong>Despite being a remaster, there does appear to be some new features. Can you talk about that?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “As I mentioned, it’s a remaster of the original game, so the story, gameplay, voices, and music are all the same. But the remastered version also includes a few features we wanted to add originally but were unable to, namely a New Game+ mode and four new costumes for Garcia. The graphics have also been updated for modern consoles, and we added haptic feedback support, and for the PC version we’ve added support for keyboard and mouse controls as well.</p><p><strong>Will there be any changes or cut content? Have any character designs or outfits been updated?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “None of the original content has been cut or censored for the remaster. The character designs are also the same as before, but again there are four new costumes for Garcia: ‘Placa Garcia,’ which is half-naked Garcia showing off his tattoos; ‘Demonio Garcia,’ which is a demonized version of Garcia that also provides doubled attack power; ‘Ocho Corazones,’ which is based on Eight Hearts from <em><a title="Games > No More Heroes [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>: Travis Strikes Again</em>; and finally ‘Kamikaze Garcia,’ which is based on the character Kamikaze Wataru from the Kurayami Dance manga.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shadows-of-the-Damned-Interview_08-05-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you talk a bit about how the game’s graphics and audio are being updated?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “The graphics have been bumped up to offer 60 frames per second / 4k resolution support (except for the Switch version), and the audio is the same as the original version.”</p><p><strong>Is Akira Yamaoka returning for the remaster? Can we expect any new tracks?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “There are no new tracks included in the remaster.”</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge in tuning the game for modern audiences?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “Nothing, really—we kept the content exactly as it was originally, so everything is still in there, warts and all.”</p><p><strong>So we can expect the same exact gameplay?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “Again, gameplay is exactly the same as in the original, so it should feel exactly the same, but prettier.”</p><p><strong>With <em>Shadows of the Damned</em> returning, are you thinking about the possibility of more games in the series beyond this remastered release?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “If the remaster sells well enough, and if it seems like enough people really want it, then some sort of continuation of the series would absolutely be something we would at least consider working on in the future.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shadows-of-the-Damned-Interview_08-05-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What is your first thought on what a new <em>Shadows of the Damned</em> game might look like?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “There was actually a sort-of ‘sequel’ to it included as part of <em>No More Heroes: Travis Strikes Again</em>, where we used Eight Hearts / Johnson (who again, appears in game now as new costume). One possibility for a new <em>Shadows of the Damned</em> game could be something like Eight Hearts going on a quest to help Garcia, as a continuation of the <em>Travis Strikes Again</em> storyline; or possibly a prequel, portraying how Garcia came to be a demon hunter.”</p><p><strong><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</em> will be your first new release since <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/10/netease-games-acquires-grasshopper-manufacture">being acquired</a> by <a title="Companies > NetEase Games [347 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netease-games">NetEase Games</a>. Can you talk a bit about what that’s been like? Has there been any discussion or cooperation with other NetEase studios like <a title="Companies > Nagoshi Studio [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netease-games/nagoshi-studio">Nagoshi Studio</a> or <a title="Companies > Ouka Studios [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/netease-games/ouka-studios">Ouka Studio</a>?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “We’re not really directly connected with any of the other first-party studios in the NetEase Group, so I don’t know much about what they’re doing; we all focus on our own stuff. Some form of collaboration or <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> project could happen in the future, but we don’t have any plans like hat at the moment. Each of the first-party studios is doing their own thing—at Grasshopper, we’re currently working on our own brand-new intellectual property—and the NetEase publishing team is kind of experimenting, using this as a sort of test case, and <em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</em> will act as a jumping off point to see how we do things from here on.”</p><p><strong>That one game <em><a title="Games > High On Life [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/high-on-life">High On Life</a></em> also has a talking gun. Do you take credit for giving them that idea?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “Not at all (laughs). I do think it’s really cool, though.”</p><p><strong>So, hell aside, what’s a normal date night for Garcia and Paula look like away?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “They’d probably be in Tokyo, since it’s so cheap in Japan right now. As for where exactly they’d go, that would be up to them, but maybe a hot springs, since there are a lot of really great ones here in Japan.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Shadows-of-the-Damned-Interview_08-05-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What’s going on with that <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/grasshopper-manufacture-teases-new-game-in-grasshopper-direct-2023">new game you teased</a> in Grasshopper Direct 2023? Feel free to tell me the title / announce it right here and now.</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “Well, we’re currently developing our all-new intellectual property, and I’m afraid I can’t say anything yet, but we’ll provide updates in the future. Again, I’m sorry for not being able to talk about it just yet, but please be sure to report on it when I’m finally able to!”</p><p><strong>Back in 2022, <a href="reference: https://www.gematsu.com/2022/10/no-more-heroes-iii-interview-with-goichi-suda-51-suda-new-platforms-creating-the-series-finale-ports-and-more">you told us</a> you’d like to collaborate with <a title="Companies > Marvelous [1,316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous">Marvelous</a> to release <em>No More Heroes 1</em> and <em>2</em> for <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,616 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> and <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,478 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>. Is that still something that’s on the cards?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “They’re currently on Switch and Steam—<em><a title="Games > No More Heroes III [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/no-more-heroes-iii">No More Heroes III</a></em> was originally a Switch exclusive, and the <em>No More Heroes</em> series in general was originally made specifically for <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,550 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> consoles, but we may put out ports in the future. I’d have to discuss it with Marvelous.”</p><p><strong>Intellectual property owner issues aside, what game do you want to remaster next?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “<em>Flower, Sun, and Rain</em>. It’s an old Grasshopper title, and fans have been asking for it for a long time. We really want to do a remaster this one and put it on Steam, etc., to make sure that it properly survives as part of the Grasshopper Manufacture catalogue. Also, possibly <em>Michigan</em>—maybe someday.”</p><p><strong>What game do you want someone else to remaster so you can play it again on modern hardware?</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “Maybe <em>Road Rash</em>. I played it on the 3DO way back in the day, and I’ve heard talk of a possible remake but it doesn’t seem to have gone anywhere. Hopefully EA will make it someday. Also <em>Burnout</em>—the series ended with <em>Burnout Paradise</em>, which I was really sad about. I hope that series get renewed someday, too.”</p><p><strong>What do you want to say to our millions* of readers before we sign off? Feel free to promote yourself, your game, the wonderful staff at Grasshopper Manufacture, your dog (do you have a dog?**), your favorite bar, etc.</strong></p><p><strong>Suda:</strong> “I recently went to see <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> on opening day, and it looks like it’s been a big hit everywhere, so I’d like to know what everyone thought about it. Also I love <em>X-Men</em>, so I can’t wait to see what they do next. I was really surprised by the news about Robert Downey, Jr. playing Dr. Doom, and I’m already getting hyped for that. I can’t wait to see how all the pieces fall into place. I’ve been listening to a lot of (Japanese rock band) Zazen Boys recently, so please check them out if you get the chance. They write some really awesome lyrics, so for anyone out there studying Japanese I’d recommend listening to them for practice.”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Suda!</strong></p><p><em>*Allegedly.</em><br><em>**Suda does not have a dog.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of its release later this month, Ubisoft has shared more details on its post-launch content for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-characters-and-everything-we-know/1100-6515795/" data-ref-id="1100-6515795">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.

			<p>The new and upcoming Zelda game, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom has received a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHJFr5EW5bA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brand-new trailer</a> that was released today. Titled "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Traversing Hyrule," it showcases some of the environments that players can expect to explore as Zelda makes their way through Hyrule.</p>
<p>First, the trailer showcases the Gerudo Desert, home to the Voe, women who are exclusively allowed into Gerudo Town. Gerudo Desert is prone to sandstorms, which can obscure visibility for explorers as you traverse through the game. As you explore Gerudo Desert, you'll get to explore vast ruins that have plenty of unique creatures hiding around every corner. In addition, players will also get to explore an oasis hidden away within Gerudo Desert, where there will be a place to relax, as well as speak to some of the nearby NPCs.</p>
<p>Jabul Waters is the next area to be shown off. Compared to the chaos of the ancient ruins in Gerudo Desert, Jabul Waters is "home to some of the most tranquil waterways in Hyrule." In this zone, Zelda can encounter the two different types of Zora: The Sea Zora and the River Zora, both who are starkly different to each other in appearance. From the footage showcased in the trailer, it looks as if the Zora don't often see eye to eye, and Zelda will have to mediate.</p>
<p>The next area showcased is Eldin Volcano, which is home to the famous Kakariko Village, tucked away at the base of the volcano. By traversing the volcano, which is home to many risks and threats for Zelda to conquer, she will eventually make her way to Goron City, where she can meet the Gorons.</p>
<p>Zelda will also get to explore the Faron Wetlands, a lush and humid rain forest, where she'll get to learn more about the Deku Scrubs living in the Wetlands.</p>
<p>Of course, while the main quest is to<a href="https://wccftech.com/link-is-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-too/"> save Link</a>, there will also be a variety of quests given to Zelda in each area that she explores, which will give you rewards and fun story lines to explore by completing them.</p>
<p>One of the new main features that is coming to The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the use of Travel Waypoints. This isn't too dissimilar to those that are present in Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom. Once you've unlocked the Travel Waypoint, you can warp to them from your map.</p>
<p>In addition to the Travel Waypoints, you'll also gain access to a horse, which you can use to trample small enemies as well as jump over small obstacles, which can help you traverse Hyrule. The horse can be summoned easily by crafting a Carrot Echo, which can then allow players to summon their steed from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Another new feature is the addition of Business Scrubs, where you can make Smoothies using the ingredients that you've collected on your travels. Each smoothie has a different effect, and can help Zelda on her journey through Hyrule.</p>
<p>Zelda is given a new ability in this game called Bind. When creating Echoes isn't enough to help her bypass obstacles, Tri can bind her to an object, which moves in tandem with Zelda. It can be used for a multitude of things, such as unearthing buried treasure or throwing enemies off of a cliff.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is to be released on September 26, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/the-old-internet-was-better/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>It's easy to take the modern conveniences the internet provides us for granted now, and it's even easier to take the sheer existence of the internet for granted, too. Slowly, and then quickly, it was a fundamental shift that altered everything around it, to the point that it's difficult to imagine life before the internet existed. </em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick were around before the internet was a thing for the masses, and experiencing the early interests aches, pains, and bliss was part of growing up. </em></p><p><em>Today's internet is one of convenience. The old internet required work on your part. Would it shock you to learn that maybe, as we've gotten older, we're looking back at that era with fondness, perhaps even arguing it was better back then?</em></p><p><em>Let's not spend too much time unpacking that one. Just accept it as truth.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Do you remember the first time you used the internet? For me, it’s a hazy mishmash concentrated around a growing pile of America Online discs showing up in the mail. I think we tried Compuserve once, but only because AOL was often too busy to access—yes, you would straight up get a “busy signal” when you were trying to get on the internet!!—and they were offering a free trial. I truly can’t remember if AOL was popular because it was good or good because it was popular, but regardless, AOL was the path into the life and career I have now.</p><p>It was the dial-up era, a time when you shared access to the internet with your phone line, which meant that if someone in the house picked up the phone while you were surfin’ the web, it’d disconnect. Was I supposed to be on the internet at the time my mom picked up? Debatable.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, my family got so fed up with fighting over the internet that we purchased a second line explicitly dedicated to dial-up. By “my family,” of course, I mostly mean <em>me </em>wanting to use it.</p><p>I have fond memories of sneaking downstairs when the entire family was asleep and draping the family computer with big, thick blankets to dampen the excruciating noise the machine would make while dialing into AOL. It would be decades before I realized it was possible to turn this noise off! Doing so might have spared me from being yelled at a few times, but with the time, it’s such a funny story, and that weird noisescape is a nostalgic part of my earlier years.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gsNaR6FRuO0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Sound of dial-up Internet"></iframe></figure><p>The funny part of the early internet is how curated it was. When you logged into America Online, what you were treated to was, in essence, a magazine? There were different pages you could jump to with information, chat rooms, and discussion boards about topics like the news, games, movies, etc. And who can forget, of a/s/l, a term that will have great meaning to a specific age group who thought they were trying to talk to girls, when it was probably a child lying to you.</p><p>AOL is where I debated the death of Aeris—sorry, Aerith—for the first time. It’s where I pirated my first game, and learned the hard way that downloading 99% of a file is not the same as downloading 100% of a file. It’s where I found my first online communities and virtual friends.</p><p>It was possible to open a web browser in AOL, but I can’t remember doing it very often. And honestly, I cannot pinpoint exactly when I shifted from AOL’s siloed nature to the native internet, but it was around the time Netscape Navigator became a thing. If I had to guess, my obsession with video games eventually led me offsite, in the same way that my obsession with video games also led me to the world of IRC (Internet Relay Chat), an early chat protocol that’s directly responsible for a shocking amount of early video game criticism. mIRC for life, bitches.</p><p>What do you remember about your earliest days on the internet, Rob?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@hugo_cmt?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Hugo Clément</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Well I definitely remember AOL and in particular its huge co-marketing campaign for <em>You’ve Got Mail</em>, the Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks remake of <em>Shop Around the Corner</em> that is maybe the single most late 1990s movie ever made. The conceit of the original movie is that two co-workers who cannot stand each other are also secretly one another’s pen pals, falling increasingly in love via letters even as they grow more estranged at work. <em>You’ve Got Mail</em> liberally reinvents the premise to make Ryan the owner of a beloved children’s bookstore and Hanks is the embodiment of Borders / Barnes and Noble. I’ve got a huge soft spot for the film: I don’t think it’s Nora Ephron’s best work, but I think it’s a fascinating document and meditation on a moment in American life where everyone knows profound changes are coming but nobody knows what they will signify, and for the moment life still feels not so very different than it always has before.</p><p>The movie is really ambivalent. About everything: its leading couple and their romance, the vanishing New York that’s already started surrendering to national chains and trendy convenience, our morality… but most of all it is ambivalent about the internet. The film takes its title from the little “You’ve got mail!” voice clip that would crackle from your speakers whenever you logged into AOL and there was an unread email waiting, and throughout the movie we see the way our two Boomer protagonists have already been reconditioned by this new technology to obsess over it and the opportunities it affords to pretend to be someone else. A more authentic version of themselves? The movie isn’t so sure. (Olivia Rutigliano <a href="https://lithub.com/was-youve-got-mail-trying-to-warn-us-about-the-internet-or-telling-us-to-give-up/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>has written my favorite essay on the film</u></a>, arguing that the movie’s uncomfortable contradictions or discordances are the real point Ephron is trying to make.)</p><p>AOL, however, went buck-wild when this thing was coming out. They would send to customers tons of promotional stuff, to the point where it seemed like AOL was treating <em>You’ve Got Mail </em>like an engagement announcement between it and the whole world. The week before the movie came out I got a half-dozen messages reminding me it wasn’t too late to order a <em>You’ve Got Mail </em>bouquet for that special someone. But of course, in some of the same ways that Hanks’ character in the film now reads as a guy who is <em>also </em>about to be wiped out of business by the likes of Amazon rather than as the vanguard of capitalism, AOL was about to start declining. The silo is built around its users made too many other things difficult (I never managed to get connected to a game server via AOL), and once people got comfortable with the likes of Netscape and Outlook, a lot of the hand-holding AOL offered was going to be irrelevant. AOL was convinced this odd little romcom was a testament to how it had conquered American culture, but it turned out to mark the mass-adoption pivot-point that would devastate the entire business model.</p><p>When I was very young and didn’t remotely realize how any of this worked, I wanted to play multiplayer <em>Warcraft 2</em>. We didn’t have an internet connection but we did have a modem and I saw that option in the multiplayer menu for the game so I clicked host game and waited for my opponent to show up. And I waited. And then I went to do my chores, checking in on the game periodically to see if anyone had connected. I was perplexed: I knew the game was popular, why wasn’t anyone trying to find a game and being matched with my modem?</p><p>But once I did know how more of this worked, I will say that direct modem connection games were how I did most of my online gaming. A bunch of my friends and I all had each other’s phone numbers, so we’d give each other quick phone calls to confirm everything was set up, and then we’d connect for hours of <em>StarCraft</em>, <em>Total Annihilation</em>, and <em>Red Alert. </em>Once I got to college and enjoyed access to a 24/7 high-speed connection, I never looked back, of course. But I am not sure I ever had more fun playing multiplayer than when it was basically my and my friends (or not even friends, really: sometimes just the fact that you were both into <em>Dark Reign</em> was enough to strike up a relationship with someone you otherwise didn’t know) arranging matches after dinner, killing our families’ phone lines for hours every night.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Try to get the "You've Got Mail" notifications sound out of your head now. Good luck.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I have a distinct memory where we’d bought a new family computer, but the old family computer still worked, and so my brother and I dragged the machines together into a part of the house, established a direct connection between them, and played a few <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> matches. Neither of us was any good, but it was so unbelievably cool to pull off that magic trick.</p><p>You must’ve been part of the Total Entertainment Network, Rob, right? </p>

While it focuses on Pedro Pascal’s Joel, who seems to be undergoing some kind of therapy after the violent events of season one’s finale, there’s a lot more to pick through in the brief flashes of other scenes that the trailer provides. Given that we know this season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, we can contextualize a fair bit of what we see in the 24-second clip. Let’s break down this preview of Joel and Ellie’s next chapter.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-recommend-id="image://baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-recommend-id="image://baf941341498db276b10709f57a1a82f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie watches the dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first shot is easily recognizable to <em>The Last of Us </em>fans as it’s Ellie at a dance held in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and Joel live in at the beginning of <em>Part II</em>. It looks like they’re re-creating the establishing shot 1:1, as we see Ellie from behind, looking on as other folks dance the night away. She’s an introverted wallflower at this point in her life, and it will take a good dance partner to get her on the dance floor. But we’ll get to her later.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-recommend-id="image://0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-recommend-id="image://0c73efd0354adb95e68a2f79531b6c8d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie's arm is shown with a burn covered by a tattoo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we see a close-up of Ellie’s arm where she was once bitten by someone infected with the cordyceps fungus and thus learned of her immunity. In the years since the events of the first game, she has since burned off the bite with a self-inflicted wound and covered it in a tattoo of a moth landing on a fern. Some set photos of the tattoo had fans concerned about it looking worse than professional <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Emanzii/status/1810628269101744590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Emanzii/status/1810628269101744590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cosplayers’ versions of the ink</a></span>, but the shot we see of it here looks pretty good, I’d say.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-recommend-id="image://e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-recommend-id="image://e61884f3156198a1cb1c39ee004c3e2c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara talks to Pedro Pascal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first <em>Last of Us </em>season introduced new characters who weren’t part of the games, and it seems like season two may be following suit with <em>Schitt’s Creek </em>actor Catherine O’Hara’s character. We don’t know her name at this time, but she appears to be Joel’s therapist. She is shown asking him if he “hurt” Ellie, which he denies, claiming he “saved” her during the first season’s finale when he killed members of the Firefly resistance group planning to kill her to make a vaccine. The next few seasons will most likely be unpacking that viewpoint from multiple perspectives.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-recommend-id="image://8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-recommend-id="image://8cdaaa15a0f038ecc0a3bb0d72c059c5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams out as someone tries to calm her down." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One scene here that I’m not sure how to place is Ellie screaming in what looks like a hospital bed. Could this be a nightmare she has about the events of the first season finale? Could she be waking up in a Jackson medical facility after the inciting incident of the second season and realizing what’s transpired? It’s unclear, but actor Bella Ramsey will be dealing with a lot of Ellie’s most traumatic moments this season, so at least they’re selling the tormented young girl of it all.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-recommend-id="image://a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-recommend-id="image://a166388ce0d9c2a923a1a360bbc3f260" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tommy shoots an infected horde." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a brief clip of what looks like members of the Jackson settlement fighting off a horde of infected from attacking the town. Gabriel Luna’s Tommy is shown with a rifle firing down on them from the top of the gate. In <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, Ellie, Joel, and other townsfolk were shown doing regular patrols around the perimeter to take out infected stragglers, but there wasn’t a scene of infected attacking the town itself. A group did attack a nearby mansion where some survivors were hiding away in the opening hours, though. So perhaps this is just a retooling of those early fights.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-recommend-id="image://407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-recommend-id="image://407e2fc6016016d264d571172380bd1e" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Seraphites run through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While it doesn’t appear to be fan favorites Lev and Yara, we do see a few members of the Seraphite cult that occupies Seattle running through a forest area. Ellie faces a few groups of these bow-sporting cultists during her time in the city, but it’s likely that we won’t see as much of them until sometime after 2025, given HBO seems to be dividing <em>Part II</em>’s story across multiple seasons. The Seraphites are a footnote on Ellie’s story, but are much more significant for other characters in the game’s ensemble cast.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-recommend-id="image://573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-recommend-id="image://573d33c75392bddd088ded4518f5d70c" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina holds a lantern and Ellie fires a rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unfortunately, we only see the briefest of flashes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-dina-actor-isabela-merced-1851159653&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-dina-actor-isabela-merced-1851159653">Isabela Merced as Ellie’s girlfriend Dina</a></span> in this trailer. She’s seen holding a lantern and looking frightened of something off-screen. Most likely she’s trying to be quiet as a Clicker lurks around the room. But I’m sure she’ll be her usual upbeat, chatty self when there’s less danger around. This trailer seems to be looking to capture the violence and drama of the season, so even the brightest lights like Dina are dimmed here.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-recommend-id="image://ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-recommend-id="image://ca16e9d15f0d139dcfeb17d0fecc5eab" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac pulls out a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like last season, there will be some members of the <em>Last of Us </em>games cast joining the live-action show. This time, Jeffrey Wright will be reprising his role as Isaac, the leader of the militaristic Washington Liberation Front. Ellie never meets Isaac in <em>Part II</em>, so if he’s showing up in season two, it does seem like the show will probably be playing around with perspective shifts to some degree. All we see of him do here is draw a gun at someone, but considering he’s a violent sadist in the game, that just sounds like a Tuesday for him.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-recommend-id="image://d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-recommend-id="image://d299edcba3a0e960f2d279151689b454" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abby crawls underneath a fence pushed down by infected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Booksmart </em>actor Kaitlyn Dever is playing Abby, the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. We only get a brief shot of her crawling underneath a toppled-over metal fence as a group of infected claw at her through the gaps, which is a pretty faithful recreation of one of the most tense set-pieces in the early game. It seems like they’re still trying to keep her role a secret from the casual audience, but if you’re new to the series, know you’ll be seeing a lot of her in the coming seasons. She’s bundled up for the winter weather, though. So we don’t know if Dever’s been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103">putting on Abby’s muscles</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b9828693eb853a3d0d261c3ec35d39f0" data-recommend-id="image://b9828693eb853a3d0d261c3ec35d39f0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams as she runs away from a Clicker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie screams as she runs away from a Clicker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9828693eb853a3d0d261c3ec35d39f0" data-recommend-id="image://b9828693eb853a3d0d261c3ec35d39f0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie screams as she runs away from a Clicker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final shot of the trailer is Ellie in what looks to be the underground subway tunnels of Seattle running away from one of the iconic, blind infected called Clickers. These fuckers have been infected by the cordyceps fungus for so long that their eyes have been overtaken by the mushroom-like growth. All things considered, they recreated these creatures pretty well in the live-action show. That makeup team deserves props.<br></p><hr><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Amazon, Howl (BB), TRX (GameStop)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Amazon, Howl (BB), TRX (GameStop)"><em>The Last of Us </em>season two is set to premiere in 2025</a></span>. While we didn’t see many of them in this trailer, we already know a handful of other actors who will join the cast as Abby’s friends from Seattle. Though it’s unclear how much of a role they’ll play next season given much of this trailer’s focus on Ellie’s journey while also having what looks like interstitial cuts with characters like Isaac. So there’s still a lot we don’t know.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
