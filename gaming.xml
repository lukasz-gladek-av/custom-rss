Many expected characters from the base game to return in some way, react to the events of the expansion, or simply play a bigger role in it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">especially ones who have close ties to Miquella</a></span>, the DLC’s central character<em>. </em>The lack of consequence, and the absence of new dialogue that’d further the player’s understanding of the story, have been a sore point for folks who are starved for morsels of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s massive, sometimes inscrutable narrative.</p><p>There’s a contingent of folks who are especially disappointed in the final cutscene of the DLC, feeling that it does very little to pay off the experience that preceded it. That sentiment is likely bred from the fact that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>ends in a <em>massive</em> fight. I’m talking, like, a <em>huge </em>pain in the ass that is even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">rigged against the player thanks to insane hitboxes</a></span>, seemingly unavoidable attacks, and the kinds of long combos that <em>Elden Ring </em>has become infamous for doubling down on. Once you have beaten that absolute unit of a final boss, there’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxaaugb0au4&amp;pp=ygUkc2hhZG93IG9mIHRoZSBlcmR0cmVlIGZpbmFsIGN1dHNjZW5l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cutscene</a></span> that can be triggered, and many fans of the game are none too pleased with its brevity and lack of <em>oomph</em>, for lack of a better word.</p><p><strong>Spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree’s </em>ending follow.</strong></p><p>For many, this ending to <em>Elden Ring</em>’s saga seems like a whimper rather than a triumphant bang. The scene is straightforward enough (or as clean-cut as FromSoftware’s esoterica can be) and that appears to be the source of the tension. Miquella, the quintessential character of the entire expansion, appears for the first time and effectively doubles down on his goal, or at least restates it. There is no pomp to the affair. Miquella is kneeling throughout the scene, which takes place in a void save for the nearby throne of the Elden Lord, and it is over before you know it. It betrays no significant new insight.</p><p>I won’t lie: this <em>does </em>kind of suck ass. I actually get the contingent who were maybe expecting more from the end of this DLC. <em>Elden Ring </em>is an epic, and if this is the end of it, yeah, it’s not exactly what I would’ve expected. But while some are fixated on the short nature of the ending, others are pissed because of how little it appears to add to the story, or at the least their understanding of it all.</p><p><em>Elden Ring</em>, like most of FromSoftware’s oeuvre, is fascinating to digest and think about. I love people who sniff out bits of lore and propose theories about the motivations of characters and the larger schemings of the world. I too have fallen asleep to many Vaatividya videos piercing together scraps of item descriptions into a cogent and deeply tragic narrative. However, these practices have also borne a kind of fan that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/openwindow6am/status/1810779817018872255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demands “<em>truth” </em>from these games</a></span>. People who <em>expect </em>answers for their sleuthing and investment. In my humble opinion, those folks are playing these games—and engaging with art—in a reductive manner, and only getting in the way of their own enjoyment.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799"><strong>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree’s Story, Explained</strong></a></span></p><p>The absolute truth of these games is <em>supposed</em> to elide you, you dingbats. Whatever absolute meaning you are trying to wring from them flies in the face of the entire point of FromSoft’s preferred method of storytelling. If Miyazaki wanted players to know everything about the game, he and his team could’ve simply written it out for you in a game rich with endless dialogue, exposition, and scenes pontificating on every minute detail. The fact that these games have never fit that mold should have clued you all into an obvious fact: there is no truth waiting for you at the center of <em>Elden Ring</em> or its expansion.</p><p>Disgruntled players who can’t believe that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>would end in such an abrupt and curt manner are outright hoping that there’s a secret ending to be uncovered. Though <em>Elden Ring </em>didn’t have a secret one, it did feature multiple endings depending on what quests you completed and what force/faction you ultimately aligned with. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>lacks a similar framework, and Miyazaki has outright stated that the DLC wouldn’t impact the endings already baked into the game, but that hasn’t stopped a select few from praying that those claims were little more than a red herring.</p><p>I find how little I understand <em>Elden Ring </em>to be a fucking joy, y’all. When I do come back to it, I love trying to click the puzzle pieces together. Some of them fit, and others don’t. Some of them may <em>never </em>click and that’s okay. I can master the game’s mechanics and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-gideon-boss-1851576225">dog-walk half of these bosses in my sleep</a></span>, but there’s <em>something </em>about the fact that I may never really understand all of its mysteries, including Miquella’s motivations for abandoning the Lands Between and seeking godhood, or whatever people are bent out of shape about. I’ll never really stop exploring the larger-than-life cast of <em>Elden Ring </em>and that keeps the thrill of it alive. I don’t need to know everything about <em>Elden Ring </em>to know that I love it and love being engaged by it. Believe it or not, that’s enough.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The grass-type gecko is one of the starter Pokémon from Generation III, and its shiny form is pretty sick. Its green skin is replaced with an aqua blue and its tail becomes an orange-red, and it carries that color scheme through its entire evolutionary line. You can see why someone might want those rare colors instead of the standard green. That is what Aelfgar was hoping for on July 9 as he reset his <em>Sapphire </em>games on stream <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2193505576&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2193505576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for over two hours</a></span> waiting for one to show its red tail…until he accidentally reset the game when two of them showed up.</p><p>Volume warning:</p><p>The pain is tangible as he is left speechless while rewatching his own clip.

            <p>
GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the sequel to 2019's scrappy but enjoyable historical fantasy RPG GreedFall, will launch into Steam early access on 24th September this year.
</p>
<p>
Despite its rough edges, the original GreedFall was a bit of a surprise hit, its blend of RPG action and BioWare-style player choice striking enough of a chord that it went on to sell 2m copies. So it wasn't a huge surprise when developer Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/historical-fantasy-rpg-greedfall-is-getting-a-sequel-in-2024">announced plans for a follow-up in 2022</a>.
</p>
<p>
As we learned at the time, GreedFall 2 begins three years prior to the events of the first game, casting players as a Teer Fradee native, uprooted from their island home and taken to the continent of Gacane. Here, they must use "diplomacy, cunning, or combat", as well as help from their allies, to regain their freedom and "end one man's ambitions of conquest, which could spell the end for the continent and your island."

<p>
"Travel across new landscapes, from Olima... to the shores of Uxantis, and uncover the secrets of these ancient lands," GreedFall 2's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/Greedfall_II_The_Dying_World/">Steam page</a> continues. "Meet all the factions that share control over these nations and navigate the treacherous waters of their schemes and conspiracies."
</p>
<p>
Spiders <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-will-launch-in-early-access">confirmed its plans to launch GreedFall 2: The Dying World into Steam early access</a> back in March, explaining it would be "relying heavily on early access to collect player feedback and see if we're heading in the right direction." In particular, it said it was keen to get the game's combat in front of players because it was "something new".
</p>
<p>
And now the studio has confirmed early access begins on 24th September, when - as it explained previously - players will have access to the "entire beginning of the game". Spiders plans to release updates at "regular intervals" after that (saves won't be compatible between updates, it's warned), all leading to GreedFall 2's 1.0 launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, that final release will maintain some of its predecessor's charm. As Eurogamer contributor Malindy Hetfield wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-review-technical-shortcomings-are-overcome-by-an-abundance-of-heart">review of the first game</a>, "GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults, and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings."

However, they’ve discovered that the update has also created entirely new ways in which you can make your character look quite silly.

The trend has quickly spiraled into players just making all sorts of silly faces, many of which recreate memes from all over the internet. Some great examples include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/eclipseorzea/status/1811182418520392108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one poster</a></span> making their Viera look like the meme of Jamie Lee Curtis yelling at someone and then drinking a glass of water, as well as so many female Hrothgar players just making their Warriors of Light do cat memes. Take a look at what the <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> community has come up with thanks to all these new bones.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you've had your eyes on GreedFall II: The Dying World for a while now, you won't have to wait too long. NACON and Spiders officially announced that the roleplaying game will enter Early Access on September 24. This title expands on the universe of GreedFall, which has a strong community of over 2 million players. If you are interested in Early Access to GreedFall II: The Dying World, it enters Early Access on Steam specifically as of September 24.</p>
<p>When this releases, players will get to explore the beginnings of the game, including the first few chapters, which introduce players to the realms of Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis. While players get to explore these brand new areas, there will also be important characters that you get to meet along the way. You will then get to form bonds with some of these characters, and they can accompany you on your adventures as you explore these brand-new realms.</p>
<p>GreedFall II: The Dying World will continue to be updated throughout the early access period, where you will see more content consistently added to the game. This includes brand-new quests, new features and improvements, and exciting zones to explore to give you the most impactful experience as you play the game. If you have yet to hear about the game, check out their<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sol7cwP8mI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;new release date trailer </a>to see what you can expect by getting stuck into GreedFall II: The Dying World.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6sol7cwP8mI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this game, you are a native of Teer Fradee and were uprooted by force from your island. You were then made to travel to the continent of Gacane, home to the colonists. Compared to home, this continent has an old-world feel, and you have to survive through the constant state of conflict, Malichor Plague, and outrageous political scheming as you try your best to carve out your destiny and break away from Gacane. Through it all, you must try to stop one man from taking over the world. If he succeeds, it could cause the entire world to fall to pieces.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, console owners will have a bit of a longer wait. GreedFall II: The Dying World will be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 once the game gets out of early access.</p>
<p>Why not jump back into GreedFall during the wait and check out their DLC to prepare for your upcoming journey from Teer Fradee? Additionally, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/">our preview of GreedFall 2: The Dying World</a> to see if it's a game you are prepared to dive into.</p>

This time, his latest creation is NSFW. The content creator was able to get the original Doom running on a Tifforun sex toy—specifically one marketed as an Automatic Telescopic Masturbator.</p><p>According to Christophel, this was one of the only electronic fleshlights he could find that had a built-in screen. Once he got his hands on the sex toy, the creator cracked it open and stuck some extra hardware inside to help the device run Doom. </p><p>To play <em>Doom </em>on Tifforun’s sex toy you simply use the device’s pre-existing buttons to move the Doomguy forward, backward, and left to right. Another button fires your gun. Simple as that. And when you kill a demon or zombie in this version of <em>Doom </em>the device pumps once, providing anyone with a penis some pleasure. But you only get one stroke per kill. So if you want to finish the fight, so to speak, you’ll need to do a lot of killing. </p><p>Anyway, I’m nervous about the future of <em>Doom </em>ports. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374">Now that most devices have been added to the list</a></span>, I worry about what comes next. There are probably a lot of sex toys out there that can’t run <em>Doom </em>yet. Well, for now...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The video shows off a pool area for attendees to float around in as well as a steep, stomach-churning waterslide, but the team also promises other features, including lazy rivers, wave pools, water coasters, changing rooms, sunbeds, lifeguards, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Building upon its highly successful predecessor, <em>Planet Coaster 2</em> gives players the ability to push the boundaries of creativity like never before,” Frontier explains. “Be inspired by spectacular real-world parks and create vibrant guest plazas with enhanced building and pathing tools. Intuitive piece-by-piece building tools and mesmerising new themes make it simple for players to elevate their park building to the next level.”</p><p>Planet Coaster 2 aims to enhance the experience players remember from the series’ last outing, so while new watery tools will freshen up the theme-park management gameplay, some fan-favorite rides will return, too. Other new tools include animatronics, smoke, water jets, and unique sounds to ensure guests stay happy. </p><p>Frontier also promises three game modes to enjoy: Career mode, Franchise mode, and Sandbox mode. Career sees players completing specific scenarios, while franchise challenges players to build out a worldwide park network. Sandbox, meanwhile, lets thrill-seekers design parks to their heart’s content.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Planet Coaster 2 Gallery</h3></div></output><p>Finally, Frontier says playing with friends will be “easier than ever” in Planet Coaster 2. That’s thanks to the ability to visit friends’ parks and compete in Franchise mode leaderboards. Even Sandbox mode includes the option to jump into shared levels, allowing for cooperative building across platforms.</p><p>Frontier plans to reveal further details in Frontier Unlocked livestreams, which are set to premiere on the last Wednesday of every month. We enjoyed Planet Coaster upon its launch in 2016, giving it an 8.5/10 in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/planet-coaster-review"><u>our review</u></a>.

According to Lintern, it was clear from the moment he walked in that he had underestimated the scale of what was going to be asked of him. He said, "Now, I'm not entirely stupid, but I had not heard of Mr. Miyazaki before. I didn't know the game... and I didn't know his status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately." Luckily, the voice director Adam Chapman took him under his wing immediately, clarifying what the role would expect from him.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-considering-ceasing-marketing-of-xbox-consoles-in-emea-shifting-focus-to-game-pass/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has reportedly decided not to continue to market Xbox Consoles in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), focusing solely on marketing Game Pass, controllers, and its Cloud feature instead. This consideration comes after they announced that they are hiking up <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Game Pass prices</a>, which has caused a huge stir in the gaming community.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been peddling that you <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox-says-new-fire-tv-app-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no longer need an Xbox to play</a> or utilize Xbox services, with many day-one Xbox releases also being released on PC. Alongside this, they promote their Game Pass subscription, offering plenty of offers to new subscribers, especially through the Discord Nitro gifts.</p>
<p>All of the recent changes within the Xbox team have come as Microsoft is beginning to navigate its new financial year, which means plenty of changes are to be expected. We have already seen many Xbox employees being <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-xbox-layoffs-at-microsoft-inbound-this-week-tom-warren-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a>.</p>
<p>A while ago, Tom Warren of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196361/microsoft-xbox-no-console-required-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Verge</a> received a tip suggesting that Microsoft was shifting its focus on promoting its consoles for the new financial year. As it stands, the tip has not been fully verified, so this information may yet turn out to be incorrect. However, considering the significant changes we've seen Microsoft make so far, especially this week, it doesn't sound so outlandish.</p>
<p>This change wouldn't be a shock, as we have seen declining sales of their Xbox Series X|S consoles across EMEA markets for a while, with plenty of gamers choosing a PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, or PC instead. If this change goes ahead, we will see Microsoft focus less on consoles in Europe, meaning we could see a price hike as people would scalp them and then sell them through third parties. While the tip said it would affect the EMEA markets, it specified that it would only be in certain EMEA markets. At the moment, it is uncertain which markets across Europe will be affected.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xbox has released a dedicated app is available on Amazon Fire TV stick, where you can utilize Xbox services without the console. Should Microsoft undergo these changes, it will be interesting to see where the stock allocation goes instead. Especially as they have recently announced their brand-new disc-less Xbox Series X console. What does this mean for Xbox gamers in Europe, and will prices increase as a result?</p>
<p>If Microsoft confirms that it is ceasing EMEA console marketing, hopefully, it will expand and specify which markets will be affected so consumers can make a financial choice before the change.</p>

<p>Intel’s next lineup of CPUs has been confirmed thanks to an update from <a href="https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html#version-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPU-Z</a>. Launching later this year — current rumors range from October to December — Intel will be releasing its Arrow Lake-S lineup of processors. </p>



<p>Based on the CPU-Z update, there will be at least six new SKUs coming. All of them will also feature the new naming convention from Intel for its CPUs.</p>



<p>There will be two SKUs in each CPU tier with the new lineup: Intel Core Ultra 9 285K and 275, Core Ultra 7 265K and 255, and Core Ultra 5 245K and 240. There will be no Core 3 processors with the new lineup.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While we know the CPUs are officially Arrow Lake, what we don’t know are the exact specifics of the new chips. According to rumors, the Core Ultra 9 285K and 275 are expected to have 24 cores and 24 threads. The Ultra 7 CPUs will feature 20/20 while the Ultra 5 245K will have 14c/10t and the 240 will have 10c/10t.</p>



<p>Intel is expected to fully reveal its next lineup of CPUs in the coming months. That will give everyone their first look and the new generation from the blue team.</p>

<p>As the 2024 season has unravelled, viewers have become less interested in the Call of Duty League. Last year, record-high numbers were recorded, but the 2024 season hasn’t delivered against expectations, which wasn’t helped by Activision pivoting to an exclusivity deal with YouTube late last year.</p>



<p>Since Major I took place in January, viewership has declined with each successive tournament, with Major IV – which took place behind closed doors – landing a peak viewer count of just 109,764 users, a woeful low for Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>If this trend continues, the 2024 Call of Duty League Championship could suffer immeasurably from a lower viewer count.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-cod-esports-dying">Are COD Esports Dying?</h2>



<p>Call it a disappointing game or foul decisions made by the tournament organisers, something somewhere has gone wrong with the Call of Duty League. This monopolised, franchised tournament has rubbed fans wrong since day one, with Activision Blizzard opting to scrap the more open-ended COD World League in favour of something stricter and more regimented back in 2020.</p>



<p>This season has been particularly miserable for fans. Here’s the downward trend we’ve noticed in terms of peak Major viewership over the year (data courtesy of <a href="https://escharts.com/tournaments/cod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">escharts.com</a>):</p>



<ul>
<li>Major I: 245,437</li>



<li>Major II: 244,478</li>



<li>Major III: 238,499</li>



<li>Major IV: 109,764</li>
</ul>



<p>Traditionally, things are kicked up a notch when COD Champs rolls around, and this is where all the viewers come out of the woodwork to tune in, watching the best Call of Duty teams in the world fight for the lion’s share of a $2.3 million prize. However, viewership still isn’t back to where it was during the first season of the COD League where Champs is concerned:</p>



<ul>
<li>Champs 2020: 331,000</li>



<li>Champs 2021: 238,794</li>



<li>Champs 2022: 275,244</li>



<li>Champs 2023: 294,178</li>
</ul>



<p>Last season, Major III pulled in record-high viewership figures, with a peak count of 335,170 users tuning in to catch the action unfold in Texas. It was an intense tournament that saw Toronto Ultra win a chip, with controversial rookie, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/scrap-cdl-adderall-call-of-duty/">Scrap</a>, securing the MVP award. Modern Warfare 2 proved to be a solid title for the CDL, and the COD Champs Grand Final last year saw records broken and dreams shattered – and achieved – in a monumental fashion.</p>



<p>But there’s just no real appetite for it this year, it seems. Modern Warfare 3 was a disappointment, the map pool isn’t inspired, and a lot of beef behind the scenes and on the stage has led to many feeling a bit bummed out overall. We’ve had concerns about abuse in the League this year, and some sketchy updates have flipped the meta around too inconsistently for most players to track.</p>



<p>Will this year’s Call of Duty League Championship, which is being hosted by OpTic Texas, be a success, or will the viewer count drop yet again? We’ll know soon enough – the tournament takes place between July 18 – 21. There’s also an immense conflict at play there – on July 18, the final stages of the Modern Warfare 3 tournament at the Esports World Cup will unfold, adding more strain to the CDL’s viewer count.</p>



<p>Let’s see what happens.</p>

I like to participate in such events, as making a game from scratch in 48 hours is a great way to relax.</p><p>Based on the theme, I came up with the idea of “people running out of energy” and built a simple character who was slumped on a couch. I posted a screenshot of it and got a lot of likes—not because of my modeling skills, but due to the resonance of exhaustion the character exuded.</p><p>I decided to make a game with this exhausted character—so he couldn’t just stay slumped on the couch, he needed to move. We’re all familiar with how our bodies feel when we’re extremely tired, standing up was not an option, so I made him crawl on the floor.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This crawling animation got even more likes. I tested the crawling maneuver on the ground in real life and it hurt all over. But since people liked it, I kept it.</p><p><strong>Crawling Like a Bug</strong></p><p>To crawl, especially on walls, humans need to learn from bugs. First, we made a ladybug that can crawl on any surface in a 3D environment.</p><p>The character’s head could copy the way the ladybug moves, but there was still a long body behind the head to account for. What bug is like that? Caterpillars. So, we implemented a feature named caterpillar bones, responsible for anchoring the body to the environment based on the head’s position. So, when you see a person crawling in the game, it’s actually based on the inner workings of a crawling caterpillar.</p><p><strong>Soft as Noodles</strong></p><p>For a long time, the character’s body was like a normal person’s, with bendy arms and legs split in two. Although he could only crawl, he was at least somewhat human.

With yearly releases and rotating sub-franchises, the games have been a big revenue generator for Activision Blizzard on a near-yearly basis, and have been cemented as the shooter to beat or replicate in the eyes of other publishers. But in the eyes of Microsoft, Call of Duty isn’t just a series to have—it’s worth sacrificing everything else for, including the service that has defined its console for nearly a decade.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Price bumps and tier shifts on Xbox Game Pass beg questions">Price bumps and tier shifts on Xbox Game Pass beg questions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Earlier this week, Microsoft announced its plans to bump up the prices on multiple tiers of its&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-increasing-price-of-xbox-game-pass-introducing-new-standard-plan-that-ditches-day-one-access">Xbox Game Pass</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> subscription service.

The Treyarch-developed title marks the first game in the series to launch on the service the same day as it releases for $70 on other systems. It’s unclear how that specific game will be handled </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/call-of-duty-s-game-pass-debut-eschews-new-sub-tiers">tier-wise</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it also doesn’t matter: after fighting tooth and nail with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-accepts-microsoft-s-offer-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation-for-a-decade">Sony</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and regulators like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-wins-ftc-trial-can-proceed-with-activision-blizzard-merger">FTC</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Microsoft finally has the biggest mainstream shooter in the palm of its hands, and it’s going to become a centerpiece of its service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-joins-xbox-game-studios-following-microsoft-acquisition">fully acquired</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Activision Blizzard last year, it was clear that Microsoft really just wanted to add this one particular franchise to its stable. Call of Duty’s always been fairly popular on Xbox, and to Microsoft, this is a golden goose in multiple respects. In the short term, putting the series on Game Pass may finally give the service a significant </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-says-starfield-is-driving-xbox-game-pass-subs">subscriber boost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that Microsoft has been openly wanting for years. Even if it doesn’t, it gives Microsoft something it hasn’t had in a long time, if ever: a bulletproof franchise. Call of Duty isn’t held hostage by its player base (or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ex-343-developers-call-out-microsoft-for-mismanaging-i-halo-infinite-i-">itself</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) the same way Xbox's first-party children Halo and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-game-showcase-2024-promises-a-first-party-deluge-at-some-point-">Gears of War</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are. Those two franchises are beholden to their fanbases in a way Call of Duty just isn’t, and Infinity War or Treyarch (and sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sledgehammer-says-modern-warfare-iii-was-labor-of-love-after-crunch-reports">Sledgehammer Games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) don’t have to make games that effectively apologize for the previous installment. Quality may fluctuate between Call of Duty titles, but the series nailed general consistency pretty early on and kept that streak going, something you can’t fully say for any Xbox series except </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>maybe </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Forza.</span></p><p>Image via Treyarch/Activision Blizzard.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The quality of Xbox franchises has been erratic compared to those from Sony and Nintendo. It’s something Microsoft is actively aware of; during its legal tussles with the FTC about the merger, Phil Spencer and other executives like Matt Booty practically weaponized internal incompetence as an argument for buying Activision Blizzard. That’s why Xbox’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-owes-everyone-more-context-for-mass-xbox-layoffs">layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> this year across subsidiaries at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-closes-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-alpha-dog-studios">Bethesda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other studios angered so many: the “I’m just a little guy” tactic doesn’t work when you’ve spent five or six years buying mid-size studios, then follow those up with grabbing one of the biggest third-party publishers in the world and killing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-killed-ps5-version-of-bethesda-s-indiana-jones-game">multiplatform versions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of their work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for Game Pass? The seven-year-old service now seems like it’s become Microsoft’s one and only lifeline into games, albeit with tears showing in the fabric. Recent years have shown </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/massive-xbox-leak-offers-picture-of-game-pass-deals">how much</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the company is willing to spend on locking down </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-spending-over-1-billion-annually-on-third-party-xbox-game-pass-titles">third-party games</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for the service, and the ways it hopes to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-is-heading-to-amazon-tv">draw in</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> more users.

More importantly, the series is so big in part because there are players out there who make it their One release for the holiday season—if not the entire year—and are fine with just handing over $60 or $70 every fall. Game Pass has become so unwieldy that its various tiers and price changes may actively stop someone from signing up for a membership and direct them toward the Xbox Store.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">success was basically written the moment Treyarch entered full development on the game, which begs the question: is all of this worth it? Is complicating Game Pass and axing unrelated studios worth a brief subscriber boost and putting this single game as the 2024 centerpiece of its whole service? In the eyes of the general public, the answer appears to be an emphatic “not really.” But Microsoft is nothing if not determined to steer things in its favor, even if it means bringing the entire house of Xbox down on itself.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/the-yard-days-of-summer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>It’s July, which means for many parts of the world, it’s hot as hell right now. 75 degrees ain’t always 75 degrees, if humidity has anything to say about it. Your solution to the heat might be huddling in the AC with a video game, or heading to the beach. We all deal with summer—with seasons, really—in different ways. But summer and winter, the most extreme of the seasons, are different beasts.</em></p><p><em>Which got Rob and Patrick thinking about summer itself, and how their relationship has changed with it not only over the years, but the decades. Summer as a kid is not summer as an adult. Hell, it’s not the same as summer as a teenager. It’s only three months, but a long three months.</em></p><p><em>For some, it stirs memories of endless hours on summer break, doing whatever you please. For others, it’s toiling in the yard, whether under the lax supervision of parents vainly attempting a new project or playing soldier in the background. You might be able to guess who did the last one.</em></p><p><em>In any case, summer. It's just a season, Michael. How hot could it get?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Hey Rob, it’s early July. One of the first exchanges you and I had since coming back from the holiday break was about the heat. (It’s okay here right now, sounds like it’s worse by you?) Growing up in the Midwest, I’m used to rapidfire weather changes, and broadly, the heat does not bother me. Humidity sucks, don’t get me wrong, but I think a lot of my indifference—or learned acceptance—has to do with growing up around a pool or lake during huge parts of my life. I associate the warm weather, ironically, with cooling off. I could spend all day in the water, and as we talked about on the HOA podcast this week, chasing that feeling was a huge part of why I poured so much time and effort into getting an above ground pool into our yard this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, when I think back about some of my fondest memories with video games, it’s the summer, especially those years before I was gently—and then more forcibly—encouraged to get a job during those months between school years. It was an opportunity to fully and completely indulge, which is what led me to seeing how far the in-game clock for Final Fantasy VII will keep ticking up and up. For the record, it’s 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds, and then you’re on your own. I’m pretty sure I hit that moment while grinding a goofy chocobo mini-game that helped you uncover an ultra-powerful spell in the game, a summon called Knights of the Round.&nbsp;</p><p>Knights of the Round was, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9aI5RkoeQ&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>sick as hell.</u></a> Worth it? Who can say. I was a kid, long before I stumbled into the person I am today, who spends too much time trying to be <em>efficient </em>with time. But I miss those days where I’d just give myself over to a game, usually an RPG, and stay up until the wee hours of the morning, because I didn’t have to get out of bed until closer to noon.</p><p>There was a rhythm to those days, as lackadaisical as they were. When I couldn’t escape from the heat in a giant vat of water, I would escape from the heat inside with a stack of video games.</p><p>Now, I associate summer with being out of sync. With two kids and thus, an increasing pool of social obligations, my summer weekends are booked before May ends. This summer has been <em>particularly </em>out of sync, because I was out of town three weekends in a row—Summer Game Fest, then a funeral, and finally our big in-person stream—and now I’m pairing a Remap company break around July 4th with a family vacation soon after. One third of the summer has already passed by, but it barely feels like I’ve found my footing in one of my favorite seasons.</p><p>The one constant, though, has been my Steam Deck. I know this device is only a few years old, but it’s genuinely hard to imagine my life without it at this point. At least, it’s hard to untangle my relationship with video games without the Steam Deck, because it’s become my summer out of sync device. If I’m on an airplane, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m in a hotel, I can pull out the Steam Deck. If I’m at a gymnastics practice for one of my kids, I can—well, you get the idea.&nbsp;</p><p>I feel like it helps me have one foot in one world, while I’m existing in another.</p><p>It may seem like a goofy frustration to express, but part of my adoration of the Midwest—and I’m sure this is true for you on the East Coast—is shifting behaviors in the direction of the seasonal changes. There are only certain things you do, or eat, or <em>play</em>, during parts of the year, and especially when fall and spring are so fleeting, time to make good on those can be precious.</p><p>What’s your relationship with the summer months, and how’s that changed over the years?</p><figure><figcaption><i><em>Infinite Wealth</em></i><span>. Now there's a game that understands how to enjoy the heat.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I used to really hate the heat, so summer was always my least favorite season. I think part of my hatred, though, was the fact my parents loved to press me into helping with yardwork and home maintenance projects that were always murderously boring and actively miserable in the heat. “Go weed underneath the bushes,” they’d tell me, handing me a bucket and a trowel and gesturing at a forty-yard line of vine-invested shrubs that wrapped around part of our lawn. They’d be stunned how long it was taking me, then they’d show me how they would have done it, and I realized that usually it was because they were doing a bad job, missing most of the new shoots of weeds erupting in the topsoil, which is probably why the weeds were thriving more than the bushes.&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the demands for me to do yardwork were replaced by demands I go get a summer job, which I must admit did give me a lot of valuable experiences and exposure to jobs and types of people I might not otherwise have encountered, but is also what led me to taking up smoking. It was also when I began to suspect that my parents no longer really knew how the world worked, perplexed as they were by the fact that simply walking to various shops or cold-calling businesses in the Yellow Pages and politely asking if they needed help did not immediately yield gainful employment.</p>

It’s good, even. It’s the image that accompanied this heartfelt message that has fans making a ruckus.</p><p>The attached graphic includes Chuck, the yellow bird featured in a lot of <em>Angry Birds</em> movies and TV shows.

In the episode, Chuck and <em>Angry Birds </em>protagonist Red are locked in a cage by the evil pigs to make them fuck. This is not an exaggeration, this is literally what happens. They’re trying to get them to make an egg for them to eat. It’s a whole thing. But Chuck blushes at the notion rather than reacting with immediate anger, which some fans read as further evidence of him liking boy birds.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Y’all choose the gayest character to make the ‘straight ally,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://@thelameshiver&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://thelameshiver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@TheLameShiver wrote</a></span>.</p><p>“THAT BOY IS *NAWT* AN ALLY THAT IS A WHOLE ASS FRUIT BASKET RIGHT THERE,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FIeshbook/status/1810372940267221165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FIeshbook said</a></span>.</p><p>“So he’s like the straight friend that swears he’s straight but does the gayest things ever,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AShortGuy_/status/1810669118342983724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@AShortGuy_ replied</a></span>.</p></blockquote><p>Some fans elected to just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Mista_Blizzard/status/1810692386026111201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“fix” the graphic</a></span> by putting the standard Pride flag in the background instead. Doing so would have both likely felt true to fans’ perception of the character over the years while also giving the <em>Angry Birds</em> brand some plausible deniability if they weren’t ready to commit that hard. Some of the responses claiming Chuck isn’t straight have been hidden by the official account, but they were mostly ones that either had profanity or direct references to bangin’. There are also some predictably bigoted responses in the hidden replies, so look through them at your own risk.</p><p>The <em>Angry Birds </em>brand has been incredibly online over the years, using platforms like TikTok to create its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/angry-birds-red-tiktok-smash-pass-sega-sonic-sex-1850368291">own versions of popular memes and trends</a></span>.

<p>The Esports World Cup is in full flow in Riyadh, and the list of brands and companies sponsoring the eight-week-long competitive showcase grows longer by the day. More brands have partnered with or sponsored the Esports World Cup than you’d see at most super-sized sporting events, marking the prominence and profile of the ambitious showcase for all to see. </p>



<p>With a prize pool worth $60 million and 21 games being featured over the two months, the Esports World Cup certainly is the biggest esports event in history.</p>



<hr>







<p>Plenty of brands have signed up to have their logo represented somewhere during the Esports World Cup. It’s an event that has already pulled in tens of millions of viewers, and as it’s set to run through August, there’s plenty of length left in the road for other brands to get on board.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that the likes of Mentos, Heinz, and Pepsi all stood up to link their labels with the EWC, which is taking place in Saudi Arabia. That’s only a small assortment of big-brand, household names sponsoring the grandest tournament in esports, though.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Esports World Cup sponsors:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sony</li>



<li>Amazon</li>



<li>Honor</li>



<li>Moonton</li>



<li>Sportfive</li>



<li>The Esports Awards</li>



<li>Level Infinite</li>



<li>Bayes Esports</li>



<li>GRID</li>



<li>LG UltraGear</li>



<li>SecretLab</li>



<li>KitKat</li>



<li>TikTok</li>



<li>Adidas</li>



<li>DAZN</li>



<li>Pepsi</li>



<li>Axe Body Spray</li>



<li>Clear Men Shampoo</li>



<li>Audiotool</li>



<li>Warner Bros. Discovery</li>



<li>Star Sports Network</li>



<li>STC Group</li>



<li>ARAMCO</li>



<li>Barn’s Coffee</li>



<li>Jameel Motorsport</li>



<li>Qiddiya City</li>



<li>Logitech</li>
</ul>



<p>Almost every partnership or sponsorship comes with exclusive activations that support the growth of the Esports World Cup’s profile. What’s more remarkable is the fact that more sponsors are pouring in while the tournaments are ongoing.</p>



<p>Whether local to Riyadh or on an international scale, these brands are helping to ‘legitimise’ a tournament that some esports fans had their fair share of issues with – but are settling over time. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup is a phenomenal event that’s setting a new bar for the industry. Even if you disagree with the setting, you can’t discredit the power of the showcase.</p>

<p>The Wimbledon Championships, which is traditionally known as simply ‘Wimbledon’, is live now and wrapping up this weekend. It’s one of the most iconic sporting competitions in the world, boasting a history that stretches back almost 150 years. Recently, it was revealed that the age-old event is taking a step into the digital age, with the team at Wimbledon promoting and hosting a full-fledged esports tournament focused on tennis.</p>



<p>One of the unique prizes up for grabs is a gold-plated, one-of-a-kind PlayStation 5 console, with the winner’s name being ‘etched onto it by Wimbledon’s official engraver.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-digital-age-emerges">The Digital Age Emerges</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.wimbledon.com/en_GB/news/articles/2024-06-28/the_wimbledon_echamps.html">‘Wimbledon eChamps’</a> is a brand-new concept and a rarely-seen sight in the world of esports. It’s almost unheard of that a tennis game would feature as an exciting esports title, and typically, sports-focused games don’t do that well in general – but there’s plenty of hype around the Wimbledon eChamps.</p>



<p>It kicked off on July 6, with challengers being welcomed from Europe and North America. It all begins with the open qualifiers, after which a regional leaderboard will be established. then, the top sixteen players on each leaderboard compete for the final spots in the contest. It all comes down to the ‘Wimbledon eChamps Finals Event’, an in-person showdown at Wimbledon in London. This will play host to two players from each region – but only one can walk away with the grand prize.</p>



<p>It’s being played on TopSpin 2K25, the newest tennis game on the market and a sumptuous feast of visuals and authentic physics for fans of the sport to lap up. As it’s being backed by BLAST, one of the leading esports event organisers in the world, there’s no doubting the chops that this tournament has.</p>



<p>On September 12, the in-person finals will be held, and the champion will be crowned, walking away with a unique gold-plated PS5, amongst other things.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-boys-season-four-is-going-nowhere-fast.925167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-boys-season-4-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been watching <em>The Boys</em>, Amazon's superhero satire that feels increasingly like it's lost the plot. While Season 4 isn't quite over yet, we'd yelled at each other enough about our thoughts on it that we decided to just get together and hash things out in the blog.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Hey Chris and Riley, we’ve all been watching the latest season of <em>The Boys</em>, a show I once ate up despite its flaws – and because of its simple though useful anticapitalism 101 approach to media and politics – but which now has let those flaws run rampant. Season four has been a corny, too-on-the-nose mess. It’s not really satirizing anything anymore so much as it’s ripping ideas from the headlines and changing some words around, and character beats are repeating ad nauseam. Feels like it should have wrapped up a season ago, but we’ve still got another one to go. I thought things might take a turn for the better after <em>Gen V</em>’s comparably solid showing, but nope.</p><p>What do y’all think? I gather from your posts online that you’re also pretty over this one.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The situation is dire. Really not good.</p><p>Corny is the thing I keep coming back to. I think people made a lot of hay of right wingers realizing they were the targets of satire, but unfortunately they're not entirely wrong here. The show is not as well written as it used to be, and it has this bizarre <em>SNL/Colbert</em> 3 years ago vibe on top of the usual generally vile stuff it does.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>So I should be clear that I struggled to get into this show at all-- I don't really like superhero stuff, and I hoped that what I thought&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' take on that genre was might change my mind. I really struggled to stay invested through its seasons--I'll admit that in previous seasons, I had a tendency to fast-forward through some of the parts containing the titular "boys"--but I've been watching every minute of the show since Season 3, a dedication that Season 4 is making me regret.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Boys – Season 4 Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzFXDvC-EwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A lot of the satire doesn't even make sense!</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You mean like Neuman referencing AOC when she IS that universe's AOC? That part threw me, lmao.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Forcing sex criminal Batman to donate to an Elizabeth Warren SuperPAC. C'mon man.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>God, that part made me roll my eyes SO HARD.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Season 4 does make you regret liking Season 3 which is impressive!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>To harken back to the comment above that right-wingers are mad because they just realized the show is making fun of them, like... OK, I'm not going to defend right-wingers, but the satire this season is just so one-note and over-the-top that I sort of don't blame them for being pissed? Like at least find the subject of your satire interesting enough to satirize it&nbsp;<em>well</em>? The prevailing note to me just seems to be "These people are stupid," which is maybe not untrue, but surely there's some more nuance there?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>If your show is good enough generally people get over it. I think maybe they were tired of people making right wing Homelander memes. Not an excuse to make the show actively worse though!</p><p>All the Fox News stuff feels like it's from a time capsule. A Santorum joke? In this day and age?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The on-the-nose-ness doesn't even feel like it's by design for the purpose of clarifying the show's politics, either. It just feels like the real world caught up to the show, and the writers didn't know what to do with that. So in the absence of any better ideas, they decided to go as big and dumb as possible to generate online discussion and discourse, which is a terrible way to write anything.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I really cannot stress enough how frustrated I feel by how dumb the show is. Besides the juvenile sex jokes, which I will happily rail about at length, I feel like the show just sees everyone in its world beyond its main characters as hopelessly stupid. I was telling Luke this, but I think it suffers from a somewhat similar problem as the movie <em>Don't Look Up</em>: in exploring the relationship between the subjects of media and the people watching that media, it falls into seeing the masses as stupid in order to highlight the uniqueness of its cast. But, like, I, the audience, am the masses! And the show thinks I am some rube who can be swayed by flashing lights on TV or appeals to Jesus (a la the whole Firecracker rally scene, which please let me complain about). It's so tired and depressing and makes me feel like the show hates me for watching it, which makes me hate it back.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Honestly go off man. Outside of her original motivations (being slighted by Starlight as a teen, bad but serviceable), everything about that entire segment was bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> OK SO: Firecracker is giving her whole anti-Starlight/"save the children" rally, hitting all the right wing notes, and as part of that, it gets revealed that she had a relationship with someone under age. But instead of this being some reputation-ending thing, she pivots it on-stage into a "but I accepted Jesus, so it's cool" moment that totally wins the audience over. And that works well with what the scene intends to say about her and the situation the protagonists find themselves in, where Firecracker is so shameless that they can't get leverage on her. </p><p>But, while fully recognizing that all of this is clumsy satire, it felt like the... stupidest understanding of religion to me, someone who studies religion. Like, abuse is rampant in the evangelical churches I presume Firecracker is meant to come from, and a lot of it gets swept under the rug, but the reasons for that are complex and can't be boiled down to some surface-level appeal to Jesus. This abuse isn't allowed to fester just because religious people are stupid, right? I feel like as a piece of satire, this moment does a disservice to the realities of the thing it's criticizing, which I know I'm sensitive about. Abusive leaders or figures getting a pass in the church is way more complicated than that, and acting like it happens because people are just... faith-blind sheep made me really angry, even for a show that I know is just doing bad satire.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Also we have pretty concrete examples of that stuff ending right wing media careers!&nbsp;They're not loyal, they love turning on their own.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Right! Like... how are we supposed to see these people as formidable foes when the show presents them as so pathetic?</p><figure><blockquote><p>Besides the juvenile sex jokes, which I will happily rail about at length, I feel like the show just sees everyone in its world beyond its main characters as hopelessly stupid.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The incoherence coupled with the mediocre writing is really what gets me.&nbsp; Like tonally being that on the nose does not work. The Garth Ennis touch of the show always felt broadly tacky but in a kind of retro way you did not see any more, but mixed with really incoherent politics and plotting it just doesn't land for anyone.</p><p>You could see it coming a mile away, but everything involving Simon Pegg's character made me depressed. What a bad way to tell that story. </p><p>I think the Tek Knight episode really pushed a lot of people over the edge.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Season 3 at least had interesting personal stakes, even if the politics were already getting pretty wonky. Everything involving Soldier Boy was fun, especially once it was revealed that he was essentially Homelander's father. But Season 4 doesn't even have that. I do not care about what these characters are going through, because they've already been through it before. The stuff with Frenchie, especially, is so dumb. Boo-hoo, he killed some people, he’s gonna lock himself in jail. That’s something a person who’s been living Frenchie’s life for, like, a year or two would do. It just doesn’t ring true at this stage of his life.</p><p>The only emotionally compelling thing that’s happened all season was the death of Hughie’s father, and even that was played for shock before it wound up anywhere remotely resonant. Props to Simon Pegg for acting the hell out of those scenes, but still. And then, the very next episode – right after Hughie had scattered his father’s ashes – the show’s writers decided to sexually torture him for… laughs? At least they had Hughie acknowledge that what he went through was horrific, but what purpose did shoving his head in an even deeper vat of misery serve? </p><p>Hughie had already demonstrated growth in his decision to sacrifice his father, to let somebody go for once because after a certain point, trying to save everybody becomes more about your own fear of loss than helping those you’re stubbornly clinging to. The sex dungeon scene was the show’s worst instincts on display – excess and shock for excess and shock’s sake. And it wasn’t even funny! It was just uncomfortable. It felt like yet another waste of time in a season that’s been spinning its wheels from the word “go.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The premise of "What If Batman Was A Sex Freak Who Profits Off Of Misery?" is not itself a premise that is completely without merit, but his entire conversation with A-Train, the way they decide to sexually traumatize one of the main characters, and all in the service of torturing him by having him donate to Democrats. It's like they designed this in a lab to make me&nbsp; dislike them.&nbsp;</p><p>He's not even an interesting pervert! I know that's petty, but c'mon.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Honestly, it's a worthwhile point! In Season 3, they had a different pervert shrink down and crawl inside somebody's dick. That was at least entertaining! And then they try to top that with this vanilla shit?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They already had a guy clone himself to eat his own ass this season. Which wasn't even good!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>The Tek Knight dungeon scene was the first time when watching this show that I thought, "If I wrote for this show, I would be embarrassed." I'm so frustrated by the show's incoherence around sex--<em>everything</em>&nbsp;is a sex joke, and&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;is a sex weirdo, and it's no longer clear to me what any of that is supposed to mean. I wrote about this in one of Aftermath's newsletters, actually, but I'll say here: like, it's revealed that one of the causes of conflict between Starlight and Firecracker is that Starlight called her a "slut" when they were young. But I felt like, held up against everything else the show does with sex, is that an honest motivation? Is that an insult in this world? A lot of the characters are motivated by trying to hide their freaky sex stuff from the world, but at this point, what does that even mean if&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;has a freaky sex thing?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I felt that with Sister Sage, a character I really like and think has a lot of potential but is written into a real corner here.&nbsp;</p><p>Like, it's not a bad premise! You are so smart you become a nihilist and desperately seek mental self abuse to escape being that person for a brief second. But they have just not handled her character well and I really hated the entire backstory info dump this episode.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I agree it could be so interesting, but half the time it--gasp--is played for dumb sex jokes?</p><p>I feel like I've yelled about both religion and sex and sound like a prude, lol.</p><figure><figcaption>Amazon</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That's the thing that really bums me out. A lot of the themes the show is trying to tackle this season COULD be interesting. It's clearly trying to be about death and mortality in a superpowered world. Every main character's arc ties back to this. Homelander is aging and realizing that even invincibility can't help him win the fight against Father Time. Hughie's father suffers from both a stroke and brain damage, and Hughie has to learn to cope with loss. Butcher is at death's door as the result of a brain tumor. Can he make up for a life of bitter regrets with one final, defining action? Frenchie has spent decades dealing death, and it's catching up to him. </p><p>On paper, a lot of this resonates with me, somebody whose grandmother died earlier this year after dementia caused her to decline precipitously. I feel like more skilled writers could pull this off, but they'd need to approach these subjects with care and compassion. A show this sloppy just doesn't have the tools.&nbsp;(edited)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;go to <em>The Boys</em> to learn about grief, I go to <em>The Boys</em> to see people explode very suddenly. I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;need the two at the same time.</p><p>Also, pulling a Tyler Durden with Butcher made me groan. C’mon man. What’re we doing here?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>EVERYBODY saw that coming. The least they could have done was make the reveal more interesting.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I thought there was gonna be more to it!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>With two episodes left in the season, I can't imagine they're going to turn things around. We know they have another season coming, so I wonder: is it going to be more of this, or will they see the light and reverse course somehow?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Based on the last episode I think&nbsp;they’re&nbsp;going to give everyone Super Covid.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Honestly, the high point of the entire season for me was how loudly that part made my partner groan. Just absolute, peak exasperation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Season 5:&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;all mask jokes.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>On the upside, this does mean there's a solid chance that many of the characters we know will die, and that's what needs to happen for this world to become interesting again. Like Riley said, there's still potential in it, but <em>The Boys</em>' main cast is completely tapped. Put them out of their -- and our -- misery.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I'm sort of fond of The Deep-- I think, more so than the other superheroes, we see him struggle with who to be and what kind of good or bad guy he is. But this season, he sucks, and not even in an interesting way, mostly in a--gasp--weird sex shit way again.</p><p>I just really, really cannot stand the sex shit this season. I feel bad about it a little bit! But it's making me feel like I'm losing my mind.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>They gotta stop going back to the cephalopod bit.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;rough.</p><p>And the breast milk thing! Get a new thing!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-traders-first-expansion-void-shadows-moved-to-september-24/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Owlcat Games, the developer of Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, has announced that they are moving the official release date of the first expansion, Void Shadows, to September 24, 2024. The expansion was originally due for release on August 8. Still, the developers have said they need more time to polish the game up as best as possible and "eradicate anything that might spoil the players' experience as they investigate the darkest corners of their voidship or romance a new companion."</p>
<p>For those who have been playing Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, you'll want to keep your eyes and ears out for all the info with the first expansion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pwCNWrK0co&amp;utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=d9a26f20e4-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_06_25_06_07_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-e5f83806f0-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Void Shadows</a>. It adds 15 hours of content to the game and is fully integrated with the main game's story, so you don't need to worry about spin-off confusion.</p>
<p>The new expansion features an exciting story where you get to play as the Lord Captain and get to peek into the lives of the citizens on the voidship while working to tackle a looming darkness that is threatening the existence of those on the ship. You are joined by a brand-new companion named Kibellah, an awesome, relentless Death Cult Assassin ready to pledge her life in service of the von Valancius dynasty, the same way her predecessors did.</p>
<p>While this news may be disheartening to some, it just means that the developers want to work as hard as possible to ensure that a quality product is released that will please all fans. Plus, there is plenty of content to get through in the main game, where you can replay it repeatedly to make different choices.</p>
<p>Whether you want to be the hero or you want to be the villain and be hated by those surrounding you, Rogue Trader has plenty of options and ways to play the game. There are at least 50 hours of gameplay to be had in the game, without doing every little thing present!</p>
<p>If you've exhausted all that, make sure to check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">our review on Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader</a> as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/">Q&amp;A with Owlcat Executive Producer Anatoly Shestov </a>where our burning questions regarding the new DLC have been answered in full clarity. Whether it's speaking about the bug fixes, they continue to bring out the game to be as enjoyable and bug-free as possible. On top of that, they work hard to adjust the UI and other important details so that Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader is as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>Mortal Kombat could be the next classic game franchise to get the remaster treatment. </p>



<p>In something that somehow flew under the radar, Eyeballistic CEO Joe Tresca took to Twitter in late June <a href="https://x.com/calactyte/status/1804358945915510879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">to tease something</a> that his studio is apparently working on. That tease came with a screenshot from an “updated” version of Mortal Kombat 2.</p>



<p>“I’m not sayin, but just sayin, we might be cooking up something special over at Eyeballistic,”  he said.</p>



<p>Immediately, the response from people in the replies was mixed. Some seemed excited about the possibility of a remaster while others criticized the shared image due to it appearing to have heavy AI elements. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Mortal Kombat Remaster</figcaption></figure>



<p>A claim that Tresca didn’t fully deny. </p>



<p>In a reply to a user calling the image terrible looking and stating that they “don’t want AI trash in their fighting games”, Tresca replied with, “I’ll take your opinion into consideration…”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games and NetherRealm Studios for comment on this tease from Tresca. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story.</p>

<p>The game has three game modes to choose from: Career, Sandbox, and Franchise. In Career mode, players will have to solve a variety of different scenarios with varying difficulties. Franchise mode sees players building their own global park network, while Sandbox mode lets them create parks without the stress of money or management.</p><p>There are also online elements, such as being able to visit other players' parks as well as compete on leaderboards in Franchise mode. Players can even build theme parks together in Sandbox mode and share and download blueprints through the Frontier Workshop.</p><p>Planet Coast 2 is the follow-up to 2016's Planet Coaster, which was released for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/planet-coaster-review/1900-6416582/" data-ref-id="1900-6416582">Planet Coaster review</a>, we said, "It's a game that occupies your thoughts when you're not playing it, and it's thoroughly captivating when you are."</p>
