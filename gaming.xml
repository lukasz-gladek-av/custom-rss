		<p>Vertigo Games is returning to their first big VR hit, announcing Arizona Sunshine Remake for Meta Quest 2 and 3, PSVR 2 and PC VR. The remake is coming out on 17th October, with pre-orders now live and a discounted upgrade price for owners of the original game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arizona Sunshine Remake | Reveal Trailer | Meta Quest 2+3, PS VR2, Steam VR [ESRB]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Svid78o9GJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the biggest games from the early days of virtual reality gaming, Arizona Sunshine is now the better part of a decade old, and in danger of being left behind on current VR platforms. Sure, there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">a sequel that launched late last year</a>, but the original game was predominantly a PC VR game for early headsets, and then with ports to the original PSVR and Meta Quest.</p>
<p>The remake will be able to take advantage of the current crop of headsets, being built from the ground-up with an enhanced graphics engine to better utilise Quest 2 and 3, bring the game to PSVR 2 for the first time, and raise the limit of what PC VR can accomplish. There’s also improved VR combat and weapons, and a new mutilation and gore system.</p>


<p>Arizona Sunshine Remake will feature everything that was made for the first game, so there’s all the original DLC and updates bundled in – Dead Man DLC, The Damned DLC, Old Mine update, Trailer Park Update and the Undead Valley Update – and full support for four-player co-op in campaign and the horde mode.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/27/arizona-sunshine-playstation-vr-review/">Arizona Sunshine review,</a> Jim said, “If you’re serious about PlayStation VR and love first person shooters, Arizona Sunshine is a no-brainer. Mowing down mobs of the undead is immensely satisfying with a great spread of weapons and plenty of opportunities to have some fun. The campaign is well-paced, supplying small but welcome diversions to break up the action with little morsels of story here and there. At £33, some players will naturally want more bang for their buck, but the quality of content on offer here is fantastic. With the bar set even higher than before, it will be interesting to watch how developers try to emulate and improve upon Arizona Sunshine.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-helps-new-players-start<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in June, Wizards of the Coast announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-set-helps-bring-new-and-old-players-together" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Foundations</a>. It is a set designed to invite new players into the ubiquitous card game and bring back older cards beloved by series veterans. To that end, the publisher has announced new details on their upcoming Magic: The Gathering Foundations Beginner Box.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamingtrend.com/news/peak-inside-the-foundations-beginner-box-for-magic-the-gathering/">Gaming Trend</a>, the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box will feature two Jumpstart half decks. This is to help teach new players the basics of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and give them some hands-on experience with building a deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=Z8zkinxN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-cat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=_dzjyja5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two half decks previewed in one of the <em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> Beginner Box are themed around cats and vampires. The cat deck is mono white. The vampire deck is mono black. Alongside these two 20-card decks is a step-by-step guide booklet which will walk players through their first five turns.</p>
<p>Once this guided play tutorial is done, the box will provide players the means to express themselves. Alongside the two half decks are eight Jumpstart packets. Players can open two packets each, mix and match different themes, and build a full 40-card deck.</p>

<ul><li>Two themed 20-card half decks</li>
<li>A tutorial guide booklet</li>
<li>Eight Jumpstart packets</li>
<li>Two playmats designed to show new players a standard game's layout</li>
<li>Two spindown dice to track life totals</li>
<li>A rules reference booklet</li>
</ul><p>There is some grounds for speculation on what other themes will be explored in other beginner boxes. Magic: The Gathering has been around for 30 years and has a rich history of creatures, characters, and settings. All of which can hook players in if presented in approachable package.</p>
<p><em>Magic: The Gathering Foundations</em> will be available worldwide November 15.</p>

            <p>I am forever looking for a game to replace Transport Tycoon (or OpenTTD) in my affections. I know there are several railway management sims kicking around Steam, but I haven't found the one that does it for me yet. Could it be Railroad Corporation 2? It's a train tycoon game in which you lay tracks through the early 20th century, and it's launching in Early Access on September 9th.

<p>If you've ever played any of these games, you know what do. You build a choo-choo empire as you lay tracks, buy trains, hire staff, and seek to effeciently transport goods between various towns and trade depots. Railroad Corporation 2 then adds an extra wrinkle with its turn-of-the-century setting, in which you must continue to upgrade your stock to stay ahead of your competition as electrification revolutionises the railway.
</p>
<p>Expansion means more than just laying more tracks in front of your moving train, but also growing the cities you're ferrying goods between by building factories, hospitals, banks, and power plants to supply your infrastructure.
</p>
<p>There's not a lot of detail about its planned Early Access journey on its Steam page, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1677970/view/6892282513992386794">the announcement</a> does say it'll be polished and expanded "over the course of the year". At launch it'll include four campaign missions, and online multiplayer with up to four players in either co-op or versus modes.
</p>
<p>I confess, the first Railroad Corporation passed me by in 2019, but it has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/797400/Railroad_Corporation/">respectable rating from user reviews on Steam</a>. Hopefully the sequel doesn't need bricking up in a tunnel like a naughty engine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll then spend your time hopping between these various planes on a grand, cartoon adventure.

<p>Plucky Squire is from Jonathan Biddle, one of the makers of 2018's Sword Of Ditto, a game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-swords-of-ditto-review">many splendid ideas but mixed execution</a>. Sounds like the perfect person to get a second swing at something. This time, Biddle has co-founded new studio All Possible Futures with former Game Freak artist James Turner and they're partnered again with Ditto publisher Devolver Digital.
</p>
<p>Plucky Squire also made it onto our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">most anticipated games of 2024</a>. 
</p>
<p>I think you can look at the trailer above and go, cor, yeah, that'll be anticipated because of the art, the animation, the energy and all that, but no. I think it's because it's coherent. A 2D guy who pops into a 3D world? Seen it, done it. A <em>storybook</em> guy who pops into the world external to the book? That's ludonarrative cohesion, bud, and we games journalists can't get enough of it. We'll slash some Zelda enemies with a sword until we're dusty skeletons if it's hung inside some sort of clever-clever context.
</p>
<p>What's that? You think I'm <em>already</em> a dusty skeleton? No argument here. I hope The Plucky Squire is as joyful to play as it is to look at when it launches in a month's time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s a deck of cards adorned with some gorgeous art, a game-accurate light-up lyrium dagger that’s hopefully not sharp enough to actually hurt anyone, and a lovely cloth map of the fictional world of Thedas. But the listing on BioWare’s store page says, in big bold letters, that it doesn’t include <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, whether in a steel book case or as a digital download code. It is just a bunch of game-related stuff, without the game itself. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rooks-coffer-edition---xbox-series-x/B414808A.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x%7Cs/products/dragon-age-the-veilguard-rooks-coffer-edition---xbox-series-x/B414808A.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameStop</a></span>, meanwhile, is selling Rook’s Coffer with the game bundled in, and that’s a decent enough half-measure, though it naturally bumps the price up.

I look at this approach and wonder why we’re not calling companies on their shit when they try and pretend these big boxes of doodads aren’t the collector’s editions we’ve always pre-ordered and shoved into a closet after launch, only without the game itself. Why are these packages only getting more distanced from the game themselves?</p><figure id="" data-id="fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-recommend-id="image://fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-recommend-id="image://fb85c49950643c40daa2be2d3220ba24" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dragon Age: The Veilguard's &quot;Rook's Coffer&quot; contents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not every special edition in recent memory has omitted the main event, but a lot of companies have gotten more comfortable calling something a collector’s edition or selling something that looks like one without putting a game in the box. BioWare alone has been phasing out physical game copies from special editions in the decade since we last got a <em>Dragon Age</em> game. <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s collector’s edition had a whole-ass remote-controlled car and a steel book, but you would find no video game or download code in the box. The <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em>’s “Legendary Cache” had a wearable N7 helmet, a steel book, and other things to fill your walls and shelves, but no way to actually play the three remasters. It feels like if you don’t call it a “collector’s edition,” you can get away with leaving out the game, but it still ends up being positioned as such by the companies selling it, even if it doesn’t have the label.<br></p><p>Even if a special edition includes the game through a digital code, it feels antithetical to the inherently physical nature of buying a special edition. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><em>God of War: Ragnarök</em></a></span> pulled the same thing when it included a digital code alongside a steel book case, and now I have that (admittedly beautiful) piece of metal on my shelf with nothing inside it. This is another half-measure, and one that doesn’t help people who live in rural areas with poor internet speeds. When I lived in small-town Georgia, it sure wasn’t fun to have to stare at my Thor hammer replica while I waited for Kratos and Atreus’ next adventure to download to my PS5 over the course of an entire day. But that’s what happens when you spend hundreds of dollars on physical editions for games that don’t even include a physical copy of the game.</p><p>While there are likely arguments to be made about manufacturing costs and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ask-kotaku-do-you-still-prefer-physical-games-1844822211">growing push for easily erasable digital libraries</a></span> above all else, collector’s editions were always meant to be an extension of a game, not something entirely separate from them. It feels like companies are trying to get around those expectations by not calling these boxes of toys and replicas “collector’s editions,” but we know what these things actually are. I’d be more incentivized to buy your box of cool things if I knew the game that inspired every collectible was also on the way when I got the shipping notification. If nothing else, I guess this saves me from spending too much money on a game I might not even like. Now we’ll see if <em>The Veilguard </em>possesses me to buy another box of shit I have no space for after the fact.</p><p>,</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's still a Halo-style arena shooter with portals, but what has surprised me most about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/" data-ref-id="5000-635888">Splitgate 2</a> is how much <em>more</em> there is to go with that idea. With its new iteration of the game, developer 1047 Games has dialed in elements that help build out the game's identity, complementing what was already there with some new additions that help Splitgate 2 feel different from most other shooters on the market.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its closed alpha, I played Splitgate 2 for about four hours, some of that with other members of the GameSpot crew to field a full squad of four. The preview we played wasn't everything the game will have to offer, but it did provide a solid look at the way new elements are pairing with old ones from the original Splitgate to help give the sequel even more of a specific, unique identity.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, the underlying idea is the same: Splitgate is a free-to-play competitive multiplayer first-person shooter where the arena is covered in special walls, and on those walls, you can place portals. Shoot a portal at one wall and another at a second wall and you create a gateway that lets you enter one and exit the other, instantly traveling across the map. You can also shoot <em>through </em>the portals and chase opponents through their portals, which leads to a ton of fun ideas and chaos among people who know how to use the portals effectively as part of their competitive strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much has changed about the portal element in Splitgate 2, except that 1047 Games has simplified it. Firing a portal is now handled with a single button (rather than using two like the first game). Portals come in two colors--gold and purple--and in the original game, which color portal you fired was determined by its own button, requiring you to shoot both to create a complete pathway but allowing you to do things like "triple portal" by going halfway through one side of a portal and changing its exit by shooting the other to a new place. Splitgate 2 has a new "smart portal system" that does most of that thinking for you, so you can just tap one button and not have to think about the colors so much. Splitgate 2 still allows for closer control of your portals if you need it, and we didn't do much triple portaling in our session to really test the system, but even our limited amount of messing with it suggested that the streamlined approach makes it a lot easier to do fun and ridiculous things with portals.</p><p dir="ltr">The underlying shooter mechanics are a bit on the Halo-ish side; there's no aiming down sights, for instance, but just a short zoom for most weapons, and each arena spawns in power weapons like a rocket launcher or powerful submachine gun that can give one team a significant, if temporary, advantage over the other. The original Splitgate also had some sci-fi elements, like a jetpack that gives you a bit of short-lived verticality to complement your portal abilities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350963" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350963"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350963-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 works with all those underlying elements intact, avoiding messing too much with what already worked. Instead, the sequel fleshes out everything that's not the core gunplay-and-portals idea. Movement is a little faster and more fluid, with more options like a slide ability. You can mod weapons to push one stat or another to match your specific playstyle or approach. And you can now use a light class system to give yourself a specialization on a team, like running-and-gunning or supporting your squad, to add a little variety to the way Splitgate 2 plays--without drastically altering the core feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">It's in those class abilities that Splitgate 2 began to impress. I already liked the main idea of portaling around a map to get into fast and intense firefights, and seeing experts put portals to work alongside Splitgate 2's slides, twitchy jumps, and jetpack bursts is always a bit dazzling. With the class abilities, alongside some adjustments to how game modes work, Splitgate 2 puts a greater emphasis on teamwork, while amplifying the game's tendency to create standout moments and surprising plays. And even in our limited playtime, we saw quite a few of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 sports three classes, referred to as factions in the game, that each have a slightly different focus. The Aeros faction focuses on fast movement and flanking, with a main, short-lived ability that boosts your health over max while increasing your movement speed, a stim that can heal you quickly after a fight, and a disc you can throw at opponents to stun and slow them so you can take advantage of your speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meridian faction mostly plays support, dropping either healing grenades or an area-of-effect dome that speeds up time for you and your team--quickening your fire rates, reload speed, and health regeneration--while slowing down time for your opponents. They also can fire off a wallhack ping that lets you see opponents through walls, which sounds overpowered until you recognize that players can and often are wormholing their way around the map with portals. Finally, the Sebrask faction takes a more militaristic approach, with weapons that fire a little more slowly but hit harder than others, and the ability to throw either a sticky frag grenade or a smoke grenade that can short-circuit portals. Sebrask's main ability is a deployable forcefield that blocks enemy bullets but not friendly ones, giving the class a more defensive posture.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350964" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350964"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350964-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While the different factions all play a little differently from each other, the key elements of how Splitgate works keep them from being too powerful. None of the classes are so strong that you can't drop them in a few shots thanks to Splitgate 2's fairly quick time-to-kill, and even the slowest faction, Sebrask, is still pretty fast. All players use portals, sprinting, jetpacking, and sliding to fight, and while each faction has slightly different options for weapons, passive perks, and abilities, the speed with which you can kill or be killed and your agility in getting around act as solid equalizers.</p><p dir="ltr">The factions do a great job in giving players incentives to work together and take on particular roles on a team, though, and Splitgate 2's best advancement over the original formula is pushing more teamwork and less lone-wolf play. That's done both through the class system and with Splitgate 2's approach to game modes. We only played two modes during the preview session--team deathmatch and Hotzone, Splitgate's take on King of the Hill--but both have been tweaked for both a greater focus on teamwork and to help create breakout gameplay moments.</p><p dir="ltr">In both cases, the game modes are separated into multiple rounds. In deathmatch, that means the first team to score 15 kills wins the round; the match then resets and both teams start again, until one team wins three rounds. The approach tends to give a losing team the chance to regain ground and turn a loss into a win, rather than suffer a lengthy pummeling. It also equalizes the match, since power weapons spawn on the same timer in each round.</p><p dir="ltr">In Hotzone, the round approach heavily pushes teamwork, thanks to adjustments in how teams score points and how respawning works. Like in other King of the Hill game modes in other games, the idea is to hold a specific piece of territory for a set amount of time, with a team scoring a point for "capturing" the territory--three captures wins the round. But unlike in other modes, both teams share a capture timer, meaning one team can sit on a control point for 29 of the required 30 seconds, and the other team can swoop in, kill them, and grab that last second on the timer to get the point. It's a pretty brilliant adjustment to the mode, encouraging teams to either think defensively to hold the zone or try for a last-second, heroic team strike using their portals and abilities in concert.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350970" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350970"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350970-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot5_frontierfpv.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350971,1300-4350972,1300-4350973,1300-4350974" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350971-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot4_ozone.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350972-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithinterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350973-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot_zenithexterior.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4350974-splitgate2rooster_platform_screenshot.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Complicating matters is the respawn timer, which starts at five seconds and then increases over the course of a round to a total of 20 seconds. That cuts players' abilities to just keep throwing themselves at the hotzone over and over, and instead requires coordination in order to make an effective push against an entrenched team. However, if your team racks up kills while you're respawning, the timer gets cut by three seconds with each kill, so there's an incentive to keep fighting. Coupled with the round-based approach, the Hotzone adjustments made for some ridiculous moments in our play session, as well as deflating losses because our team hadn't thought through our strategy and were easily bested by a more-coordinated group.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the play session, Splitgate 2 was a lot of fun, however. It manages the original's feel of being easy to pick up but offering a high skill ceiling, and all the adjustments between the games feel like natural outgrowths of the underlying arena-shooter ideas. Just having portals available in a competitive shooter makes for a lot of chaos. But the adjustments to Splitgate 2's gameplay modes and the addition of team abilities feel like both complements to and checks against the potential for better players to overwhelm you with their cunning use of teleportation and quick movements. It's clear 1047 Games has thought deeply and critically about its game beyond its initial gimmick, and it was surprising how well all the pieces worked together in unison.</p><p dir="ltr">What I liked best about Splitgate 2 was how much of an identity it brings to the competitive shooter space. It harkens back to a very specific era in shooter history and is obviously greatly influenced by games like Halo, Unreal Tournament, and Tribes, but it also feels very different from everything else in the shooter field right now. It's a fast, intense shooter with a lot of great design ideas working in concert, and at least across four hours, it felt like a worthy successor to and an advancement over the original game.</p>

		<p>2022’s bizarre indie hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/trombone-champ/">Trombone Champ</a> is being all its slidey trombone shenanigans to VR later this year, with Trombone Champ: Unflattened set to launch across Meta Quest, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a> and Steam VR this autumn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NCtd5i_qchk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Trombone Champ: Unflattened comes from Flat2VR Studios, a studio that is all about translating flat screen games into virtual reality.</p>
<p>In this case it’s a pretty big reimagining that, instead of having your toot happy Mii-alike character on screen and notes moving from right to left, you will pick up a virtual trombone and actually move the slide around yourself. It is… well, it’s an awful lot closer to playing an actual trombone than you might expect.</p>
<p>The game will feature a playful narrative involving baboons and absurd, laugh-out-loud moments”, while also featuring a slew of weird trombones (including one with a fish replacing the bell), and customisation options to recolour your instrument.</p>

Now, it seems like we may never see it at all. Meta and Rockstar didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The management game progression chart is supposed to go: zoo, then theme park, then hospital, then school. Apparently no one told Springloaded Software, who are following up their 2021 tycoon 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lets-build-a-zoo">Let's Build A Zoo</a> with a game about building an MMO. 
</p>
<p>Let's Build A Dungeon marries the business aspects of Game Dev Tycoon with a more hands-on approach to constructing your company's game, and there's a first trailer below.

<p>Players will need to hire designers, coders and testers to staff their development studio, but also place buildings and trees to populate the fantasy game-within-a-game, as well as filling dungeons with traps and chests to keep virtual players busy and happy and paying their monthly subscription.
</p>
<p>I feel like the quintessential management game anecdote is making the chips more salty in Theme Park so that customers would buy more soda - whether or not that was actually possible in the game - and I hope something similar is true of Let's Build A Dungeon. I want to make the final dungeon boss incredibly difficult to defeat so that players never feel as if they've truly finished the game, until we've added a new dungeon with a new hard boss, and then we can go back and nerf the old one.
</p>
<p>Apparently you can playtest your RPG to experience it as an actual player would, and there's enough of an toolset here that you can also create your own story, dialogue and cutscenes, then share your creation with other real players to try. Wild.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/luma-island-is-a-cozy-adventure-game-for-gamers-of-all-experience-levels<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Different professions offer a different level of challenge.</h2></div><section><p>Luma Island is a cozy adventure game with a unique goal: providing experiences that are enjoyable for lifelong gamers, casual gamers, and first-time gamers. If you’re less experienced or simply want to relax as you build your perfect homestead, you can do that. If you want to take on the challenge of exploring caves and temples, you can do that too. You can play solo or with up to four players in co-op. It’s all up to you.</p><p>That freedom of choice starts right at the beginning of the game. Once you’ve designed your character, you’ll start a new life on Luma Island with nothing but some tools and a small trailer to sleep in. After a quick tutorial, your first major task will be to visit the nearby town to pick your profession. You’ll have seven options to choose from: cook, brewer, treasure hunter, blacksmith, fisherman, jewelrycrafter, and archeologist.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/town-at-night-1723060244991.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This choice is more than just some flavor for your character, it’s an important decision that will determine your character’s goals, some of which are tougher than others. Each profession is clearly labeled with a difficulty level, so you won’t be choosing blindly. Picking a starting profession also doesn’t lock you out of the others. You can be all seven professions if you’d like. Your first choice is free, but from that point on, adding new professions will cost in-game money. If you’re playing co-op, everyone can choose their own separate profession; you’re not locked into following the same path as your friends.</p><p>The easiest professions — such as cook and brewer — are focused on gathering materials on your homestead. You’ll use an axe to gather wood and a pickaxe to gather stone, then use those materials to build craft benches like a sawmill or kiln. You’ll then use these craft benches to turn your wood and stone into more complicated materials, which will then be used to create more advanced recipes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/beginning-farm-1723060244988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Upgrading your tools will make it easier to gather rare materials, which open up even more things you can make. And using a hoe, you can turn patches of grass into farmable land, where you can plant and water seeds to grow crops. That gives you full control over how far your homestead expands.</p><p>This gameplay loop means you’ll consistently have new goals to work toward to master your profession and expand your homestead. If you focus on farming and gathering, you won’t find yourself in dangerous situations very often, making these professions the ideal choice for new gamers or people who want a simple, relaxing experience. You’ll be spending your time gathering, building, planting, and enjoying the game’s vibrant environments and soothing soundtrack.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/heavily-built-farm-during-day-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you’re a more experienced player or are looking for more of a challenge, the hardest professions — such as jewelrycrafter and archeologist — will be more your speed. These professions require searching for loot in Luma Island’s dangerous caves and temples, which have traps and wild animals that will attack on sight. So you’ll need to have a whip at the ready.</p><p>Temples and caves have different rewards and provide different challenges. For example, temples might be full of traps that require you to pay attention to your surroundings. Caves are pitch black and require you to craft torches and strategically place them so you can see where you’re going and where you might get attacked. They each have a different way of keeping you on your toes, but they also hold unique rewards like new blueprints and particularly valuable loot. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/spike-trap-in-a-temple-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you die while in a cave or temple, you’ll lose some of the resources you gathered during that trip. When you enter them, a new section of the HUD will be added that says “lost on death.” As you might expect, you’ll lose the items displayed in that section if you die. Luckily, if you ever get to a point where you want to evacuate a dungeon, each room provides a way for you to escape without having to backtrack all the way to the beginning.</p><p>This temple exploration can also lead you to solve the big mystery of the island. In town, there’s a sealed temple that you need ancient keys to open. Completing temples in each zone will reward you with tablets that will open that zone’s final sanctuary. There, you can find the ancient keys needed to open the sealed temple. What lies within? You’ll just have to figure that out for yourself.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/07/snow-area-1723060244990.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Regardless of what profession you choose, you’ll need some help from magical creatures called Lumas. You get them by finding and hatching Luma Eggs, and there are 15 unique Lumas in the game. Once they’ve hatched, they’ll help you find treasure and provide you with Luma Energy, a resource that is needed for recipes of all professions.</p><p>Ultimately, Luma Island is all about giving you options and letting you choose how you want to play it. Alone, with friends, as one profession, as all of them, or anywhere in between. It’s developed and self-published by indie studio Feel Free Games, will be available on PC, and is planned to release later this year. You can wishlist the game on <u>Steam</u> or join the community on <u>Discord</u>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A fan-made mod that would’ve added Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 content — the 2009 version of the game — to Modern Warfare Remastered on PC has been shut down. And it’s all thanks to Activision.</p>



<p>The H2M mod for Modern Warfare Remastered was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiplayer-mod-mw2-h2m-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to launch</a> on Friday, August 16. However, just a day before the launch, the developers were hit with a Cease &amp; Desist from lawyers representing Activision.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-fallout-london-patch-addresses-british-inconsistencies">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-patch-british/">Fallout: London Patch Addresses British Inconsistencies</a></h6>



<p>“Today, our team members received a Cease &amp; Desist order on behalf of Activision Publishing in relation to the H2M-Mod project,” they <a href="https://x.com/H2Multiplayer/status/1824167247436542167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said on Twitter</a>. We are complying with this order and shutting down all operations immediately and permanently.</p>



<p>The H2M mod was going to add 50 maps to the game along with new attachments and camos for the guns. The mod also included an updated progression system and even Killstreaks from the original Modern Warfare 2.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare Remastered even saw a massive spike in players on Steam thanks to the pending release of the mod. The game had an over 300% increase in daily max players over the last few days compared to a month ago. It <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mw-remastered-top-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even found its way on Steam’s Top Sellers</a> in recent days due to the hype.</p>



<p>Now, it’s likely those players once again turn away from the game with no mod coming.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for clarification on the reasons for sending the Cease &amp; Desist. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>

It begins with her decision to leave her homeland and family to fight the Horde alongside the Alliance in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-ii-tides-of-darkness/" data-ref-id="5000-2298">Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness</a>, depicts her choice to take the fight to enemy as part of the Alliance's expedition into Outland, and ends with her embrace of the Void as a means to defeat Azeroth's enemies--even at the cost of her relationship with her romantic partner, Turalyon.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within | "Alleria: Light and Shadow" Animated Short Film</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Alleria: Light and Shadow is a groundbreaking addition to World of Warcraft's lore, bringing a new level of storytelling to the game's universe," Blizzard says. "Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the lore, this short film offers a captivating glimpse into the character that will play a pivotal role in the upcoming expansion, The War Within."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's focus on Alleria for this expansion, which releases just a few months ahead of WoW's 20th anniversary, is hardly an accident. She's been one of the Warcraft franchise's lead characters almost from the beginning, even if her sister, Sylvanas, became increasingly important over the course of WoW's history. Alleria made her big comeback as part of 2016's Legion expansion, where it was revealed she and Turalyon had joined an intergalactic army of holy warriors dedicated to stamping out the Burning Legion. She's been in the background of WoW ever since, but The War Within will see her once again take the spotlight as she looks to stop the new villain Xal'atath from fulfilling her dark designs.</p><p dir="ltr">While this fully animated short focuses on Alleria, Blizzard also recently released an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brOSi_rpGj4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">animated motion comic</a> highlighting another important character in The War Within, Anusrek, the ruler of the Nerubian kingdom of Azj-Kahet.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">WoW: The War Within releases on August 26</a>, and is slated to be the first expansion in a three-expansion trilogy called The Worldsoul Saga. The expansion's pre-patch has already introduced a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">account-wide progression feature called Warbands</a> to the long-running MMORPG, with other new features, like Delves and Hero Talents, coming in the expansion proper. Those who buy The War Within's epic or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-collectors-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6522721/" data-ref-id="1100-6522721">20th anniversary collector's edition</a> will be able to play four days early starting on August 22.</p>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has announced the official release date for The Elder Scrolls: Castles. The latest installment in the Elder Scrolls series will launch globally on September 10 on mobile devices.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda Game Studios shared a post on its <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1824098856260235507" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official X/Twitter account</a> announcing the release date alongside a video of the director of mobile games, Craig Lafferty, and production director Veronique Bruneau explaining the game. Lafferty describes The Elder Scrolls: Castles as the "spiritual successor to Fallout Shelter." Castles has the same premise as Shelter in the sense that players create their castle, ensuring it runs smoothly and assigning the proper people to the right jobs.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1824098856260235507" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're thrilled to announce that <a href="https://twitter.com/tescastles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TESCastles</a>, our newest mobile game from the team behind Fallout Shelter, will be launching globally on Sept. 10th!<br>We hope you all enjoy this game as much as we've enjoyed working on it.

As time passes, players will see their castle evolve alongside their ruler. How they customize their castle will directly affect how successful they are. Castles will also feature a roguelite mode where players will send their subjects to fight off endless waves of enemies in exchange for rewards. Players can equip enchantments that'll give their people buffs in hopes of them surviving longer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth pointing out that The Elder Scrolls: Castles has been playable for some time now. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-elder-scrolls-game-just-released-out-of-nowhere/1100-6518059/">It was originally shadow-dropped last year</a>.

            <p>
Back in June, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-heads-to-vr-with-series-first-dual-wielding">revealed</a> it was resurrecting and reworking Hitman 3's VR mode, first released for PSVR in 2021, exclusively for Meta Quest 3 - and the studio has now shared first gameplay, showcasing this Reloaded edition's various enhancements.
</p>
<p>
On a basic level, Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded is the same game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-review-a-satisfying-end-to-a-beautiful-stealth-trilogy">earned itself a Eurogamer Recommended badge</a> back in the day, meaning players can don goggles and immersively sneak through likes of Dubai, Dartmoor, Berlin, Chongqing, and Mendoza.
</p>
<p>
However, Reloaded - which is being developed with XR Games - is more than just a straight port of Hitman 3 VR's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-vr-is-more-of-a-hit-than-a-miss-on-psvr">scrappy but enjoyable</a> previous release. It also introduces a new flat-shaded artstyle, more "fluid and natural" movement options, an overhauled UI, and - perhaps most notably - dual-wielding, so players can use a different weapon or item in each hand.

Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll cost £24.99/$29.99 USD when it eventually shows up for Meta Quest 3 later this year.

			<p>Hunt: Showdown 1896 is officially out for players on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game will replace Hunt: Showdown, with those who originally owned Hunt: Showdown being eligible for a free upgrade to Hunt: Showdown 1896. With this update comes many new features that Crytek has implemented to keep the game fresh, including their CRYENGINE 5.11, a new engine dedicated to making this game as visually stunning and immersive as possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hunt: Showdown 1896 I Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16vBsmpcxh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the use of the CRYENGINE 5.11, players can expect to see a new Wild Target for them to hunt and the addition of the Scorched Earth Event, all taking place in the brand-new Colorado biome. In this new update, the story takes the player forward in time and takes everyone west of the bayou. Players will get to find new weapons and get to use Pacts that can help or hinder them.</p>
<p>Those curious about Hunt: Showdown 1896 can jump into the brand-new action for free on PC, with Steam's Free Weekend running from August 15 through August 19. Players can visit the new Colorado map, Mammon's Gulch, where there are 16 unique compounds for players to explore, spread across the peaks of the mountains and down in the mines.</p>
<p>As previously announced, players will get to take on the latest Wild Target: The Hellborn. It's an amalgam of fire and flesh and can be tracked audibly by listening in Dark Sight. The new Wild Target is highly aggressive and moves frantically while throwing slag at nearby Hunters, scorching everything within its grasp.</p>
<p>However, there comes a huge risk with the Hellborn, as its screeches will draw the attention of the other Hunters, adding another level of threat.</p>
<p>Staying on trend with the Hellborn is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-introduces-hellborn-in-scorched-earth-event/">Scorched Earth event</a>, from August 15 through October 7. Players can explore more of the Mammon's Gulch story by participating in the event to earn new equipment, ammo, and weapons. This includes the 1865 Carbine, the Infantry 73L base rifle with a sniper variant, Bear Traps, and many more.</p>
<p>In addition, Crytek has also added a Weekly Challenge system to Hunt: Showdown 1896 to support players joining mid-event, as well as a Battle Pass with a free and premium track, allowing players to unlock rewards throughout the event.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/594650/announcements/detail/4326355263804047483" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam community page</a>, you can read all about the changes made in Hunt: Showdown, including the full stats list of the new weapon variants made available in the event.</p>

			<p>ARK series <a href="https://wccftech.com/myth-of-empires-to-be-re-released-in-early-2024-as-snail-games-becomes-its-publisher-following-legal-dispute/">publisher Snail Games</a> has announced their latest project, a new "open universe" AAA title named For The Stars. This space-themed sandbox survival game implores you to explore several diverse worlds and research technologies while using a customizable spacecraft. Not only that, but players will get to battle space pirates and other creatures across the planets.</p>
<p>Off the bat, the game sounds very similar to No Man's Sky, as there will be plenty of planet-hopping as an explorer and scientist, uncovering secrets of alien civilizations and finding rare creatures that inhabit the planets. While you uncover these secrets, they will help you survive the deadly biomes you encounter.</p>
<p>In For The Stars, you can play in a persistent multiplayer universe, where you must establish a base and expand your outposts across the cosmos while working to survive and conquer the hostile biomes surrounding you. To make your journey easier, you can forge alliances with others you come across in multiplayer.</p>
<p>With your spacecraft, you can design it and build it to your specifications, with each ship being able to be tailored to your specific needs by using the resources you salvage across planets and the technology you research. You can have ships dedicated to combat, resource gathering, or simply exploring uncharted territories.</p>
<p>Whether you want to play passively and dedicate yourself to research and exploring uncharted lands or be aggressive and engage in fast-paced combat using futuristic weapons and abilities, there is a play style for everyone.</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to finally officially announce For The Stars after three years of development," says Primus Majda, Game Director of For The Stars. "We are gamers first and foremost. We love survival games and Snail has a lot of experience with them. We have an ambitious game in mind, and we are taking what we've learned from other projects to make it happen. Our goal is to create a game that's played like a sandbox survival game but has the impact of a 4x galaxy civilization game."</p>

<p>Snail Games USA is an independent global developer and publisher of digital entertainment. It has been successfully growing and creating great projects since 2009, leveraging technology and innovation in every step.</p>
<p>At the moment, For The Stars doesn't have a definitive release date<span>; the&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1415230/For_The_Stars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a> only says</span> "coming soon." However, when this ambitious space-themed sandbox game emerges, it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

One of these new games is seemingly focused on the big ape himself, King Kong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skull-island-king-kong-worst-game-2023-gollum-switch-1850933945&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skull-island-king-kong-worst-game-2023-gollum-switch-1850933945">Let’s all hope it’s better than that <em>last </em>King Kong game...</a></span></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192849" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Bayonetta 3’s Kaiju Are A Spectacular New Addition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="192849,196923,196922" data-current="192849"><div><p>Bayonetta 3’s Kaiju Are A Spectacular New Addition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192849/192849_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18311.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsterverse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsterverse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsterverse</a></span>, which is a name I only see used in press releases, started off with 2014’s <em>Godzilla</em>.

And now the Monsterverse is expanding once more, this time into the interactive wonderland that is video games. </p><p>On August 15, Legendary Pictures announced that it plans to launch three different games based on the <em>Godzilla/Kong</em> universe. Now, before you get too excited, know that one of these games is a mobile thing that looks...fine. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmS8vGjuyKD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmS8vGjuyKD" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">It’s now available to pre-order</a></span> on Android and iOS. </p><p>Another game will exist in <em>Roblox </em>and will, Legendary states in a press release, let fans “experience” a “unique virtual world where players can engage with the Monsterverse in innovative ways.” So expect to run around completing crappy mini-games while collecting a currency to unlock some in-game cosmetics and maybe watch a trailer. This <em>Roblox </em>game is coming out later this year. </p><h2 id="h11313"><a id=""></a>A new King Kong game is set to launch later this year</h2><p>The big news from today’s announcement is the third game, <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em>. According to Legendary and developer 7Levels, this new Kong game is a “2.5D action-adventure game for PC and consoles.” It’s set shortly after the events of <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> and sees players taking on the role of a father looking for his missing daughter while exploring a “shattered city.”</p><p>All three of these Monsterverse games are planned to arrive before the end of the year. No trailer or screenshots were released for <em>Kong: Survivor Instinct</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/7lvls/status/1824133304334876673&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/7lvls/status/1824133304334876673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but the devs did post a teaser image on Twitter</a></span>.<br></p><p> “The opportunity to work on the hugely popular Monsterverse IP has been an exciting and formative experience for all of us at 7Levels,”  said Paweł Biela, a co-founder of the studio. “Not only did we have a chance to show some of the fan-favorite Titans from a unique perspective, but we also found committed and supportive partners in the exceptional people at Legendary.”</p><p>So it sounds like this game won’t have you running around as King Kong or Godzilla, but will instead focus on a human trying to survive a monster attack. That sounds interesting! It certainly sounds like it could be better than that last King Kong game. </p><p><em>Skull Island: Rise of Kong </em>was released last year to horrible reviews from players. It was a disaster with awful visuals, bad gameplay, and ugly cutscenes. </p><p>It should be noted that the folks who worked on that game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/king-kong-skull-island-bad-game-worst-2023-1850946332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/king-kong-skull-island-bad-game-worst-2023-1850946332">reportedly got little support from publisher Game Mill</a></span> and had to crunch for months to get <em>Rise of Kong</em> out the door on time. The end result: A very, very bad game. Hopefully, Legendary gives 7Levels the time and resources they need to make something much better.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-separating-warzone-from-call-of-duty-releases.954414/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/activision-separating-warzone-from-call-of-duty-releases/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When you download Call of Duty moving forward, you wont have to download Warzone at the same time. According to a new post from Activision, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-optimizing-experience-roadmap#Separating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">publisher has announced</a> that it will be separating Warzone from Call of Duty games moving forward.</p>



<p>“To give players more control over what they’re downloading, we are decoupling the download of&nbsp;Call of Duty: Warzone&nbsp;from other titles,” Activision said. “When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default.”</p>



<p>That means if you want to download Warzone, you will have to do it as a separate download. This will not only decrease the time it takes to download Call of Duty before you can play, but will also free up prime real estate on your storage devices.</p>







<p>“Flexibility and choice matter,” they said. “We want to give players the choice to download each Call of Duty, including&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, when and how they wish.”</p>



<p>This separation will happen starting Wednesday, August 21. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-vault-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on October 25</a>, and will be the first game in the franchise to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release Day One on Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>Collegiate esports is voluntarily becoming incredibly popular amongst the younger generation, as many schools are beginning to offer full-ride scholarships in exchange for a student’s gaming abilities. Many schools already operate in their own esports league, competing for massive prize pools. Now, though, eight of the nation’s leading universities have established a new conference, bringing collegiate esports to a new level.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-leading-universities-establish-new-esports-conference">8 Leading Universities Establish New Esports Conference</h2>



<p>Eight leading universities in the US have banded together to establish a new esports conference titled, the <strong>Power Esports Conference (PEC)</strong>. The league will consist of eight Division 1 schools competing against each other across four separate game titles.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-universities-in-the-power-esports-conference">All Universities In The Power Esports Conference:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Boise State University</li>



<li>Michigan State University</li>



<li>Syracuse University</li>



<li>Ohio State University</li>



<li>University of Kansas</li>



<li>University of Missouri</li>



<li>University of Nebraska</li>



<li>University of Southern California</li>
</ul>



<p>“We are proud to help form the Power Esports Conference, a first-of-its-kind collaboration to create memorable and meaningful competitive opportunities for our students, alumni, and partners,” said Christopher Bilski, Director of Esports at Michigan State University. “This conference brings together like-minded institutions to highlight some of the best and brightest in collegiate esports and is a positive step forward in continuing to grow esports opportunities at Michigan State University.”</p>

<p>So many storylines already resonate so heavily within the collegiate esports world. Now, adding such a big conference into the mix, the stakes will be even higher.</p>



<p>“We are elated to help establish this conference and play peer institutions in a fixed season schedule that expands upon our traditional athletic rivalries. The PEC will be a great addition to the other leagues and publisher tournaments that make for a great student experience,” said Dr. Chris Haskell, Head Coach of Esports at Boise State University.</p>



<p>So, when will the season start? And what games will students be competing in?</p>







<h2 id="h-season-start-date-and-all-games-involved-in-the-conference">Season Start Date And All Games Involved In The Conference</h2>



<p>The beginning of the PEC season is September 23, 2024, giving gamers just enough time to prepare for quite the historical first competitive season. With some of the biggest games in esports involved, students should prepare for some intense action.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-games-in-the-power-esports-conference">All Games In The Power Esports Conference:</h4>



<ul>
<li>Valorant</li>



<li>Overwatch 2</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</li>
</ul>



<p>While there are only four games in the PEC, we could easily see more added to the list if the first season or two shows to be successful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-working-on-custom-call-of-duty-download-options-ahead-of-black-ops-6-to-tackle-colossal-file-sizes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Promising "a new streamlined interface."</h2></div><section><p>Activision will soon let players install different parts of Call of Duty games separately to combat colossal file sizes ahead of the release of Black Ops 6.</p><p>Call of Duty, with its various evolving modes like Multiplayer and Zombies alongside yearly releases on top of separate games like Warzone, has gotten a bit messy and, dare we say, chunky in recent years. Black Ops 6 gained attention when players thought it required around 300GB of download space to install, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-isnt-300-gb-after-all">and while this turned out not to be true</a>, it created such a reaction because it was somewhat believable.</p><p>File sizes for the various games can reach well above 100GB, a significant portion of some consoles' hard drives, but Activision is now determined to quell this issue.</p><p>Changes will be rolled out in a number of updates in the coming months, in anticipation of Black Ops 6's launch on October 25, 2024. They aim to offer a streamlined interface, direct access to games, more control of downloads, and expanded streaming technology to reduce file sizes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/cod-1723739696024.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"These changes will be rolled out in phases as a series of downloads," Activision said. "After these larger initial updates, future Call of Duty downloads will decrease in size and existing files will take up less space on your device. As a thanks for your patience, we're gifting all players with in-game consumables, which will be delivered when you first log into Call of Duty after the Season 5 Reloaded update."</p><p>Activision confirmed the immediate effect of these changes: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a smaller download than Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III at launch.</p><p>The first big update arrives August 21 and will pave the way for these larger changes, headlined by the separation of Call of Duty: Warzone and the mainline games. "To give players more control over what they’re downloading, we are decoupling the download of Call of Duty: Warzone from other titles," Activision said.</p><p>"When you purchase an annual title, you will only download the files for that game by default. On the free to play side, players can opt-in to get Call of Duty: Warzone when they’re downloading a new annual title or simply download it separately at any point in time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Subsequent updates will arrive August 30, in mid October, on October 25 when Black Ops 6 launches, and alongside that game's Season 1 update, whenever it may be.</p><p>Not trying to hide that this will be an awkward, somewhat confusing, and perhaps tedious time for players, Activision is giving away a pack of Battle Token Tier Skips and 2XP tokens from the beginning of Season 5 Reloaded.</p><p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty</a> blog.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-and-more-leaked-via-xboxs-own-website">Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, 2024</a>. Other multiplayer mode will be available to try a bit earlier though, thanks to an early access period beginning in late August. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-confirmed">An invite only trial takes place</a> on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, and PC from August 30 to September 4, while an open beta takes place September 6 to September 9.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
