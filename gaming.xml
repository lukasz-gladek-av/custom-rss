            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developers Game Science have revealed Black Myth: Zhong Kui, another single-player action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> steeped in Chinese mythology. It casts you as a ghost-hunting god who wanders between hell and Earth. Here's a CG short from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom's Open Night Live 2025</a>, which shows the fearsomely bearded Zhong Kui himself riding an extravagantly sized tiger. </p><!--more-->

<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">a Q&amp;A on the official site</a>, the developers call the game a "tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design". They want Wukong players to feel "right at home" while "catching them off guard in the best way". That said, for now the new game remains "little more than an empty folder", with no release date and little sense in the CG trailer of how Zhong Kui fights, compared to Wukong. I'm guessing that tiger is a useful ally, though.</p>
<p>We quite liked the original Black Myth, with bygone reviews editor Ed Thorn (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">calling it</a> "a refreshing adventure after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s knotty DLC". We were less keen on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukongs-record-setting-launch-popularity-soured-by-co-publisher-request-to-avoid-feminist-propaganda-in-streams">the mildly draconian PR messages</a> to certain streamers, cautioning them to avoid "feminist propaganda", "politics" and discussion of the Chinese games industry.</p><p>These gamergatory memos followed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">a lengthy report from IGN</a> about alleged workplace sexism at Game Science. The devs refused to say anything to Ed about this when he asked at a preview event. If we're invited to preview Zhong Kui, we'll give it another shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's Gamescom Opening Night Live broadcast has given us a fresh look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> protagonist Grace Ashcroft, but no sign of fan-favorite Leon S. Kennedy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As expected, today's show brought with it a deeper dive into Capcom's hotly-anticipated upcoming survival horror (which is also playable here at Gamescom). Footage once again showed the game's new star Grace Ashcroft in action, though fans were left wondering about Leon's whereabouts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a phone call from unknown voice, Grace Ashcroft and her mom Alyssa attempt to escape from the hotel in which they had been staying, as the power is cut and the pair are attacked. We already know what happens next, as Grace is seen investigating the hotel years later, as an FBI analyst.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom previously promised that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">Requiem will feature a return to the series' "overarching narrative"</a> begun 30 years ago, after more recent games such as Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village focused on events set elsewhere, with fewer connections to past titles. Already, fans had noted the return of Raccoon City and references to the shadowy Umbrella Corporation, while hoping for more, including a first sighting of Leon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi previously said</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans took this comment to mean that Leon was still in the game somewhere, likely in sequences that offered more action-orientated gameplay, as while stating the character wouldn't be suitable for horror sections, Nakanishi notably stopped short of ruling the character out altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty of time still until Resident Evil Requiem eventually launches, on February 27, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom and Square Enix took the stage at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</u></a> to show off a new collaboration that will see <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> collide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto and Final Fantasy 14 Online Producer and Director Naoki Yoshida (a.k.a. Yoshi-P) showed up to talk about how two of gaming’s biggest publishers are working to bring some of their biggest franchises together. Two new trailers (below) revealed only a taste of what to expect, including Monster Hunter-themed content for Final Fantasy 14 and Final Fantasy-themed content for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Final Fantasy 14 content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds kicked off the announcement with a look at how Hunters will be able to use Chocobo to travel during hunts. It's a trailer that also teases appearances from familiar elements like Cactuar as the Capcom team tells players to prepare for "an Omega level threat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/monsterhunterwilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> the Monster Hunter Wilds content coming to Final Fantasy 14, on the other hand, will see players "face an unknown threat in this thrilling new hunt." Its trailer shows off some of the new content you'll be able to enjoy, but there is a catch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to participate in the Monster Hunter Wilds-themed update, you'll need to reach level 100 in Final Fantasy 14 and complete its Dawntrail main scenario quest. It's far from a simple feat to achieve and could take new players potentially hundreds of hours to pull off (according to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/12654" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If a Monster Hunter fan were to jump into Final Fantasy 14 for the first time today, they could spend around 400 hours working their way through all of the required content. Alternatively, Square Enix's long-running live-service game offers paid options for those who want to skip their way past any entry barriers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Using a Tales of Adventure item to skip to level 90 for any one character costs $25 alone, and a second Tales of Adventure item to then skip to Dawntrail also costs $25. That's $50 to go from level 1 to almost meeting the requirements to unlock the Monster Hunter Wilds content, with players then asked to complete the final 10 levels and see Dawntrailer to its conclusion. <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/132429" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Howlongtobeat</a> estimates that it should take players about 48 hours to beat this one Final Fantasy 14 chapter on its own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds players can expect the new content to arrive in late September as part of Free Title Update 3. Final Fantasy 14 players, meanwhile, can expect to receive their content in early October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more updates, be sure to read up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at gamescom Opening Night Live 2025</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-midnight-takes-players-back-to-a-refreshed-quelthalas-in-the-battle-against-the-void.1275030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">At Gamescom Opening Night Live, we just got a look at the opening cinematic for the next World of Warcraft expansion: Midnight. And with it, we got a taste of what to expect at the focal point of the expansion's start: Quel'Thalas, and the Blood Elf city of Silvermoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a WoW veteran, you probably know Quel'Thalas. It was introduced to World of Warcraft in the first expansion, The Burning Crusade, alongside the introduction of the Blood Elves. Currently in the game, in consists of Silvermoon City and the surrounding Eversong Woods, as well as the northern Isle of Quel'Danas and The Ghostlands to the south. Though it's largely populated by Blood Elves, it's also home to Zul'Aman, the home of the Amani Trolls. As it stands now, Silvermoon and everything to the south serves as a starting zone for low-level Blood Elves (though it's also largely been made obsolete due to the addition of the ubiquitous new player experience, Exile's Reach), while Quel'Danas was an endgame zone in patch 2.4 that's largely useless now if you don't have a very specific reason to be there.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is about to change. As we saw in the cinematic, Midnight opens with void menace and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-no-everyone-in-world-of-warcraft-is-falling-for-the-hot-evil-lady-who-will-definitely-try-and-kill-us-later">total baddie Xal'atath</a> attacking the Sunwell, a magical power fountain in Quel'Danas that's sacred to the Blood Elves. We're headed there at the start of Midnight to defend it (alongside the thankfully-not-dead Blood Elf leader, Lor'themar Theron), which means that whole area is getting an overhaul. Midnight starts with four zones: a reworked Eversong Woods (which also seems like it will include at least some of Ghostlands), a reworked Zul'Aman (now upgraded from a raid to a full zone), and two new areas: the rootlands of Harandar, and Voidstorm, which seems to be located in a different world entirely. Players will start in Eversong Woods and end in Voidstorm, with Zul'Aman and Harandar able to be done interchangeably.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies to the Draenei, though. Burning Crusade's equivalent Alliance class starting zones, Azuremyst and Bloodmyst Isle, and the Draenei hub The Exodar, don't appear to be getting any special treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike recent expansions, Midnight will open with not one, but three raids: The Voidspire (six bosses), The Dreamrift (one boss), and March on Quel'Danas (two bosses). World of Warcraft hasn't had multiple raids running at once for several expansions now, so having three at once at launch is a big deal. The expansion also launches with eight new dungeons (including a reworked Magister's Terrace), seven new delves, and a new PvP battleground. There's also a brand new feature called "Prey" where players hunt powerful targets across different world zones, with the potential to be ambushed while on the hunt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">World of Warcraft: Midnight Cinematic Images and First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for characters, we're not getting any brand new classes. A new allied race, Haranir, will be available, alongside a new mid-range Demon Hunter specialization and Void Elves now also able to become Demon Hunters. There are also some overhauls to the new player experience including new story mode raids for Dragonflight and some other catch-up features. And they're simplifying skyriding, including (thank goodness) getting rid of the vigor bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the biggest and most exciting feature of Midnight is one we already know about: player housing. We've already heard and seen a lot about what to expect from housing, but Blizzard has re-confirmed that we're getting fully customizable player homes, with 3D placement tools, dyes to recolor furniture, all sorts of decor items available to be earned through all different kinds of content, and private and public neighborhoods. No <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-takes-a-jab-at-final-fantasy-14-with-its-housing-plans">fighting over plots</a> like in Final Fantasy 14, either!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're expecting to hear more details about what we'll see in Midnight throughout Gamescom, so stay tuned to IGN for more on World of Warcraft's latest. Midnight launches in 2026. You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

You’re a brilliant but tormented operant on a desperate assignment. Pick up the pieces of your broken network, untangle a bloody web of intrigue at the End of History, and prove yourself on the big stage or blow it all up—again.</p><p><strong>A Spy Like No Other</strong></p><p>Brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed—you play as operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE. Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you’ve been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Welcome to the End of History</strong></p><p>Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In ZERO PARADES, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Trust is a Volatile Plaything</strong></p><p>To get anywhere in this world, you’ll need friends. Unfortunately, you don’t have any. Instead, you’ll go up against international bankers, foreign techno-fascists, psychic doppelgängers, a paranoid TV presenter, a man with a box for a heart, and dozens more. Everyone you meet has their own agendas, beliefs, and secrets for you to uncover and turn to your own ends.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_985862"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Make It Up as You Go Along</strong></p><p>In this line of work you’re going to fail *way* more often than you succeed. That much is expected of you. What matters is how you pick yourself back up. As an operant, your dice are in the hand of fate. If they don’t go your way (and they won’t), you’ll have to improvise and hope the consequences are ones you can live with.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Become an Anti-Icon</strong> – Play as Hershel—brilliant, relentless, magnetic… and cursed. A former top operant whose touch turns everything to ash. She is as dangerous to her enemies as she is to her friends.</li><li><strong>Espionage Reinvented</strong> – Descend into a world of bootleg mind-erasure, failed space programmes, and state-sponsored pop stars. This is espionage stripped of glamour—no parades, no happy endings – at least probably not for you.</li><li><strong>Failing Forward</strong> – In the life of an operant, failure is inevitable. Here, it’s another way forward – every misstep opens doors that success would run swiftly by.</li><li><strong>A Story-Rich Espionage RPG</strong> – From the studio which brought you <em>Disco Elysium</em>. Blending the psychological depth of a spy novel with surrealist undertones and richly drawn characters.</li><li><strong>A <a title="Companies > Question [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/question">Question</a> of Identity</strong> – Who are you when no one is watching? Or, at least, when you *think* no one is? In ZERO PARADES, the answer will define much more than just the assignment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> Opening Night Live time, and that means <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s back and ready to dish out loads of gaming news and information. As part of the presentation, Keighley and the crew behind Opening Night Live took to the stage with brand-new trailers, announcements, reveals, and more, kicking off this year's Gamescom event in Germany. You'll find a complete list of everything announced during the showcase below.</p>
<p><strong>A new trailer for </strong><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7"><strong>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>
<p>First up, there was a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> Black Ops 7. The trailer, set in the year of 2035, showed a world under the grip of terrorism, where militarised police and soldiers take to the battlefield in both the real world and what appears to simulated, topsy-turvy versions of Los Angeles, Angola, Tokyo, Alaska, and somewhere called Avalon (a 'living, breathing space that evolves with the player', per the devs).</p>
<p>The trailer also seemed to tease some sort of Zombies mode called 'Arcade Zombies' which is a top-down, action-RPG style experience that'll be added to this year's CoD. You'll be playing as series veteran David Mason, who's deployed alongside the 'Guild', a tech-startup inspired group that apparently calls itself 'humanity's last stand'. Hm.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing about today's news is that Activision confirmed you'll be able to play the whole story either single-player, or with up to three other people. There's an emphasis on freedom in this campaign, and that's when it comes to narrative, gameplay, movement or whatever else. It certainly seems like a drastic move for the series, and I'm pretty intrigued.</p>
<p>More information will be revealed at Call of Duty Next, which takes place on September 30th, 2025. The game is set to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-suggests-theres-still-no-nintendo-switch-2-version-at-launch">on 14th November 2025.</a></p>

<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2 gets a reveal trailer</strong></p>
<p>Next up, we got a cinematic trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</a>, a sequel to 2023's title by Hexworks and CI Games. It's dark fantasy through and through, with your armoured knight character going toe-to-toe with an angelic fo against the backdrop of a crumbling Medieval world. The game is set 100 years after the last one, as the barrier between the living and the dead begins to tear.</p>
<p>It'll also be "bloodier, faster and more brutal than ever", promise the devs. We'll get more gameplay later this year.</p>

<p><strong>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is getting an anime</strong></p>
<p>Next up, Geoff <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation">showed off a trailer for Sekiro: No Defeat</a>. The anime is heading exclusively to Crunchyroll and is directed by Kenichi Kutsuna, with character design by Takahiro Kishida.</p>
<p>"We are taking on the monumental task of animating the breathtakingly beautiful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a>. In doing so, we are pouring every ounce of our artistic vision and passion for beauty into its production," said Kutsuna. "The final product is being crafted to be a truly memorable experience, one that will leave a lasting impression on both dedicated fans of the game and those who are discovering the world of Sekiro for the very first time. Please look forward to it."</p>

<p><strong>Lego Batman returns with Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</strong></p>
<p>Lego Batman - not voiced by Will Arnett any more, apparently - returned with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-batman-is-back-in-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-and-its-out-next-year">goofy new Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, packed to the cowl with little references to the series at large: the Penguin, Joker, Catwoman, the Batmobile, Bane and more were there (and it sounds like Matt Berry is voicing Bane?!)</p><p>Per the developer, Legacy of the Dark Knight covers Bats' whole career, from Origins to legend. There's decades of lore here, and it looks like the studio has taken the best moments from games, comics, TV shows, and more in order to make a proper love-letter to the IP as a whole. I wouldn't expect anything less from the Lego games, though. You can also drive about an open-world Gotham in "your choice of Batmobile". Cool.</p>
<p>Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is being developed by TT Games, and there's a demo on the show floor. A release date was not mentioned.</p>

<p><strong>Dawn of War 4 announced, gets a cinematic trailer</strong></p>
<p>Warhammer is on a roll right now. Whether it's Rogue Trader or Space Marine 2, the IP is having a real moment both in miniatures and video games. Today, that strength continues, with a big (and pretty good-looking) new trailer for Dawn of War 4. We've got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-and-its-coming-from-a-surprise-new-developer-next-year">way more information on our dedicated page</a>.</p><p>Following the story of the Blood Marines, the cinematic trailer showed the brutal marines dispatching enemies (Orks and Nekron, mostly) against the backdrop of that grimdark sci-fi universe that should be recognisable even to those that don't engage with Warhammer.</p>
<p>Dawn of War 4 is coming to PC in 2026.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.de/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a><strong> gets a Final Fantasy 14 crossover (and vice versa) </strong></p>
<p>It's no Seikret that everyone thought the ridable mount in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> felt a bit like a chocobo from the Final Fantasy franchise; a mountable bird that is intelligent and dangerous in its own right? It's basically IP theft! Well, go figure - both franchises are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">collaborating to bring a touch of Final Fantasy 14's Eorza to the world of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p>After first collaborating with Monster Hunter World, this promises to be a large crossover. We're getting the chocobo skins for our Seikrets, sure, but we're also getting a new monster to fight in the form of Omega Planetes, a mechanised beast that shares the name of a series-long villain in the Final Fantasy series. We didn't see much about the fight during the show, but if the Behemoth in Monster Hunter World is anything to go by, it'll be pretty brutal.</p>
<p>This collaboration works both ways: FF14 will let you replace your mount with a Seikret, and it looks like the MMO will be introducing Arkveld (the 'end-game' baddy from MH Wilds) as an encounter. It'll most likely be a raid. I think you may also be able to turn your Palico into a Cactuar, too? That's the real highlight.</p>

I have a full preview (hands-on!) coming for you tomorrow, so expect to hear more then.</p>

<p><strong>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion gets a free Switch 2 demo</strong></p>
<p>Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion now has a free demo available for users on all platforms, but the one I'm most intrigued about is Switch 2. The demo is available to download now, allowing you to play through the first nine chapters of the story and roam the open world. That's pretty generous for a demo. Even better, all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on 5th September 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Fallout Season 2 sets the world on fire, gets a proper release date </strong></p>
<p>So, we're going to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>. After dealing with a lot of 'family struggles' in their own right, the showrunners noted they wanted to send Lucy and the Ghoul to 'one of the most family friendly places on earth'. Will Lucy transform the Ghoul, or will the Ghoul transform Lucy? That's the core point of the tension this season. The assembled actors and producers on stage also pushed a bit into Maximus' lore, and teased a journey for him as he steps gently into his role of a knight in the Brotherhood of Steel.</p><p>Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Season 2</a> is diving more into New Vegas - a place explored well in the video game - we're also going to see some more crossovers with the game. So, say hello to Mr. House, as he appears in his human form. We even get a VATS-style slow-mo shot of Lucy shooting a gun, and our first glimpse of a Deathclaw as it appears in the show.</p>
<p>Fallout season two comes to Amazon Prime Video on 17th December, 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Deadpool VR</strong> is coming to Meta Quest 3 (launching in December), <strong>World of Tanks</strong> gets its biggest update ever with World of Tanks 2.0 (coming in September), we got a new trailer for <strong>John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</strong> ahead of its release date in 'early 2026' (which had some of the best music in the whole show), and then Ron Gilbert - creator of Monkey Island and Manic Mansion - took to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Death by Scrolling brings back an industry legend</strong></p>
<p>It's a vertically-scrolling RPG-cum-roguelike that sees you struggling through purgatory to stay one step ahead of the Grim Reaper herself. There are five playable characters with their own unique perks, and the gameplay looks like a mix of Vampire Survivors, Enter the Gungeon, and classic Zelda. Yeah, I'm sold.</p>

<p><strong>Studio ZA/UM shows off its first game since Disco Elysium</strong></p>
<p>A cinematic trailer is never really going to be able to capture what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is, or can be, but let's put that aside for now as we look at ZA/UM's new game, Zero Parades. A moody trailer shows off concept art, a very small bit of gameplay, and some voiceover that promises to be as moody and cerebral as the original game. Described as an 'espionage RPG', you play as Hershel Wilk - or CASCADE - who has been sent on a mysterious assignment. You'll need to make the acquaintance of various people at the end of history, each with their own agendas.</p><p>Of course, most of the original developers have left the studio at this point, so any ties to Disco Elysium is more down to developer name than shared DNA. It's too early to tell what this game will be like, but, from the trailer, it seems ZA/UM is at least keeping the <em>vibe</em> alive. It's all about "failing forward", apparently. But I won't make a comment about that.</p>
<p>You can wishlist the game now on Steam.</p>

<p>Next was another block of little trailers. There was <strong>Unbeatable</strong>, a stunning looking game where "music is illegal, and you do crimes". It's an anime-inspired rhythm game that is developed by D-CELL Games and published by PlayStack. It's coming to Steam and consoles in November. We also saw trailers for a new anime gacha game, <strong>Neverness to Everness</strong>, and a boss battle for <strong>Honor of Kings World</strong>. These were followed by a new trailer for Delta Force, which launches today on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

<p><strong>Ninja Gaiden 4 gets a story trailer</strong></p>
<p>Platinum Games showed off a new trailer for Ninja Gaiden 4 that featured some bloody and intense gameplay, but also dipped a bit deeper into the story and lore of the new game. The most notable thing was probably the cybernetically-enhanced skills that most of the ninja and enemies seemed to be rocking. But the real star of the show is the combat; fluid, bloody, and brutal. It looks good.</p><p>Time for another sizzle reel. This time we got Cinder City and Time Takers. Both from NCsoft, this was our first-ever look at the gameplay for Time Takers, and it revealed a team-based third-person shooter which brings together a group of rogues from across time to fix their past. Standard. Think Overwatch x Apex Legends. Cinder City is your standard MMO fare, and lands on 21st October.</p>

<p><strong>Silent Hill f gets a brand-new trailer</strong></p>
<p>And just like that, we're in old Japan: alone, tiptoeing around some creepy wooden buildings. And then she's gone into some other dimension. Per the trailer, Suzie Yeung provides the English voice of the main character. And she wields a naginata to fend off the undead hordes that have come to drag her kicking and screaming into the underworld. It's all very Silent Hill, and we can learn more when we get our hands on the game on 25th September.</p>

<p>There'll be three biomes to explore on its initial debut, each including "unique enemies", so keep your wits about you. When players return from these biomes, there will be plenty of relics to then sell in Will's shop.</p>
<p>"Set prices, serve customers, customise your space, and experience most of the story - all built around an updated combat system featuring four main weapons, nearly 100 shop and dungeon perks, and a smoother, improved feel," the blurb reads.</p>

<p>Resident Evil: Requiem protagonist Grace Ashcroft got a bit of fleshing out in the latest trailer for Capcom's storied franchise, but there is still no sign of fan-favorite and series stalwart, Leon S. Kennedy. After receiving a phone call from mysterious stranger, Grace Ashcroft and her mum panic and attempt to escape from the building they're staying in, only to witness a brutal murder as people chase the duo down.</p><p>It's all a bit of a teaser for the promise Capcom has made to return to the series' "overarching narrative", as we go a little closer to home and the origins of Raccoon City and the Umbrella Corp. There is more to come in my hands-on preview of the game, which drops tomorrow at noon.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on 27th February, 2026.</p>

The developer clearly doesn't want to stray too far away from what has been successful in the past, as this newly-announced title will be another single-player action-RPG, rooted in Chinese folklore. If it ain't broke, as they say.</p>
<p>A brief teaser trailer was aired during Gamescom Opening Night Live, showing a couple of men hiding from a parade of mythical characters, including Zhong Kui himself, who was riding a giant tiger.</p>
<p>"Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design," say the developers in a Q&amp;A.</p><p>"Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets. And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong: the westward journey won't end here."</p>
<p>Black Myth: Zhong Kui has no release date yet, but promises to launch on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Amazon have announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/20/fallout-season-2-confirmed-sony-paramount/">which was commissioned just a week after the first </a>had aired, finds Lucy (Ella Purnell), Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and Maximus (Aaron Moten) as they travel to New Vegas in an attempt to catch up with Lucy’s father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan).</p>
<p>Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.&nbsp; Barb, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, will also join the cast, and most excitingly, according to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32158505/?ref_=tt_eps_nx">IMDB, Dogmeat</a> will be in the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout – Season Two Teaser Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TsP09cZA7o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer reveals that fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, and he has a connection to Ghoul, or more specifically, Cooper Howard, the pre-war era actor who eventually became Ghoul. There is also a tease of a Deathclaw right at the end and lots of head popping gory action, just like the first series.</p>
<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue.</p>

<p>The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-launch-scheduled-for-exactly-one-year-after-pc-ps5/">Black Myth: Wukong</a> developer Game Science has announced Black Myth: Zhong Kui, the next game in its Black Myth series, coming to PC and "<em>mainstream console platforms"</em> sometime in the future, as a specific release date was not announced.</p>



<p>On the game's <a href="https://gamesci.cn/zhongkui">official website</a>, Game Science makes a few things clear to Black Myth: Wukong fans who potentially have a flurry of questions in their minds about Zhong Kui.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Myth: Zhong Kui World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwYZ7xC2v80?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Firstly, Zhong Kui is the next game in Game Science's Black Myth series, but it is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong. As to why Game Science isn't just rushing to show off Black Myth: Wukong 2, in an FAQ for Zhong Kui, it wrote, "<em>Upon completing the journey with the Destined One, we now aspire to take a tentative first step - to build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features, and to bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Zhong Kui came as a natural choice born of that aspiration and other contributing factors. We are confident that, in this new project, we can make refreshing changes, create new things, while taking a hard look at our past flaws and regrets.</em>"</p>



<p>The studio does also confirm that the choice to reveal Zhong Kui first doesn't mean it's the end for Wukong, as it closes by saying, "<em>And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won't end here</em>."</p>



<p>But even though Game Science is debuting Zhong Kui before it shows off Wukong 2, it is also very clear in communicating that this game is very, very early in development. Regarding Zhong Kui's story, Game Science admits that it's "<em>not even done with the outline yet</em>," and also calls the project "<em>little more than an empty folder at this stage</em>." Which it explains is also why the debut trailer isn't gameplay, but instead just a CG short "<em>to let everyone know that a new project has kicked off</em>."</p>



<p>Even though by the sounds of that, we'll be waiting a long time to see any actual gameplay of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, it's exciting to get a look at what the studio is working on, and to know that there's more to come regarding Black Myth: Wukong. Hopefully, we'll have more concrete information soon on when Game Science is ready to release its next project.</p>

            <p>Fire up the geiger counter, the second series of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV series</a> just showed off a trailer during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. It premieres on 17th December.</p>
<p>If it wasn't clear already, this chain of episodes is set to take us to NEW VEGAS. I said NEW VEGAS. That's NEW VEGAS, the setting of obscure 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: NEW VEGAS</a>. Understand? I don't think you do, so let's all look over here while I point to this sign. It says Lucky 38, which is a casino in NEW VEGAS.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, I doth protest this much because I'm a NEW VEGAS fan who's looking forward to taking in this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-tv-creators-saved-iconic-elements-for-season-2-so-it-doesnt-feel-like-they-just-skimmed-wikipedia">second series of Fallout</a> when it premieres in December. Ahead of that, this outing of it showed us The Ghoul and Lucy heading to New Vegas in pursuit of a certain someone (I won't say who, to avoid series one spoilers). Between the trailer and little chat actors Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten and the showrunners had with the Geoffman, we look to be getting a lot more of that Purnell/Goggins duo rubbing off on each other in series two, which sounds great to me.</p><p>They'll have to do a lot to pry my attention away from everyone's favourite preservation tube-dwelling Fallout billionaire, though. After popping in briefly in series one, NEW VEGAS' own Robert Edwin House looks to be playing a big role in series two. He and Walton Goggins' Cooper Howard are having plenty of pre-war chats, which see the suave, moustachioed House stare deeply into the Goggler's eyes while talking down to him just like he does to a certain videogame mailperson. Phwoar, Bob Residence. If you weren't a shrivelled prune by the time my character reached you, they'd have stabbed you through some bedsheets after a round or two, rather than that Benny.</p>
<p>Despite all the NEW VEGAS, I'm keen to see whether, with all of of its major characters all now set up and past the early stages of a playthrough when you're still convinced you're not gonna resort to speccing into speech, the series does anything major to take Fallout places it's not been. The likes of new factions or visits to locations the games haven't touched, just to spice up the big screening of things we know and love. Though, I'm aware that's something that I may well be in the minority on, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">massive popularity</a> of the first series.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Either way, odds are Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, and co will once again be the faces of a good post-apocalyptic adventure, and one that looks like it's leaning heavily into pre-war flashbacks of NEW VEGAS in all its glory.</p>
<p>That's NEW VEGAS, lest you forget amid your Silver Rush to get on Tops of all the other Gamescom Opening Night live news.</p>

<p>Game Science has dropped a tease at an expansion to the story of Black Myth: Wukong, confirming the Journey to the West is not over.</p>



<p>The title, which was released last year and is finally joining Xbox on August 20, was a breakout success for the studio, with many expecting DLC would be announced at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Instead, the finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer for Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, a brand-new title from Game Science that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong</a>—but more could be on the horizon.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-journey-will-continue">Black Myth: Wukong Journey Will Continue</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to wait. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a> for Black Myth: Zhong Kui, a series of questions and answers were shared about the development of the new title, with one stand-out entry concerning the decision to develop a brand-new game and not create a sequel for Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>Explaining the decision, Game Science stated the aspiration to “take a tentative first step” to “build more game experiences,” “challenge ourselves with bolder features,” and “bring fresh ideas to our world and narrative design.”</p>



<p>The key detail concerning Wukong, however, came right at the end with a message that said: “And to all friends who love Black Myth: Wukong, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>It’s not clear whether the story from Wukong will continue in a new title as a direct sequel, or whether DLC is planned for the original title.</p>



<p>If the plan is for a direct sequel, that would likely come after the release of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, which itself is a long way off, considering development is in very early stages and “even Yocar himself has absolutely no idea” when a release will be.</p>



<p>Do you want to see DLC released for Black Myth: Wukong, or are you happy to wait for a direct sequel? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3347/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

But perhaps not for long, as he absorbs Phoenix's flames in the first video of the map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P44x3oxvhFY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P44x3oxvhFY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Throne of Knull will also be one of the settings for the game's new mode, Resource Rumble. Starting on August 21, Resource Rumble will pit teams against one other as they attempt to gather enough resource points to claim victory. However, teams can steal victory from the jaws of defeat by robbing their rivals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGfp8UJDpdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGfp8UJDpdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>NetEase also teased an event called Ancient Powers Awaken that launches on August 21 and will offer new epic rewards and a free Old Man Strange costume for Doctor Strange. There will also be new improvements to matchmaking and ranking systems soon. Those adjustments will be announced on August 21 on Marvel Rivals' social media channels.</p><p>Earlier this month, NetEase announced plans to target toxic players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-record-all-voice-chat-to-target-toxic-players/1100-6533630/" data-ref-id="1100-6533630">by recording all voice chat in Marvel Rivals</a>. NetEase has also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-new-character-arrivals-wont-rely-on-mcu-release-schedules/1100-6533078/" data-ref-id="1100-6533078">it's not reliant on MCU schedules</a> to introduce new heroes, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-could-have-original-characters-in-the-future/1100-6534040/" data-ref-id="1100-6534040">may even introduce original characters</a> in the future.</p>

		<p>Survival horror fans have been treated to a new look at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> during <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gamescom">Gamescom</a> 2025. The survival horror sequel, which made its debut during E3 earlier this year, will take fans of the franchise back to Raccoon City with a new lead protagonist at the helm.</p>
<p>A release for the upcoming title has been confirmed for February 27th, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Check out Capcom’s latest gameplay video.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Gamescom Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/19LGIQNmN4M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>
<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, the Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>

<p>While it hasn’t been confirmed, we’re also likely to see a demo. Both RE7 and Village gave fans a tantalising slither of gameplay to keep them sated, so let’s hope Requiem follows this trend.</p>

<p>During Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a> now has a free demo available for users on all relevant platforms, including the Switch 2.</p>
<p>It should be available for download by the time you're reading this, but if not, then just keep an eye out over the coming hours for an update to the Switch 2 eShop; it'll be there before you know it.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect, the demo will include the first nine chapters of the story, and will also allow you to freely explore the open world. Online co-op is also supported for up to three players via cross-play, and all save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Titanic Evolution</strong> - <strong><em>Daemon X Machina</em></strong>’s high-octane armored action debuts on a new generation of platforms, bringing with it an epic sci-fi adventure, gameplay that’s accessible to newcomers, and an expanded scope sure to satisfy returning fans.</p>
<p><strong>Build a Better You</strong> - Now a nimble suit of armor, each Arsenal can be fully customized both in design and in loadout, with the ability to craft or salvage new elements.</p>
<p><strong>Together You Can Make a Difference</strong> - Cooperative and asynchronous multiplayer means players never truly fight alone. Team up with friends online to tackle the epic story and battles together.</p>
<p><strong>Beautiful and Deadly</strong> - Explore an alien planet in an Arsenal as players battle against mechanical and organic enemies. Trek through the vast open world on foot, fly through the skies, or when all else fails, gallop on horseback across plains, swamps, mountains, and more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We recently went hands-on with Titanic Scion and came away feeling pretty optimistic about the whole thing. Needless to say, while we'll reserve our full judgement until the game launches, we reckon you should keep an eye on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ghost of Yotei Legends Co-Op Multiplayer Confirmed for 2026, New Gameplay Showcased at Gamescom ONL 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-legends-2026-release-gamescom-onl-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yotei-legends-co-op-multiplayer-confirmed-for-2026-new-gameplay-showcased-at-gamescom-onl-2025.1274946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ghost of Yotei is arriving on PS5 and PS5 Pro later this year on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">October 2, 2025</a>, and ahead of that launch at Gamescom ONL 2025, developer Sucker Punch Productions confirmed that the popular multiplayer Legends mode introduced in Ghost of Tsushima is also making its way over to Ghost of Yotei, with Ghost of Yotei Legends confirmed with a 2026 release window.</p>



<p>Just how Legends was free for Ghost of Tsushima players, it will also be free DLC for all owners of Ghost of Yotei when it eventually launches sometime next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends will offer two-player story missions and four-player survival matches. This time around, you’ll play as one of four character classes and try to defeat demonic, giant versions of members of the Yōtei Six, plus a variety of new enemies that fight alongside them,"</em> writes Andrew Goldfarb, senior communications manager at Sucker Punch in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post.</a></p>



<p>The blog post also featured concept art of the enemies you'll face, which you can see here.</p>

				    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>It's exciting to know that we'll be able to dig back into Legends following the main release for Yotei, which is coming in October. It's unfortunate that we have to wait until 2026 to check it out, and that even those in attendance at Gamescom ONL 2025 and the rest of the convention won't get a chance to play it this week.</p>



<p>Still, Legends was a surprise mode that fans of Ghost of Tsushima loved, and knowing that it'll be coming to Yotei further solidifies the next entry in Sucker Punch's 'Ghost' series as a true successor to Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

<p>The Keighleybot intrduced Zero Parades trailer as a "first look" at a spy RPG ZA/UM have been working on. Oh, you mean the spy game they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despite-it-all-disco-elysiums-original-studio-have-revealed-espionage-filled-new-game-c4">revealed earlier this year</a>, Project C4, I mouthed at the screen. Geoff didn't answer, or even mention the name Project C4. So, unless this is an example of spyish doubling up to confuse a foe, I assume the two must be one in the same.</p><p>Anyway, in Zero Parades, the name for which comes with a host of optional taglines including "Zero Parades for fake radicals", which given all that's happened with folks seen as radical ideasmiths leaving ZA/UM in the Disco aftermath feels maybe a bit cheeky. Anyway, in this game you play as an operant Hershel Wilk, alias CASCADE, who's described as being "brilliant, burnt-out, possibly cursed", as well as "an Anti-Icon". Hershel's also a woman, so modify the mental image of Harry Du Bois that description's inevitably given you a little bit. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">Steam page</a> continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote>Five years ago you led your team into the abyss and have been haunted by your failures ever since. Now you've been recalled for a mysterious assignment that may give you a chance to prove yourself again. Find yourself thrown into a three-way struggle for cultural and ideological power, played out across an unforgettable new city. In Zero Parades, the world itself is a character with its own secrets, traumas, and miracles for you to discover.</blockquote>
<p>Much like in Project C4's reveal, a big thing's made of the fact you'll be failing a lot, and tha your failure will take you places via improvisation. Places that might not be as ideal, but that be how the dice are sometimes.</p>
<p>Zero Parades, or the artist that looks to be formerly known as Project C4, is currently without a release date. You can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863680/ZERO_PARADES/">here</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-protagonist-atsu-wolf-ps5-1851657667"><em>Ghost of Yōtei Legends</em></a> will bring multiplayer to Sony’s fall blockbuster, though not until next year. The cooperative online mode will arrive as free DLC sometime in 2026.</p> <p>For anyone unfamiliar with the mode from the original game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-going-to-play-the-shit-out-of-ghost-of-tsushima-s-ne-1845397850"><em>Legends</em> was a multiplayer spin-off for <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> that had players team up online to take down mythical challenges in a new series of story missions, fight off waves of enemies in a horde-like survival mode, or compete with other players to see who could rack up the highest score. There were character classes, difficulty ranks, and unlockable cosmetics. It was one of those multiplayer add-ons to a single-player adventure that was way better than it had any right to be.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost of Yōtei - &quot;Song of Vengeance&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FM08YoziYJs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/ghost-of-yotei-legends-dlc-is-coming-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog post</a> suggests things will work pretty much the same in <em>Ghost of Yotei Legends, </em>though this time the story missions will revolve around teaming up to take down members of the Yōtei Six, the main antagonists of the single-player campaign. They’ll be accompanied by new enemies, however, and presumably have other, more challenging tricks up their sleeves. The return of the survival mode is also confirmed, though it’s currently unclear if that will include the 2v2 contest option as well. It sounds like Sucker Punch will reveal more details once <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is out on October 2.</p> <p>The original <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> multiplayer mode was one of Sony’s more successful first-party forays into live-service content. Its popularity among fans made it seem like a slam dunk impressive enough to justify a full-blown standalone spin-off game. But despite the literal billions Sony has poured into trying to get a fleet of live-service games off the ground,<em> Legends</em> hasn’t been among the projects released or canceled, at least that we know of. If anything, the success of <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> proves there’s definitely players out there who want innovative co-op riffs on traditional single-player games. We’ll see if<em> Ghost of Yotei Legends</em> can satisfy some of that pent-up demand when it arrives next year.</p>

<p>This year’s Gamescom has officially kicked off. That means that today, we were treated to a trailer-laden showcase known as Opening Night Live, straight from Cologne, Germany and featuring none other than Geoff Keighley.</p> <p>ONL was pretty packed this year, with some solid trailers and reveals of many awesome-looking games. As always, we’ve rounded up everything that caught our eye. It was a dense show, so read on!</p> <hr> <h2><span id="hollow-knight-silksong"></span><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Host Geoff Keighley Kicks Off gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94P9Upb_qjQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While we didn’t get a firm release <em>date</em> of the ever-elusive sequel to <em>Hollow</em> <em>Knight</em>, Geoff Keighley took to the Gamescom stage to officially declare that the game is coming out <em>this year </em>and to show off some new gameplay. A more in-depth presentation from developer Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">is coming on Thursday</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Hollow Knight Silksong </em>launches in 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="call-of-duty-black-ops-7"></span><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/egA6Pj485eA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The world is in a bad place in 2035 according to <em>Black Ops 7</em>, so it’s a good thing you’ve got a gun and a willingness to shoot people. I mean, that’s the premise for all these kindsa things, but at least the level design looks surprisingly batty! I’ll take it. I will <em>not</em> take this version of Metallica’s “Master of Puppets,” though.</p>

 <p>You can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/afjIgtKWwDE">an interview with the devs here</a>, and a deeper dive into <a href="https://youtu.be/mojN1Xy5mZA">what Treyarch is cooking up for the campaign here</a>.</p> <p><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;launches on November 14, 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="lords-of-the-fallen-2"></span><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Lords of the Fallen 2 World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1-WuCwkO9E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Gods are all cool until they do that “forsaking us” thing. Then ya gotta seek some retribution. That’s the premise for <em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em>, which got a gory and fancy-lookin’ trailer today. A look at some gameplay is expected later this year.</p> <p><strong><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em> is expected to launch in 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="sekiro-no-defeat"></span><em>Sekiro: No Defeat</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice World Premiere Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mx384l4Q4Os?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Showing off some intense sword battles, today we got a nice look at the upcoming anime adaptation of FromSoft’s speedy, parry-based action adventure game&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>.</p>

This game looks way more <em>Arkham</em> than the previous <em>Lego Batman </em>releases, which is a mighty good sign.

 <p><strong><em>Warhammer 40, 000</em> <em>Dawn of War IV</em> is expected to arrive in 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><span id="monster-hunter-wilds-x-final-fantasy-xiv"></span><em>Monster Hunter Wilds x Final Fantasy XIV</em><span></span></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy XIV Crossover Event Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 202" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZS3BUKtk8E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>How have we not had chocobos in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em> yet?

              <p>Today, at the very end of Gamescom Opening Night Live, Geoff had one more secret to reveal: The developers behind the <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-review-soulslike-pc-ps5-1851629456">super-popular action RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> are working on a new game, <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui,</em> starring a new mythical hero.</p> <p>Here’s the very short teaser for<em> Zhong Kui</em>, which doesn’t have a release date yet:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Science's New Title | Black Myth: Zhong Kui - Teaser Trailer (Chinese Dub)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqe3j4Qch1Y?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em> isn’t a direct sequel to <em>Wukong</em>. <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui">On the new game’s official website, the devs explained</a> that they wanted to “build more distinct game experiences, to challenge ourselves with bolder features” and work on “fresh ideas.” However, they did tease an actual sequel or DLC to <em>Wukong</em>, saying: “And to all friends who love <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that, despite a slick-looking CG trailer showing off the new mythical hero and setting, Game Science admits it doesn’t have much to show because the game is still very early in development, saying that <em>Zhong Kui</em> is “little more than an empty folder at this stage.” However, the devs said they love announcing new things and updating fans on August 20, so they created a CG short to “let everyone know that a new project has kicked off.” But yeah, don’t expect to be playing this game anytime soon.</p> <p>According to Game Science,<em> Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-souls-like-looks-cool-even-if-it-might-never-come-o-1844786724"><em>Wukong</em></a>, is a single-player action RPG that will follow “the same business model as before.” That seems to imply that this sequel won’t be free-to-play when it eventually launches.</p> <p>“However, you won’t be playing a monkey role this time,” explained the studio. “That said, we’re still exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between <em>Wukong</em> and <em>Zhong Kui.</em> So take it easy—let us impress ourselves first before we serve it to you.”</p> <p>On August 20, 2024, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> launched on PlayStation 5 and PC and quickly became a massive hit. The game saw over 2.4 million concurrent players on Steam alone, beating out popular games like <em>Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, Cyberpunk,</em> and many more. It still, to this day, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-steam-game-pass-cyberpunk-elden-ring-1851626674">holds the record for second-highest number of players all online at the same time on Steam</a>, only beaten by <em>PUBG’s</em> massive 3.2 concurrent players record. Needless to say, a lot of people are excited for more<em> Black Myth</em>, and I expect that when <em>Zhong Kui</em> eventually arrives on PC and consoles, it will be as big if not bigger.</p>

<p>Game Science dropped a huge surprise during Gamescom Opening Night Live with the reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui, and the title immediately raises questions on whether it is a direct sequel to Black Myth: Wukong.</p>



<p>The finale of Gamescom Opening Night Live was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>, with the footage showing the character from Chinese mythology riding on the back of a giant tiger, earning awe from the audience.</p>



<p>As both titles share the Black Myth name, some confusion around Zhong Kui’s sequel status has emerged, but we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-black-myth-wukong-sequel">Is Black Myth: Zhong Kui a Black Myth: Wukong Sequel?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Menacing. Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Black Myth: Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>On the <a href="https://www.gamesci.cn/zhongkui" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, several questions on the development of Black Myth: Zhong Kui were answered, including why a decision was made to release a new title and not provide a sequel to Black Myth: Wukong first.</p>



<p>The question itself makes it clear that Zhong Kui is not a sequel to Wukong, instead telling a story elsewhere within Chinese mythology, though there could be references and Easter Eggs connecting the game to Wukong.</p>



<p>There are many similarities between the games, however, with Black Myth: Zhong Kui sharing “the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore,” while the game will remain a standard single-player ARPG, “following the same business model as before.”</p>



<p>Given the very early stage in development, however, full details on Black Myth: Zhong Kui are not yet known, and it could be a while before more concrete reveals are shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-receive-a-sequel">Will Black Myth: Wukong Receive a Sequel?</h2>



<p><strong>Game Science has not confirmed whether Black Myth: Wukong will receive a sequel or additional DLC, though it appears the door is open.</strong></p>



<p>At the end of the question on the website concerning why Black Myth: Zhong Kui was chosen for development, players were assured that “the westward journey won’t end here.”</p>



<p>No further details have been provided, however, but stay tuned for more news from Game Science in the future, particularly given the long-awaited Xbox release.</p>

<p>Returning from Ghost of Tsushima, the free co-op Legends mode will launch in 2026 for Ghost of Yotei. </p>



<p>The original Ghost of Tsushima added Legends, which brought fans to an otherworldly battleground. You and four resurrected warriors would take on the demonic forces to survive. While not included in the base game at launch, Legends was a huge success and brought many back to the game. Now, Ghost of Yotei plans to bring it back in 2026.</p>



<p><strong>This story is breaking news, so updates, including more information, will be done after publication.</strong></p>

<p>While we don’t see any gameplay of it, the stinger at the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM08YoziYJs">latest Ghost of Yotei trailer</a> revealed that Legends is returning. It will bring back the four-player co-op experience from Ghost of Tsushima, now for new audiences. As mentioned by Geoff Keighley at Gamescom Opening Night Live, the experience will be free, so all can play it. It is currently set to launch sometime in 2026, but it’s likely we’ll hear more closer to Ghost of Yotei’s October 3rd launch.</p>
