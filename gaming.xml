<p>The latest game in the <i>AI: Somnium Files</i> series arrived last month, and it’s shorter than the previous ones. <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is actually a spin-off that takes place between the first two games, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i> and <i>AI: The Somnium Files -Nirvana Initiative-</i>, as well as sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date.</p> <p>This time around, Kaname Date must save our favorite idol Iris after she gets abducted by a UFO and is forced to play various escape games to survive. Directed by Kazuya Yamada supervised by original series creator Uchikoshi, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> implements escape room puzzles similar to that of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, which Uchikoshi also created. These escape room scenarios help pad out N<em>o Sleep for Kaname Date</em> despite its much shorter length.</p>  <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname</i> has five chapters for you to play through, along with multiple “dead-end” endings.</p>

 <p>In the game, you’ll have to go through “Somniums” (different from the escape rooms) which are pseudo puzzles that you’ll need to solve in order to progress the story. During these Somnium investigations, you’ll be on a timer, so you won’t have time to examine every item. But examining every item unlocks “eyeballs,” which are in-game currency that lets you unlock bonus content for after you’ve beaten the main story (don’t worry, there are no real-world microtransactions). You can also earn more eyeballs by finding collectibles throughout the game.</p> <p>Some of the bonuses you can unlock include concept art and extra endings called “alternate alternate endings.” They cost a certain amount of eyeballs to unlock, and some of the bonuses may not appear until you’ve reached certain alternate endings in the story.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618125"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618125">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>You will have to replay certain chapters, Somniums, and escape room puzzles to find the alternate endings, but thankfully, the game’s flowchart notes which chapters have them. That way, you won’t have to blindly search for them.</p>

 <p>That being said, a full playthrough of No Sleep for Kaname Date should take you about 12-15 hours to complete, depending on how good you are at solving escape puzzles.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-achievements-does-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-have"></span>How many Achievements does <em>No Sleep for Kaname Date</em> have?<span></span></h2> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is available for Switch and Steam. While the former doesn’t have an achievement system, the latter does. Since this game is much shorter than the others, you’re looking at about an extra five hours to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <h2><span id="is-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-on-playstation-or-xbox"></span>Is No Sleep for Kaname Date on PlayStation or Xbox?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is only on Switch and Steam. While the previous two games are on all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> has not been announced for PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618126"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618126">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, that doesn’t mean that developer Spike Chunsoft won’t bring them over later. 2023’s Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was a Switch exclusive until it came to all other platforms a little over a year later. Given <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>, it’s definitely possible that <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> will arrive on other platforms in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date – From AI: The Somnium Files</i> launches on July 25 for Switch/Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Soccer (or football) is the most popular sport in the world, so it makes sense that an exciting online multiplayer game that nails the fundamentals of the pastime would be well-received. And developer Sloclap has succeeded at this by kicking the ball directly into the goal with <i>Rematch</i>. Following in the footsteps of beloved titles like <i>Rocket League</i> with its vibrant, arcade-style gameplay that pits teams together in frenetic showdowns, <i>Rematch</i> is basically everything someone could ask for in a soccer game.</p> <p>So, if you’re diving into <i>Rematch</i>‘s fast-paced matches and wondering whether you’ll be able to team up with friends on other platforms, you’re probably curious about the game’s crossplay functionality. Here’s what you need to know about crossplay in <i>Rematch</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <b><i>Rematch</i></b><b> does not feature crossplay </b><b><i>yet</i></b>. However, that shouldn’t get you down too badly, as Sloclap has some good news for soccer fans awaiting this feature. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/625556610639462619">It’s been confirmed</a> that cross-play will arrive around the end of August with Patch 3:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!). Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but that’s still to be confirmed. More news very soon!”</p></blockquote> <p>At <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/rematch-launch-priorities-next-steps">launch the studio stated</a>, “It’s very important for us that our players are able to enjoy <i>Rematch</i> with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority, we’re committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we’ll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible.”</p> <p>So, we should expect to hear more about this feature in the coming days as Sloclap continues to work diligently on the popular game. In the meantime, you’ll have to stick to playing <i>Rematch</i> with pals within your gaming ecosystem. It’s a bummer, but at least you know it’s temporary!</p> <hr> <p><i>Rematch</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <p>In news unlikely to surprise you, modders have already rolled back the "downgraded game experience" introduced with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' latest patch, 1.5, for PC players.</p>
<p>While the Steam rating was already 'mixed', players have wasted no time sharing their dismay,  complaining in Steam reviews that the developers "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119960294/recommended/2277560/">sacrificed the original game's vision to appeal to a loud, nationalist minority</a>" and made "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210163620/recommended/2277560/">plot change[s that make] the story completely different, and even make some of the characters motivation pointless</a>".</p>

<p>These changes include revising boss fights so that you no longer kill them, but merely "exhaust" them, which some <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/">say</a> "breaks the whole plot of the game".</p>
<p>For its part, developer Leenzee didn't note any significant changes were coming with the latest patch, only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">detailed</a> some balancing and bug fixes, saying the patch "added some 'Wuchang' voice to complete the story, and added some NPC dialogues".</p>
<p>Now, as noted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-remove-censorship-patch-1-5-on-steam-mod/">TheGamer</a>, a mod for Wuchang: Fallen Feathers entitled "Rollback censorship patch - STEAM" seeks to undo those very changes.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," the mod developer wrote. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialogue from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p>
<p>Uploaded on Friday, 15th August, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">mod</a> is already fast approaching 1000 downloads, with one user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=posts">writing</a>: "Thank you. Hate seeing artistic integrity being sacrificed on the altar of politics again".</p>
<p>Ed thought Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' new PC patch offered "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuchang-fallen-feathers-has-managed-to-sidestep-soulslike-fatigue-and-it-keeps-getting-better">improved performance and much-needed balance adjustments to tweak some of its infuriatingly cheap difficulty"</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ Q&amp;A</strong></p><p><strong>Is Swords of Legends a canonical sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> franchise, or more of a spin-off?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is the official sequel to the <em>Gujian</em> single-player series developed by Shanghai Aurogon Studio. Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, it will further expand the series’ universe and lore.</p><p><strong>Is it a premium single-player title or a <a title="Genres > Free-to-Play [425 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/free-to-play">free-to-play</a> live-service project? Which platforms will it launch on? Will there be a mobile version?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is a premium single-player title planned for release on PC and consoles, with no mobile version. It is not a free-to-play title.</p><p><strong>What’s the game genre? Is it Soulslike? Is it open world?</strong></p><p><em>Swords of Legends</em> is an action RPG with a strong, well-paced main story and rich cinematic storytelling, complemented by side quests and deep exploration. Neither a Soulslike nor a fully <a title="Genres > Open-World [696 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a>, the gameplay structure is closer to a “wide linear” experience, allowing players to approach the <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,470 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> at their own pace within the guided progression.</p><p><strong>We noticed a clear shift in art direction and atmosphere compared to earlier entries. What kind of story are you telling this time?</strong></p><p>As always, the game is set in an original fantasy world inspired by Chinese mythology and mystical folklore. This time, we’re expanding the <em>Gujian</em> universe by placing players in the role of an “Underworld Enforcer”—a unique figure who traverses between the realms of the living and the dead. You may have spotted familiar figures like the Ox-Head and Horse-Face guardians in the trailer; they will act as companions on your journey.</p><p>However, this is not a mere retelling of classic myths—players will personally guide lost souls, helping them resolve lingering regrets. Each soul has a deeply personal backstory. For example, in the trailer, you saw a woman dancing before a set of bronze bells, unable to let go of her attachment to the mortal world, willing to pay any price to remain.</p><p><strong>How challenging is the combat?</strong></p><p>We are not aiming for punishing difficulty or purely skill-gated combat. For example, “soul capturing” is both a narrative mechanic to the story and a core combat build. Players can capture the souls of certain monsters and summon them to assist in battle, with some offering <a title="Genres > Co-Op [315 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> combo attacks—such as the special drop attack triggered in the trailer when fighting alongside the Ox-Head and Horse-Face. Exploration will also yield a variety of utility items to aid in combat, and flexible weapon-skill loadouts will allow players to adapt to different enemy types. Our goal is to ensure players of all skill levels can have fun—and, as in any good <a title="Genres > RPG [17,506 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>, enjoy the satisfying journey of growing stronger.</p><p><strong>I’ve never played any game of <em>Gujian</em> franchise before. Will I need to catch up on the previous titles to enjoy this one?</strong></p><p>No. Each entry in the <em>Gujian</em> franchise tells a standalone, complete story, and this installment is no exception—it introduces new characters and a self-contained narrative.</p><p><strong>What’s the current development status? Will the game be ready soon?</strong></p><p>Back in 2021, we were still in the early stages of initiating the project and conducting preliminary research. We set very high-quality expectations for the new title, and after exploring various technical approaches, we decided to develop it using Unreal Engine 5. This choice came with a significant budget requirement, which was a major challenge at the time.</p><p>While learning the engine, we also carried out early-stage research and planning. In early 2024, we secured investment, allowing the Swords of Legends team to gradually expand. As a result, the game has been in full development for about two years.</p><p>We have now entered the mass production stage, and with the release of the first trailer, we aim to showcase our progress so far and attract more exceptional talent to join our team.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/single-player-chinese-action-rpg-swords-of-legends-formerly-gujian-4-revealed-for-consoles-and-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="SIWIQU S3 MAX TV Dock Station For Nintendo Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0706b57b5d6ff/siwiqu-s3-max-tv-dock-station-for-nintendo-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's own dock is a non-nonsense device that just works. You slide your console in, crack the Joy-Con off, and boom, you're off to the races. Given the larger size of Switch 2, though, its dock is a substantial slab of black plastic and various third-party firms have stepped in with offerings that are a little more portable.</p>
<p>Antank is one such company, and the S3 MAX TV Dock Station for Nintendo Switch 2 — also known as the SIWIQU Dock Station in some parts — is certainly smaller than the dock that comes with the console. Weighing in at 109 grams (compared to 383 grams), you'll barely notice you're carrying it in your satchel, backpack, or anywhere else you care to secrete your hardware.</p>
<p>Antack sent me the standard model for review, although they have another one that includes an Ethernet port for wired internet connection. Otherwise, on the back of the dock, you get the expected ports: two USB-A slots, a USB-C port for the power, an HDMI port going to your TV, and a button to switch between TV-out and the Switch 2's own display. Beyond the dock itself, in the box you get a little foldout manual with the tiniest text I've ever seen, and that's your lot.</p>

<p>For $35.99 / £28.99, it should come as no surprise that you're not getting Nintendo-level build quality and materials, and the lightness here doesn't help sell the S3 as a premium bit of kit, either. But it's fine; the red and blue end caps match up with the accents around the Joy-Con, and sitting beside your TV, it looks pleasant enough.</p>
<p>You're also not getting an AC power adapter, the requisite cable, or an HDMI cable, and Antack recommends using Nintendo's official gear. If you've got a Switch 2, you'll obviously have that already, but if you're buying this as a cheap dock for a second room, you'll need to factor into your budget another $34.99 / £24.99 for the power adapter, plus an HDMI 2.1 cable (the ultra high speed variety).</p>
<p>Setup is as simple as you'd expect. Connect the cables, turn your TV on, and boom. It works. In fact, I had to reconnect the console a couple of times — apparently a quirk that's been ironed out with <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update">a firmware update</a> I've subsequently run according to the <a href="https://antank.net/pages/s3-max-firmware-update-guide-for-windows">instructions on Antack's website</a> — but then it just functioned as advertised.</p>

<p>A little blue LED on the front indicates that everything's powered up. The S3 supports 4K (8K, in fact, according to the blurb, although you won't get that out of your Switch and I've got no way to display 8K content) and up to 120Hz output - although the Switch 2 can only manage 120fps at 1080p, and you'll need a 120Hz+-capable TV, naturally. Several hours of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> delivered image quality on a 55-inch LG OLED that looked indistinguishable from the official dock to my eyes. HDR fired up just as with the standard offering, and everything just worked.</p>
<p>Back to the unit itself, Antank's website blurb mentions a "spring-buffered docking port", although I can't see any evidence of a spring on my unit. The connection at the bottom is totally rigid and fits the console port snugly once you seat the thing correctly, which can take a couple of tries.</p>
<p>Having the system 'unsheathed', you'll definitely note the heat it's pumping out in a way you may not when it's resting in Nintendo's dock. The S3 effectively blocks the console's air intakes along the bottom edge, which gave me pause, but temperature-wise, the fact that the system isn't wrapped in black plastic helps disperse heat from the casing and "provides better cooling than the original charging dock", according to Antank. I don't have the equipment to measure that, unfortunately, and I'd question if the cooling is 'better' than Nintendo's dock, but it seemed roughly the same to me from a volume and temperature perspective.</p>
<p>Switching to handheld mode by hitting the round button on the rear, I noticed the console's fan whirring up more in the summer heat. Given the fact that you can charge via the top USB-C port anyway, I'd prefer to have those intakes uncovered in tabletop mode, personally. Yes, a cable sticking out the top isn't aesthetically pleasing, but I'd rather not tax my still-relatively-new system more than necessary when it's not outputting to the TV. Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, but honestly, I don't see much point in the tabletop button when that's built into the console as-is.</p>

<p>The size reduction is a boon, certainly, but the S3 does come with some minor irritations. Firstly, you'll need to hold the dock down before pulling to remove the console - there's no slide-in/slide-out here. The tight fit means that the S3 doesn't work with third-party cases, either, so you'll need to remove them beforehand. Also, the dock doesn’t seem to communicate with the TV to wake it from standby, if that’s something you’re used to with the standard dock.</p>
<p>While three rubber 'feet' prevent it from slipping, the dock relies on the power and HDMI cables being connected to provide stability and prevent everything toppling backwards at the slightest touch. Obviously, the Switch 2 has its own kickstand, so using the S3 as a makeshift stand doesn't make sense anyway - just be cautious when you're setting things up and don't put your system in the dock until the cables are connected.</p>
<p>And that's it. It's definitely more of a travel accessory in my eyes; if I were in the market for a second dock for the home, I'd probably pay the extra for the slide-in/out convenience (and the necessary cables) of the official option. If you're the kind of person eager to travel as light as possible, or who feels a missed opportunity when playing your Switch 2 in the shadow of a big hotel-room TV, the S3 might be for you, though.</p>
<p>And even factoring in the necessary extras, you're still a fair way off the $124.99 / £92.99 that Nintendo wants for a second dock with those essentials included. For the budget-conscious gamer, then, or travellers who fancy being able to hook up on the fly, it's a good option.</p>

              <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> was one of the earliest battle royale titles to release and is widely considered to be the one that brought the sub-genre into the mainstream. But despite being around for so many years, it’s still managing to keep its update train rollin’ to entice new and returning players to continue sneaking, looting, and blasting their way to chicken dinners.</p> <p>Whether you’re coming back from a long time away, or you’re just checking the game out for the first time, you may be wondering about whether it offers cross-platform features. Here’s what to know about crossplay and cross-progression in <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ crossplay situation isn’t cut and dry. While it does offer crossplay, it takes a much more limited approach to the feature than many similar multiplayer titles. Let me break it down in an easy-to-understand format below.</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is supported between PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between consoles and PC.</li> <li aria-level="1">Crossplay is not supported between any platforms and <i>PUBG: Mobile</i>, as it is its own separate game.</li> </ul> <p>So, as you can see, the only platforms that work together are PlayStation and Xbox. So, if you’re a console player who has friends on PC, well, no you don’t.</p> <h2>Does <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>Things are more straightforward when it comes to <i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i>‘ cross-progession status. But that’s mostly because <b><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i></b><b> does not offer cross-progression at all</b>. This means that if you pick up a copy of the game on one platform and make a lot of progress, you’ll still need to start over with a whole new account when moving to another platform.</p> <p>It’s definitely a bummer not to see cross-progression supported in one of the most beloved battle royale titles in the world. But given that it was released before cross-platform features became the norm, it’s a bit more forgivable, I suppose.</p> <hr> <p><i>PUBG: Battlegrounds</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/what-the-heck-is-going-on-with-pubgs-crossplay-situation-2000618106]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/discounty-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discounty-review-%E2%80%93-not-another-life-sim-clone.1272177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When a genre reaches a certain point of popularity, it’s hard to escape its gravitational pull. Life Sims are all the rage these days, with everything from spooky graveyard-based affairs to the more run-of-the-mill wholesome farming life experiences that we’ve all seen 1000 of over the past few years. You may be shocked to hear, then, that our <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/discounty" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Discounty </em></a>review shows that this particular life sim has managed to avoid the pitfalls of being just another clone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is <em>Discounty</em>?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-having-a-conversation-in-the-back-room-of-a-shop.jpg?itok=QqWb5H-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-two-people-having-a-conversation-in-the-back-room-of-a-shop.jpg?itok=LjeNJNtk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are a few "broken" dialogue moments, but they're so damn rare that it's barely worth mentioning. Besides, give it a week and it'll be patched out anyway.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Discounty </em>is the debut title from Crinkle Cut Games, a small Danish studio formed back in 2021 with a small cultural grant. The game focuses on your character being invited to a small town to help your aunt run her shop. As you get to know the town and further your aunt's commercial empire, you learn more about the people you’re living with, and have to balance your desire for the business to be a success, as well as your desire not to completely destroy your new small-town home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re thinking that things sound pretty familiar so far, then I don’t blame you. Everything from the journey to visit a distant relative who needs help with their business to the opening bus ride had me in mind of “yet another life sim game” with the same 8 or 9 tropes trotted out to give fans of the genre something new to do, or rather, a new environment to do it in.</p>

<p>However, it would be a mistake to discount (ha) <em>Discounty </em>as just another life sim game. Sure, there are a few tropes that persist, but the crux of the gameplay is pretty far removed from what is going on in most life sims.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>It’s Our Differences That Make Us The Same</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-person-standing-behind-the-counter-of-a-store-with-terrible-carpets-and-walls.jpg?itok=dgGaCmSl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-person-standing-behind-the-counter-of-a-store-with-terrible-carpets-and-walls.jpg?itok=gOgu5pYR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can see, I am great at running a little shop. That's why my drinks, produce, household goods and processed food are all jumbled together like that.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>It’s pretty true that other life sims have struggled to move past the whole “farming” thing. Even games that are supposedly about other aspects of life have a horrible tendency to throw in a small amount of farming “just in case.” This is part of the reason why so many life sim games have a tendency to feel the same, since all of them tend to throw in the same cycle of farming/mining/socialising, and at this point, it’s all been done before so many times that even the thought of trying to count them is actually putting me to sleep.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Discounty</em> handily avoids this issue by actually being about running a shop. There are no social mechanics (at least, you can’t throw chocolate at someone until they marry you), no farming, and no mining/monster hunting. Your focus is on running and improving your shop, and that’s all you really do. You go out to complete missions to make people like you more, but that’s to get more stock from other businesses; other than that, you spend your time collecting supplies, buying new furniture, and rearranging your store so it makes you as much money as possible. That’s it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>You Should Run a Little Shop!</h2>

Thankfully.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>So, the base gameplay of <em>Discounty </em>revolved around the shop itself. Monday – Saturday, you have to arrive at the shop by 9 AM, or fear the wrath of your customers. As people move around the shop buying stuff, you have to restock everything from the back room, keep the floors clean to prevent clients from slowing down, and keep an eye on the till to make sure a huge queue isn’t forming. You also have to make sure that your shoppers are able to find everything and reach the till in a timely manner, something which heavily depends on the layout of your shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the manager of the store, you have to arrange all of your display furniture, consisting primarily of shelves, coolers, and boosters. The shelves and coolers are for displaying regular and frozen products, respectively, while the boosters will make certain item categories more appealing. It’s not good just shoving all of your goods around the place willy-nilly. If you don’t group your items by category, your customers will struggle to find them, and this is likely to have you receiving some negative feedback come closing time. You also need to make sure that the layout of your store doesn’t get too constricting, because these guys loooove to get hung up on shelves or counters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Bugs, Bugs, Gallons of the Stuff</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-very-busy-shop-filled-with-customers-and-a-shopkeeper.jpg?itok=MRkuDRoX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-a-very-busy-shop-filled-with-customers-and-a-shopkeeper.jpg?itok=nnvWJi-q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My supermarket empire thrives!!! Mwa-ha-ha!!!</figcaption></figure><p>As you could probably expect from any indie title, <em>Discounty </em>does have a few buggy moments. At least once, I had the text glitch out on my game, as well as experiencing story events slightly out of order in a way that left me a little confused. Both of these pale in comparison to the AI's tendency to get stuck in places, and then have a paddy at me for them being late with their shopping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you’re working with pathfinding AI, it can be tough to get it perfect, and it’s certainly an example of something that needs tweaking in future versions of the game. You can avoid the problem by using specific layouts, to a degree, but after your final shop expansion, you get some non-optional furniture that seems to act like a people magnet. Most of the time, I could unstick people by spamming the (A) button on them, but once or twice, I just had to wait for the shop to close.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Good, The Great, and the Beautiful</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-the-inside-of-a-small-home-with-rainbow-wallpaper-and-a-few-items-of-decoration.jpg?itok=fVmsnQ2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/discounty-screenshot-showing-the-inside-of-a-small-home-with-rainbow-wallpaper-and-a-few-items-of-decoration.jpg?itok=2hvfxjw2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My house might be small, but I swear that the music that plays here had me thinking of Super Mario Land 2 at the start of each in-game day.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>My gripes aside, <em>Discounty </em>is still coming out of this thing with a huge recommendation. The artwork is beautiful, managing to give the game its own sense of personality rather than looking like 1000 other games on the market, and the sound design is also excellent. It got to a point when I was pretty addicted to hearing my till make the scanning ‘beep’, and was genuinely excited for my Sunday off, which would give me a chance to rearrange my store layout, and both the visuals and sounds have a huge part to play in that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other key factor that makes this a success is the characters. Every person in the game, including the player character, is a distinct personality already, and your input on these people is limited. You don’t have choices to make really, beyond mostly choosing minor dialogue changes, and instead are invited to learn who these people are, why they feel the way they feel, and why most of them aren’t immediately what they appear to be upon your arrival.</p>

<p>Personally, I was hooked by these characters, and I didn’t miss any of the genre’s erstwhile mechanical tropes. Then the story came loaded with a level of nuance that I’ve not seen in games for a long time, and just blew me away.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>

I know you love frozen chips but you've been standing by this chiller for 8 hours now, other customers need their fix."</figcaption></figure><p><em>Discounty </em>is a stellar example of an indie life sim that manages to avoid the traps that come from making a game in the heavily codified life <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/simulation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">simulation</a> genre. While it has its issues here and there, the characters and storyline are a strong hook, and the gameplay of running your shop is unique yet just as addictive as any other experience of a similar ilk. With stunning visuals and sound thrown into the mix, this could easily become a firm favourite of genre fans, and I know that I’m not done with it despite having rolled the credits. It's gotta beat <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-shire-review-can-you-relax-too-much" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tales from the Shire</em></a> at any rate.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The First Descendant developer/publisher Nexon has been accused of using a series of "embarrassing" AI-generated TikTok advertisements, at least one of which is alleged to have imitated a real content creator.</p>

<p>As the OP points out, the issue isn't the use of generative AI in and of itself, but the fact that <a href="https://x.com/DeathMonkeyXL/status/1956828908617109977">at least one ad uses the likeness</a> of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/danielthedemon">DanieltheDemon</a> – and we don't yet know if it was with their consent or not.</p>

<p><i>Overwatch 2</i> remains one of the most popular games in the multiplayer gaming arena due to its lovable roster of characters, strategic gameplay, and consistent updates that keep things feeling fresh for both new and returning players. And if you are brand new to the game or haven’t played in some time, you might be wondering what’s going on in this long-running hero shooter. So let’s get to everything you need to know about <i>Overwatch 2</i> in late summer, 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-going-on-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s going on with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is currently winding down on <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24216161/season-17-hits-with-a-midseason-surge">season 17</a> which saw some reworks to New Junk City and Suravasa, as well as a taste of what’s to come in season 18 with a preview of a new support hero, Wuyang. In fact, you can play as him right now, as his Hero Trial is expected to go until August 18.</p> <p>But Season 18 will arrive in full on August 26, and with it Wuyang will fully join the roster. Also, for the new season, Sojourn will get a new mythic hero skin. You can learn all about that from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBK1JI1Vjeg&amp;t=1814s">the dev livestream here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dev Livestream: Season 18 Mythic Hero Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBK1JI1Vjeg?start=1814&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>We also know that Sojourn will be getting some new perks. The Deceleration Field, which will replace the Extended Mag, will see hit enemies slowed down by a quarter of their top speed. Sojourn’s Adhesive Siphon in favor of her new Friction Generators, which will give her as much as 50 energy while sliding. You can read more about these changes, as well as some updates to Juno in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24226732/weekly-recall-2-perks-2-furious">this official preview of season 18</a>.</p> <h2><span id="who-are-the-best-heroes-right-now"></span>Who are the best heroes right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While season 18 is likely to change things up, right now we’re seeing Orisa and Ramattra leading the pack when it comes to tanks, Tracer and Cassidy laying claim to the best DPS, and Baptiste and Kiriko dominating the support heroes.</p> <p>Of course, given the importance of great teamwork, it’s always hard to sus out which heroes are best at any given moment. So if you’ve been out of the loop for some time, it might be worth jumping back in with a main that feels familiar to you. And if you find they’re not up to snuff anymore, try out one of the ones we just mentioned.</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>If you’re wanting to join up with friends on other platforms, I’ve got some good news for you: <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> features full crossplay support</b>. This means that you can team up with your friends across any platform by adding one another’s Battle.net accounts, which is a quick and easy process.</p> <p>The exception to this crossplay rule is Competitive matches, where console and PC players are separated due to the perceived edge of mouse and keyboard players. While this may disappoint more hardcore players looking to truly test their mettle, most folks should be happy having some casual fun in Quick Play, Arcade, and Custom Matches. That’s not so bad!</p>

 <h2><span id="does-overwatch-2-have-crossprogression"></span>Does <i>Overwatch 2</i> have cross-progression?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news continues, as <b><i>Overwatch 2</i></b><b> also fully supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, you can easily jump between different platforms while maintaining your account’s progress. So, if you’d like to play a few matches on PC before relaxing in bed with your Nintendo Switch 2, no one’s stopping you. All you need to do is ensure you’re signed into the same Battle.net account on each device, and you’re all set!</p> <hr> <p><i>Overwatch 2</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

<h3>"monthly minimum" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Game-key cards and fans that don't earn in Pounds, Euros or Dollars.<br>
Hello Nintendolife friends! Sebastián here from Medellín, Colombia (a big fan from the Global South).<br>
I'd like to talk about why you'd think that Game-key cards are better or worse for your own gaming experience.<br>
For context, videogames are really expensive when exchanged to Colombian Pesos, up to a fifth of our monthly minimum wage.<br>
Fortunately, I earn much more than a minimum wage, but it's still a luxury. So I buy Nintendo games based on 3 options:<br>
1) Physical cartridges that I'd like to collect (or play in the future with our soon to come kid); 2) Physical cartridges that I can play and then re-sell to earn some of the investment back; 3) Digital games on sale for a really low price based on Deku Deals' price history.<br>
Considering Nintendo's tendency to introduce more games as Game-key cards, my interest in physical games is every time smaller, which takes some of the magic away.<br>
What's your take on this? How much is a game compared to your monthly minimum wage in the UK?<br>
¡Saludos desde Colombia!<strong><br>
Sebas.</strong><br>
P.S: Please be sure to share some comment in Spanish, it would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hola Sebastián! According to <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/national-minimum-wage/">Money Saving Expert</a>, assuming a 35-hour work week, the monthly minimum wage in the UK works out to around £1850 right now. Using DK Bananza (£66.99, physical) as a recent example, that would be just over 3.5% of our monthly wage. That's before tax, mind you.</p>
<p>For me, I went digital almost exclusively on Switch 1, and those puny Switch cards could never compete with the majesty of a chunky N64 cart anyway, so for me physical hasn't been very magical for a while. The deep eShop sales and the convenience of having my library instantly accessible made sense to me on a portable system, and I don't regret it.</p>
<p>However, though I get the attraction of being able to resell, Game-Key Cards still feel like the absolute worst of all worlds to me, designed purely to benefit publishers and pass storage costs on to consumers. No me caen bien. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I'd go so far"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good morning/afternoon/evening or whatever time you're reading this. (If you're reading this after midnight, respect to my fellow night owl).</p>
<p>Is it just me (probably not) that thinks that there are some games that are so so good that it's an absolute crime that they're not more well known? My personal example is the whole of the Blaster Master Zero trilogy. The writing is spot on, the gameplay is smooth and gets better throughout all three games, the trilogy leads up to a really satisfying and heartwarming, yet bittersweet conclusion that I'd go so far as to compare to Undertale.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>And it's a genuine shame that even after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDJSziIiD34">NovaZone's video on it on Youtube</a>, I haven't seen much more buzz about it. Best thing is, all three games together you can get for less than £30 even without a sale.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. And play Blaster Master Zero. That is all.<br>

<h3>"the main personalities"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So I noticed a long standing trend of Nintendo life staff adapting other writers' reviews for the video version. I understand that maybe the main personalities on Nintendo life can’t possibly play every major game thoroughly enough to put down their review, but the other issue I see is sometimes the video reviews come across like it’s your personally experience when it really isn’t. Or a reviewer puts in personal info into the review (eg. Mario Kart World) that doesn’t really make sense out of context. So my question - why not have these other reviewers also do the video version? Is it simply they aren’t as much of a personality or video reviews aren’t their thing? Thanks for answering!<br>

<p>For one, we've got a three-person YouTube team who earn their beans from making videos and whose expertise in that department outstrips everyone else on staff by a very wide margin. Capture cards and mics are the least of it - it's a different skillset, and while some of our writers may have the ability, Alex, Felix, and Zion have the know-how, gear, and camera charisma to deliver the best results in the speediest time.</p>
<p>And yes, some of us are just better in writing. Ask my wife. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"entertaining but useless"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Good evening and tsufufum to you, NL,</p>
<p>Inspired by your recent nostalgic trip through the pages of NGC Magazine, I was compelled to do the same, taking about six weeks to chew my way through all 61 issues under the NGC banner. As I went through each issue, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oig6a5UFcypa8GO13yC-PHxOtb_ZO3w7U0tYzBsISGk/edit?usp=sharing">I compiled a spreadsheet of every review</a> featured so I could more easily refer back at a later date, and having now finished I am sharing this document in case it is useful to you as well.</p>
<p>Each review is listed with the issue it appears in and the score awarded, plus some feeble attempt from me to label the game with a genre. Of course, the real reason you read NGC is for their spectacular way with words, and a dry spreadsheet would be meaningless without paying heed to that, so I have also included snippets of many of the reviews in the manner of their (and your!) letters pages.</p>
<p>Also part of the document is a tab of "interesting" features. What counts as interesting obviously varies from one person to another so it's got a definite slant towards things I am interested in myself, but I've tried to highlight features that might also be of interest to the retro public at large... like the reported Pilotwings title being developed by Factor 5, and their repeated insistence that "Nintendo DS" was a temporary name. Oops!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Finally is a list of their fake games, seen as examples in features like their Directory. Often crass, they're mostly jabs at the various staff members who wrote the mag. This tab would probably be reviewed as "entertaining but useless".</p>
<p>I would encourage anyone with even a passing interest in the Gamecube-DS era to take a look into NGC. They were scrappy, chaotic and anarchic, far moreso than their contemporaries, and the magazine has a lot of personality as a result. It's also just fun to look back on old things that were new at the time and see how things have changed (and how they've stayed the same). Their speculation on what Mario's waterpumping backpack did, what Rare would do after Starfox Adventures, the inevitability of Wind Waker 2, and what Nintendo's "third pillar" would come to be, is all entertaining when read with the benefit of living in the future. At the very least, you'll learn some new words to call your friends.</p>
<p>I wonder if any NGC alumni are around and available for interview? I'd love to read some 20-years-later gossip about how things actually ran, if Greener regrets giving Melee 95% (he was right!), and if Shedwards still has his pigs. Not including that Ed guy, of course- he already works for NL.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the words, NL. You are the ship I jumped to when NGC sank, and I'm grateful that you in some manner keep that 100% Unofficial spirit alive.</p>
<p>Beebs<strong><br>
Babybahamut</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eyy, now you're speaking my language! N64 Magazine was my 'era' (and is the reason I'm here doing this today), with that talent and spirit flowing very directly into NGC, just as Super Play fed into N64. Thank you for this - and for the massive compliment.</p>
<p>Alumni-wise, I've had plans for something vaguely in this area for a long while now. It'll be a ways off, but keep the googly eyes peeled.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm off to play some Baldy's Pate. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"before the torches arrive"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ok, this probably won’t go well with NL readers, but we need to talk about Game Key cards. Is it necessary to complain about them every single time a new game is announced?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I understand the issue for game collectors and game preservation, but as a business practice it’s nothing new. Also, players across all platforms purchase far more digital games than physical these days.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>For those of us that have gone digital only for several years now, the constant complaint for Game Key cards feel similar to complaining about the lack of discs when new albums are released in Spotify or something.</p>
<p>I support you in your criticism of Game Key cards and I’ll keep reading the articles and watching the videos regardless if you mention Game Key or not. It just annoys me since I don’t agree that it’s as relevant to the average Nintendo gamer as the community makes it sound.</p>
<p>Now excuse me as I find somewhere to hide before the torches arrive. Thank you!<strong><br>
RenanKJ</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are rubbish, though, no?</p>
<p>Sure, it's irritating when people demand two points docked from a review score because Game Key-Card, as if modern games haven't been shipping with massive required downloads for a couple of generations. But if people want to voice their displeasure in a respectful manner, let's not crack out the copium just yet. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"I expect more"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How long has Sakarai needed a break for? Everytime his name comes up, any YouTuber or Journalist or random comment poster will say "Ah give that guy a break, he's worked too much." Well guess what? He had his break. The last DLC for Super Smash Bros Ultimate was released in October 2021. So it's time we stopped cutting the guy slack, he's rested and ready and it's about time he made Kirby Air Riders and then about time he made another Smash Bros after that! He is only 55, so I expect more and I don't feel guilty saying so. So come on Sakurai, let's have some more games son!<strong><br>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above).

<p>There are few games as well-known in the general population as <i>Fortnite</i>. Even your grandmother knows what it is because she’s bought your cousin $700 in V-Bucks over the past month so he can play as a hot dog or whatever. This beloved battle royale is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon, either. But maybe it’s been a little while since you’ve played or you’ve yet to jump out of your first party bus. Let’s get into what you need to know to get into <i>Fortnite</i> in 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what%e2%80%99s-the-deal-with-the-current-season"></span>What’s the deal with the current season?<span></span></h2> <p>At the time of this writing, <i>Fortnite</i> is up to Chapter 6, Season 4, which went live on August 7, 2025 and it features new characters from <i>Halo</i> and <i>Power Rangers</i>. We can expect this season to take us into the Fall of this year before the new one arrives.</p> <p>The current season sees a bit of a pest-control problem on the island. Throughout the map you’ll find various gross nests, eggs, and the like. There are also three queen insects you’ll need to take down to earn yourself a mythic weapon. For full details on these pests and where on the map you can expect to find them, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bad-bugs-bite-the-bullet-in-fortnite-battle-royale-shock-n-awesome?lang=en-US">check out the official blog post.</a></p>

 <h2><span id="what-are-the-best-guns-in-the-game-right-now"></span>What are the best guns in the game right now?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, it’s looking like it’s SMG season, folks. The Veiled Precision SMG is arguably at the top of the pack when it comes to mowing down your opponents. That said, the Deadeye DMR is also a great pick for those who like to place their shots with more precision. And if you’re into looking weird while taking out multiple foes at once, give the Bug Blaster a shot.</p> <h2><span id="what-got-vaulted/unvaulted"></span>What got vaulted/unvaulted?<span></span></h2> <p>This season sees the following changes to the game’s arsenal, as<a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1953357145140809934"> per Osirion on X</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BR LOOT POOL UPDATES</p> <p>unvaulted/added:<br>– Hammer Assault Rifle<br>– O.X.R.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield is Aiming to Become an Annual Release Within 5-6 Years, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-annual-releases/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-is-aiming-to-become-an-annual-release-within-5-6-years-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1272126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video, industry analyst Michael Pachter claims that the General Manager of the Battlefield franchise, Byron Beede, has told him that EA wants Battlefield to be an annual title.</p>



<p>According to Pachter, he has spoken to Beede, who said that EA’s goal is to have three studios working on the Battlefield franchise on a three-year cycle, so that they can release annually.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, this is identical to Call of Duty’s annual release model, but Pachter claims that the franchise is still 5-6 years away from back-to-back annual releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out directly to Byron Beede for comment, but as of yet has not heard a response.</p>



<p>You can watch Pachter’s claims below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Are PlayStation's &quot;prestige games&quot; now a poor strategy? - Pachter Factor S10E25" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_WuLcrpCkkc?start=405&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Personally, though, I find this hard to believe. Battlefield 6, which has been developed by four individual studios — DICE, Motive, Ripple Effect, and Criterion — appears to be on the path to success. However, I believe that an annual Battlefield release could significantly harm the franchise and its quality.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-battlefield-6-pre-order-bonuses-explained-every-tombstone-pack-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – All Battlefield 6 Pre-Order Bonuses Explained—Every Tombstone Pack Reward</a></strong></p>



<p>Could I see Battlefield releasing a new experience annually? Possibly, but not a new, fully-fledged game. Then and again, what a new experience after a Battle Royale looks like is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll finally give us that dinosaur mode that everyone has talked about for years.</p>



<p>What do you think of Pachter’s claims? Do you think Battlefield should adopt an annual release cycle? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/discounty</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-discounty-switch-chilled-out-supermarket-sim-is-a-decent-deal.1272105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158015/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>No one who has ever worked in retail would compare the experience to a cosy life management sim. I used to have nightmares about stock variance and queues of angry customers who seemed determined to ruin my day as much as they felt I had ruined theirs.</p>
<p>Yet, Danish developer Crinkle Cut Games seems to think that managing a busy supermarket is something people will enjoy doing on the couch or on the go. Thankfully, they wrapped a charming world around this premise, complete with a pixel art style and chill soundscape. Despite the hellish inspiration, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/discounty">Discounty</a> is almost good enough to be mentioned alongside genre luminaries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>, even though it doesn't do anything drastically different with the basic formula.</p>
<p>The story follows your created shopkeeper as they travel to the small town of Blomkest, where their aunt Tellar has been trying for years to get her franchise store off the ground. She believes your character, her newly arrived relative, is the key to building a thriving supermarket and tasks them with connecting trade across the community.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158012/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a fledgling store manager, you will order deliveries of various sundries and keep shelves stocked and organised. Once that open sign is flipped, the checkout needs to be manned and a steady flow of customers attended to. As items roll across the conveyor, you pull up a calculator to run price totals before checking orders out and seeing whether your customer service earns you an angry grumble or a delighted smile. A belt full of items can often screw up your calculations, and it doesn't help that the till UI is a bit fiddly.</p>
<p>Early on, the Discounty Corporation will introduce bonuses and performance reviews that reward stock variety and efficiency. Completing these challenges unlocks upgrades (like a till scanner to make your shift way easier), more types of produce and, as with any capitalist venture, more cash!</p>
<p>Much like ConcernedApe’s farming sim, Discounty draws you into a focused loop of familiar tasks before gradually expanding the world and involving you in the soap opera-like lives of the townspeople. Outside of work hours, you're free to wander Blomkest, exploring and chatting with the locals. Every aspect of the town ties back to the growth of your store in some way, whether through trade deals or side quests that open up new areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158020/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The cast is made up of mostly familiar archetypes, but there is still some amusing story content to enjoy. Early on, you will meet a crotchety fisherman with a grudge against the local cannery, who is monopolising his business. Other standouts include new age antique shop owner Solruna and little old lady Andersson. There’s also a mysterious tension between your aunt and the resident bureaucrat, Elmer. These little story vignettes are well written and often very funny.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about Discounty’s take on the cosy management sim is that it keeps the supermarket management front and centre. It’s a streamlined experience without the distractions of romance or extracurricular activities. Each customer has a series of story objectives to complete, but these usually amount to little more than finding someone and talking to them. Then it’s back to the shop floor to get (and sell) this bread.</p>
<p>For those who want to explore the generous depths of shop management with minimal distractions, this leaner format will be welcome. However, if you enjoyed the mini-games and love stories found in games like Stardew or the excellent (In my eyes, at least) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/graveyard_keeper">Graveyard Keeper</a>, you might be disappointed. The opportunity to automate a lot of the busywork is there, allowing you to spend more time exploring the town. However, there really isn’t much to do besides building up your store. It's a shame that <em>Crinkle Cut</em> chose to focus so heavily on shop management while cutting much of the side content that keeps games like this engaging over time.</p>
<figure><a title="Discounty Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The town of Blomkest both looks and sounds lovely. While the aesthetic is reminiscent of genre peers, Crinkle Cut has added its own visual spin. I especially liked the sense of motion in my shopkeeper’s bobbing head. The musical themes are good enough to cope with the strain of repetition and hum along to, as well. Special mention to the visceral sound effects in the shop, which may send former or current retail workers into a spiral.</p>

<p>Discounty is a solid addition to the Switch’s healthy stable of cosy sims. These games feel right at home on a console you can take anywhere, with a bite-sized day cycle that works just as well for long sessions as it does for quick breaks. Growing your supermarket is a deep and satisfying experience, but getting involved in your customers lives can be a bit shallow. But, most importantly, Discounty manages the impossible task of making retail work fun and relaxing, and that's a feat in itself.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In a recent episode of <em>Post Games</em>, host Chris Plante explores how video games can help players understand death. He’s interviewing Kaitlin Tremblay, who is working on <em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a game about death.</p><p>“What is it about games that is so useful for exploring the topic?” Plante asks.</p><p>“I think there’s something really lovely about the way in which games invite players in,” Tremblay says. There is “something quite lovely about asking a person to cooperate and to be a part of the story, and to move through the space.”</p><p>It’s a tone, and a substance of conversation, unlike any I’ve heard on a gaming podcast before. And it underscores what’s so unique about <em>Post Games</em> — and how it might stand out from other gaming media, by acting a lot more like a slower and more cerebral NPR show.</p><p>Within weeks of leaving <em>Polygon</em>, where he was the editor-in-chief, Plante started <em>Post Games</em>, which he <a href="https://postgame.substack.com/">describes as</a> “a weekly podcast about how and why we love video games.” He’s targeting an older demographic and models <em>Post Games</em> after an NPR-like format with tightly-edited segments and weekly episodes that last for about an hour. And he’s asking fans for support via Patreon to help keep it going.</p><div><p>“Practically everything in games media targets young people”</p></div><p>Many other video game podcasts are “almost entirely for people under the age of 30 who can afford to listen to multiple shows that are four hours long this week,” Plante tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Practically everything in games media targets young people — both because it’s being produced by young people and because it’s the demographic sales teams believe they have the best shot at selling.” But players over 35, he says, have “very different interests and expectations.” There are a lot of people that fall in that category, with the Entertainment Software Association <a href="https://www.theesa.com/annual-esa-study-reveals-video-games-universal-appeal-across-generations/">reporting that</a> more than half of the 205.1 million Americans playing video games are older than 35.</p><p>“It’s really basic supply and demand shit,” he says. “And yet very few places want to meet this demand. The publications older audiences turn to for information — newspapers, magazines, and audio — have given gaming culture scraps at best, and worst, ignored it entirely.”</p><p>Before I go any further, I should make a few disclosures. Plante, until May, was the editor-in-chief of <em>Polygon</em>, formerly <em>The Verge</em>’s sister site dedicated to gaming and entertainment. He was a co-founder of <em>Polygon</em> when it launched in 2012, and he later worked at <em>The Verge</em> from September 2014 to July 2017. I never worked with him directly, but I met Plante for the first time in person earlier this year over dinner at the Game Developers Conference.</p><p>This is all to say that when Vox Media announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">on May 1st</a> that it sold <em>Polygon</em> to <em>Game Rant</em> owner Valnet, and Plante said that he <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">wouldn’t be</a> part of the site moving forward, I was bummed for him. But by the end of the month, he had published the first episode of <em>Post Games</em>, and he’s posted a new episode every week since. It’s a great podcast.</p><p>Each episode is about an hour long and split into three acts. Much of the show revolves around interviews on a certain topic, and a third act features Plante discussing the news of the week. But the broader topics of the episodes don’t always align with the current big thing in gaming.</p><p>The first episode was about the history of the Independent Games Festival’s Seamus McNally Grand Prize, for example. The second was about sexy games. When the episodes do tackle topics of the moment, Plante tries to put his own spin on things; when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a> came out, Plante scored a rare interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/videogamedunkey">videogamedunkey</a>, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukqZ5VOoK5s">initially hated</a> the first <em>Death Stranding</em> but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONfg5qeK_mI">revisited it two years later</a>.</p><p>The show is available for free with ads, but people who pay a $5 per month subscription <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/PostGames/home">on Patreon</a> get early access to ad-free episodes with a bonus segment and access to an exclusive video every month. While planning out what <em>Post Games</em> would be “my logic was, if I wasn’t willing to spend $5 on it, then why would anybody else?” Plante says. The show just hit 1,000 paid subscribers, and even if things flatten from there, “that would be enough to cover my family’s health insurance.” If the show gets 2,000 by the end of the year, “I’ll feel confident about this being my future.”</p><p>Game journalists who leave or were laid off from traditional gaming publications are increasingly doing their own thing, such as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23949269/aftermath-video-games-kotaku-defector">worker-owned <em>Aftermath</em> from former <em>Kotaku</em> writers</a> and Patrick Klepek’s <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/">parent-focused <em>Crossplay</em></a> Substack publication. And while publications everywhere are facing pressure from things like AI search engines and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience">Google Zero</a>, Plante argues there are a lot of audiences that are underserved by more traditional business models because of their reliance on scale.</p><p>“As somebody in the media, you hear a lot about how great independent media is because of its benefits for the people who make the media, but I think there’s a larger conversation that needs to be had about the benefits that it has for the audience, for the readers,” Plante says. “I think if you focus on the readers and the audience, you will find more business opportunities for more independent creators or more just smaller funded creators.” He also says that if mainstream publications don’t want to serve the “humongous and growing audience” of older gamers, “I’m happy to.”</p><p>Plante sees <em>Post Games</em> as his thing for the next long while. “My only dream for the future of the show is that I’m doing this in 10 years,” he says.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760244/chris-plante-post-games-podcast-old-gamers-polygon]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d89a19f59ee34/super-adventure-island-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/warioware_inc_mega_microgameusd">WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$</a> for the GBA – a true classic and one of our favourites here at NL Towers. North America and Europe joined forced against Japan and, uh... Oh, poor Japan. The western design won with a whopping 91% of the vote! We quite like the Japanese design, there's definitely something to it. Though if you said it was boring, we wouldn't necessarily disagree. Hm.</p>
<p>Anyway, this week, we're going back to the SNES to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>. Developed by Produce! and published by Hudson Soft in 1992, it boasted some really lovely, colourful visuals and the platforming gameplay was pretty decent.</p>
<p>It's a three-way brawl this week folks, so get ready to vote, vote, vote!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:16309 @ 1755486803 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/538a5c2430ae3/super-adventure-island-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, so starting with North America, the artistic approach here is wildly different to that seen in Europe and Japan. After the initial whiplash, however, it's actually quite a cool image. More details become apparent the longer you look at it, like the characters in the background, the mine cart track swooping off into the distance, the 'leafy' title font... It's pretty cool.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4a2a3a2c93c36/super-adventure-island-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island-warioware-inc-mega-microgame">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So this one is a lot more, shall we say, 'cartoon-ish' than the North American variant. There are a handful of characters taking up the composition, including a couple of rather delightful turtles wearing shades. It's definitely a lot more colourful, although we'll have to dock a point for the rather boring title font.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Super Adventure Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8138a55c4a9c5/super-adventure-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1979-super-adventure-island">Hudson Soft / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Utilising the portrait orientation of the SNES packaging in Japan, this variant uses the same art style seen in Europe's design, but the added space allows for a lot more characters to be depicted. The giant skeleton thing on the right really draws the eye, and the use of colour is perhaps even more effective here.</p>
