		<p>Ubisoft has delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> once again, nudging the launch date back by around a month. The new Assassin’s Creed Shadows release date is 20th March 2025, the game coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p>Speaking for the Assassin’s Creed team, executive producer Marc-Alexis Coté said:</p>


<p><em>We want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our incredible fans and dedicated teams for your unwavering support since our announcement in September to further refine and polish Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</em></p>
<p><em>Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us. Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Accordingly, the new release date is</em> <strong><em>March 20, 2025</em></strong><em>. We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams.</em></p>

<p><em>We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!</em></p>
<p>Previously planned for launch at the tail end of 2024, Ubisoft delayed AC Shadows to 14th February in the wake of a disappointing release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. “While the game is feature complete,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february/">Ubisoft said of AC Shadows in September last year</a>, “the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title.”</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes us back to 16th century Japan during the Azuchi-Momoyama era, featuring a female ninja and a male samurai for its lead characters. That man is a historical character based off Yasuke, a man of African origin who was one of the rare immigrants to Japan and who served Oda Nobunaga.&nbsp;The female ninja is named Naoe from Iga Province, who is inducted into the local Assassin’s order to battle all those dastardly Templars.</p>
<p>Her story will be intertwined with that of Yasuke, letting you master complimentary playstyles as both characters have contrasting abilities – Naoe for stealth, Yasuke for direct combat. This will be a fresh take on the twin protagonists that we’ve seen on occasion through the Assassin’s Creed series.</p>
<p>Grabbing an extra month for the final rounds of polish means that&nbsp;Assassin’s Creed Shadows is also avoiding going up directly against <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">Avowed</a>, both of which had shifted from their own late 2024 release plans – Avowed specifically trying to avoid other big game launches, and is now getting a bit lucky with that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20-while-ubisoft-appoints-advisors-to-review-potential-company-sale/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf?_gl=1*o6yy2l*_gcl_au*MTI5Nzc0NTY1Ni4xNzM2NDQxODU1*_ga*ODQ5NjQ1NDM2LjE3MzY0NDE4NTU.*_ga_C4N5020N2R*MTczNjQ0MTg1NC4xLjAuMTczNjQ0MTg1NC42MC4wLjA." target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> another delay for Assassin's Creed Shadows. Originally slated to launch on November 15, 2024, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered the first delay to February 14</a> as Ubisoft attempted to avoid the same fates of Star Wars Outlaws and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora. Now, the game has been pushed back to March 20, once again with the goal of providing a better game at launch.</p>
<p>With the same note, the publisher revealed that it had appointed advisors to review 'transformational strategic and capital options to create the best value for stakeholders.' Translating from investor speak, they will counsel the company on the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> potential sale options. This review process will be overseen by the independent members of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Ubisoft, stated:</p>
<p><em>We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future. We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximize value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>Additionally, we are all behind our teams’ efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin’s Creed</em><br>
<em>opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to</em><br>
<em>Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months</em><br>
<em>that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong</em><br>
<em>note.</em></p>
<p>The importance of a successful launch for Assassin's Creed Shadows cannot be overstated. In today's report, Ubisoft also revealed that Q3 FY2024-25 net bookings will be lower than expected (at around €300 million) due to lower-than-anticipated Holiday sales, mainly for Star Wars Outlaws, as well as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discontinuation of XDefiant</a>, planned for June.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ubisoft is continuing its cost-reduction process. The publisher now expects to exceed €200 million in reduction of its fixed cost base by FY2025-26 vs. FY2022-23 on an annualized basis. In December,&nbsp;three production studios in high-cost geographies were closed.</p>

            <p>The first time I died in Beyond Citadel, the game treated to me a close-up shot of my character's scantily clad, bisected body lying in a pool of guts and ripped underwear. It turns out you can turn off a lot of the gore and nudity. You can also swaddle yourself in some nice, sturdy, PG-13 body armor. But you're seemingly stuck with a certain base percentage of bulging, softcore gratuitousness in both the character portrait on bottom left, and in the mildly boobulent background art of the world. I'm not sure I can put up with all that, which is a shame, because Beyond Citadel is otherwise a promising, eerie FPS that mixes ideas from 90s shooters in pretty appealing ways.</p><!--more-->

<p>As the name suggests, Beyond Citadel is a sequel to The Citadel, which launched in 2020. It's the work of Japanese developer doekuramori, who I'm not familiar with. The premise: it is Armageddon O' Clock. You are the Martyr, gun-toting anime girl agent of seven guardian angels. Your task is to "cancel the apocalypse" by defeating the forces of the rapacious Trumpeters, and unearthing the buried secrets of humankind's final stronghold.</p>
<p>"Cancel the apocalypse" is seemingly a reference to Pacific Rim, but I have yet to meet Idris Elba in Beyond Citadel. His agent probably wouldn't let him anywhere near a hot potato like this. In any case, the more appropriate parallel here is surely Neon Genesis Evangelion, with its hyper-depressive Biblical imagery and penchant for grotesquely magnified bodily suffering.</p><p>Based on the Steam demo, the world is a mixture of rolling, external wastelands and square, multiple-elevation corridors and chambers where you'll play find-the-keycard, and also disembowel-the-demon. The gunplay is broadly Doom-to-Dark-Forces, but with corner-peeking and ironsight aiming. You also get options to make the handling more elaborate. You can turn on weapon deterioration, which might cause guns to jam, and there's a manual reload feature where you have to cock the firearm after feeding in shells. I love this latter system: it makes life harder, of course, but it creates a satisfying tempo and makes the combat feel more intricate and tactile. I like when video game guns go clicky-clack, perhaps even more than when they go boom.</p>
<p>I also like the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lucah-born-of-a-dream">Lucah: Born Of A Dream</a> and its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a>. It's a universe of dense runes, gangrene-daubed monoliths, and hollow-eyed anime people slumped in attitudes of foreboding and despair. The menus and intermission screens consist of drawings of additional, hollow-eyed anime people, all of them huddled up gripping battleaxes and rifles while showing a lot of thigh.</p>
<p>There is plenty to read, with in-game writing that ranges from clipped computer logs to snippets of scripture. The English localisation is a bit scruffy, but it doesn't seem any more obscure than it intends to be. God is dead, I gather. "0-919 activation in process". Truth lies below.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/20250109150112_1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>doekuramori</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'm always keen on video games that involve a relentless descent through layers of mounting unearthliness, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>. In this case, looking down a shaft to the next area also means gazing directly into your character's pixelart cleavage. Which doesn't feel like an accident, on the developer's part. I suspect there's something more thoughtful to say about the relationship between the game's themes and its borderline-absurdist nudity and gore, perhaps touching on the ethereal, alien symbology of anime girls in general, but I'm not sure I'm the best writer for the job.</p>
<p>Still, I like Beyond Citadel's gunplay and spaces enough that I'll probably play a little more. I'll let you know if it proves worth the journey, but if you're convinced already, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3371240/Beyond_Citadel/">you can buy it on Steam right now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The next entry in Ubisoft’s popular and long-running series, <em>Shadows </em>takes the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> formula to Japan, a location fans have wanted for years. It also has two playable protagonists, a feature last seen in 2015's <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>. However, one of these characters—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..">famous Black samurai Yasuke</a></span>—was at the center of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820">manufactured controversy</a></span> among parts of the internet over his race and depiction in the game. </p><p>There were also legitimate concerns about how the game looked and played in previews, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-launch-delayed-february-2025-ubisoft-1236155666/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-launch-delayed-february-2025-ubisoft-1236155666/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">following the mixed reception to <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span> last year, Ubisoft announced an uncharateristic delay for the franchise, pushing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> back from November 2024 to February 2025 to provide the devs with more time to improve the game.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s release date brings with it bloodshed and battles. Warhorse Studio’s brand of historical warfare and realism has proven to be successful, so we’re here to take a look at Deliverance 2’s launch window and available platforms.</p>



<p>The first visit to Kingdom Come wasn’t overly loved by critics, but fans loved it. Its developer revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance has sold 8 million copies</a> and counting. The 2018 RPG made its mark, and then some. Now, the eagerly awaited sequel is preparing to unsheath its blade and plunge it deep into any who have the gall to come back for a second helping.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest releases coming in early 2025</a>, and is set to wrap up the events of the original.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-s-release-date">When is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An epic war is coming. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is scheduled to launch on February 4</strong>.</p>



<p>It was announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-one-week-earlier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deliverance 2 would be released a week earlier</a> than planned, and it’s set to expand on almost everything that made the original so popular.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has been hard at work on the sequel since the first game dropped. The studio has grown from 11 people to over 250, and Deliverance 2 is what the company wanted the original to be like—from the words of creative director Daniel Vávra in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R48DEEjyS5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s Official Game Reveal Trailer</a>.</p>



<p>There’s improved NPC behavior, better real-world interactions, an emphasis again on sleep and food, and new weapons are included such as crossbows and firearms.</p>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-time">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Release Time</h2>



<p><strong>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is likely to be released at midnight worldwide</strong>—unless Warhorse Studios says otherwise.</p>



<p>Most games have a universal midnight release schedule for each region. Deliverance 2 doesn’t seem to be any different, so, for the time being, presume Delliverance 2 is releasing at midnight in your time zone. If you’re in New Zealand, you’re laughing, anywhere else, and you’re playing catch up!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-platforms">All Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s day-one launch platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor (for now), Deliverance 2 is restricted purely to next-gen consoles and formats. 2018’s first entry has versions on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Amazon Luna, and Nintendo Switch. The final format on this list was a newcomer—only debuting on Jun. 10, 2021—which means Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 could opt for extra platforms in the future as well.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ve already described the newest Kingdom Come as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Purest Evolution of a Stellar RPG” in our preview</a>. Do you think it can live up to the original? Or is it going to be a King without a Kingdom?</p>



<p>Keep up to date with everything Deliverance 2 including its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC specs</a> and how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immersive</a> the sequel is shaping up to be. </p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed yet again. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is being delayed from its February 14 release date to March 20.</p>



<p>In a statement <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1877400048314528126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>, Marc-Alexis Côté says that the game needs “additional weeks” to implement changes based on feedback received from players during testing.</p>



<p>“Since November, we’ve been thrilled to share our progress through Gameplay Overviews, and the overwhelming excitement has truly inspired us,” he said. “Each week has brought valuable feedback from our community. While we’ve already made remarkable strides, we believe a few additional weeks are needed to implement that feedback and ensure an even more ambitious and engaging day-one experience.”</p>



<p>He continued: “We remain committed to delivering a high-quality, immersive experience—fostered by ongoing dialogue between our players and development teams. We know you’re eager to learn more about Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and we’re excited to share that more updates will be coming your way very soon!”</p>







<p>On top of Côté’s statement, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said in a press release that the decision to delay the game again was “part of the renewed focus on gameplay quality and engaging Day-1 experiences.”</p>



<p>Côté also thanked the studio’s “incredible fans and dedicated teams” for their support after first delaying Shadows from November  2024 to February 2025 back in September. You can read his full statement below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft has said it is delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> again, as the company explores sale options.
</p>
<p>
The highly-anticipated next Assassin's Creed game will now launch on 20th March. Previously the game was set to arrive on 14th February, after its initial delay from November 2014.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft said today that it was currently "taking decisive steps" to reshape the company and had now appointed advisors to "review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In plain English, it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">Ubisoft is indeed investigating options for a sale</a>, as suggested by several reports late last year. In December, news agency Reuters reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-discussing-buyout-options-with-tencent">Ubisoft was discussing buyout options with Chinese giant Tencent, already a major shareholder, that would take the company private</a>.
</p>
<p>
Going forward, Ubisoft expects to it will "continue to drive significant cost reductions, together with a
highly selective approach to investments". The suggestion seems to be of a continued narrowing of the company's focus, teams and output. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's statement notes the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">recently-confirmed end of shooter XDefiant in December</a>, and the subsequent closure of three studios "in high-cost geographies". 
</p>
<p>"We learned a lot, of course, from this journey," Ubisoft said in a conference call this evening attended by Eurogamer, discussing the end of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>, "but we believe it was the difficult but right decision".</p>
<p>
In terms of investments, Ubisoft's statement points to the additional five weeks given to Assassin's Creed Shadows, whose developers will now have more time to incorporate additional changes.
</p>
<p>
"This additional time will allow the team to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months and help create the best conditions for launch by continuing to engage closely with the increasingly positive Assassin's Creed community," Ubisoft said. 
</p>
<p>During this evening's call, Ubisoft added that it would begin giving some players access to Shadows next week, though the suggestion here was this referred to limited hands-on oppurtunities granted to select individuals.</p>
<p>
Ubisoft additionally said it has suffered "lower than expected holiday sales, mainly for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>" and had also lowered financial expectations due to the discontinuation of XDefiant.
</p>
<p>
"We made good progress on the strategic and execution reviews initiated a few months ago and are confident that this will position Ubisoft for a stronger future," Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said in a statement. "We have taken decisive steps to reshape the Group in order to deliver best-in-class player experiences, enhance operational efficiency and maximise value creation. We also recently appointed leading advisors and are actively exploring various strategic and capitalistic options to unlock the full value potential of our assets. We are convinced that there are several potential paths to generate value from Ubisoft's assets and franchises.
</p><p>
"Additionally, we are all behind our teams' efforts to create the most ambitious Assassin's Creed opus of the franchise and made the decision to provide an extra month of development to Shadows in order to better incorporate the player feedback gathered over the past three months that will enable us to fully deliver on the potential of the game and finish the year on a strong note."

The console didn’t end up launching, but at CES 2025, My Arcade is reviving it with an expected release later this year.</p><p>The design and functionality of the Super Retro Champ appears nearly identical to what My Arcade revealed in 2020, but as with many things now, it’s expected to be slightly more expensive. Instead of $110, the handheld is now priced at $149.99.</p><div><figcaption><em>Super Nintendo cartridges end up slightly sticking out of the top of the handheld, while Sega Genesis carts sit flush in its bottom slot.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>Unlike the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24236829/analogue-pocket-handheld-gaming-game-boy-color">Analogue Pocket</a>, which can play retro titles using cartridges or ROM files, the Super Retro Champ is similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24303052/modretro-chromatic-review-game-boy-color-handheld-palmer-luckey">ModRetro Chromatic</a> and sticks to carts. It’s got a slot on the top for SNES games (that end up slightly sticking out) and a second on the bottom for Genesis carts. It’s also compatible with cartridges released for the international versions of those classic consoles, including Super Famicom and Mega Drive games.</p><div><figcaption><em>It’s unlikely you’re ever going to find a pocket large enough to carry the Super Retro Champ.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: My Arcade</cite></p></div><p>With a six-inch screen surrounded by generous bezels plus a directional pad and action buttons on either side, the Super Retro Champ doesn’t prioritize portability. You can use it as a handheld with “hours of uninterrupted gameplay” from its rechargeable battery, My Arcade says, but it’s better suited for playing while propped up on a table using its folding stand, a pair of connected controllers, and a power adapter.</p><p>If six inches feels too cramped for you and another player, there’s also an HDMI port on the back of the Super Retro Champ for connecting it to a TV. Just don’t expect to enjoy your favorite 16-bit titles in HD or expect them to look as good as they did on the old CRT TV you grew up with.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And one of those maps includes what some fans are hoping is a tease for an upcoming hero: the sound-manipulating mutant Dazzler.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On the Midtown map, you can find a poster promoting Dazzler’s “Light the World” tour. The mutant daylights as a pop star, and it looks like she’s going on tour during the events of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. As Hoshi points out in the TikTok below, the poster also has Dazzler’s signature, which every hero has on their character’s lore page in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ menus.</p><figure id="" data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-recommend-id="image://629093eb6282528ef2b80a016339174a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1032" data-height="580" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dazzler sings into a microphone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The poster isn’t the only reference to Dazzler in the game right now. In a pre-match exchange over music, Star-Lord suggestively asks Luna Snow if she knows the pop star. Like Dazzler, Luna Snow is also a hero juggling a music career, so it would make sense if they’d crossed paths at some point. While these are only easter eggs for comic fans at the moment, some players are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/snoozeclock/status/1877064523774898446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hopeful</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OmniGulano/status/1877067026390221142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this means </a></span><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Teatitty/status/1877054180633858514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dazzler </a></span>could be bringing her sound-wielding powers to the hero shooter in the future. Come on, a music-based Luna Snow and Dazzler Team-Up ability is an easy pull. I went looking and it turns out fans have been making mock-ups of Dazzler’s hypothetical <em>Marvel Rivals</em> design for a bit.</p><p>Right now there are already a handful of X-Men in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it could certainly do with more. I can already envision Dazzler using her abilities to turn sound into light to produce a flashbang to temporarily blind enemies. However, NetEase is introducing Invisible Woman this season, whose kit also plays with visibility, albeit in a defensive manner rather than an offensive one. Should Dazzler make her way to the roster, it will likely not be any time soon as Season 1 is already bringing four heroes to the mix, with the Human Torch and the Thing set to follow Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman in the second half.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The upcoming open-world action RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is releasing on PC after all. </p>



<p>After first being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-mobile-game-is-launching-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed for iOS and Android</a> at The Game Awards 2024, developer Netmarble has confirmed the game will launch on Windows. The confirmation came via an announcement for <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en/cbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">closed beta signups</a> that added PC to the available platforms. </p>



<p>Alongside the beta announcement came a list of minimum PC specs that players need. those include an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, 8GB of memory, 30GB of storage space, Windows 10/11, and at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT graphics card.</p>



<p>Regarding the Game of Thrones: Kingsroad closed beta, it will take place from January 16-22 and be on both PC and mobile. It will feature the first look at the land of Westeros, three classes to try,  and a look at the original story developed specifically for the game. Those who take part in the beta will receive exclusive rewards after the game’s full launch later this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, the game features a new original story that starts with the dead of King Robert Baratheon.</p>



<p>“As the Lannisters desperately cling to the Iron Throne, the war between those who would claim it for themselves hurtles towards its final act,” the <a href="https://gameofthrones.netmarble.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">story reads</a>. “The king’s brother, Stannis Baratheon, gathers his forces for a final assault, while the vast, frozen lands of the North smolder after the betrayal at the Red Wedding.”</p>



<p>According to Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad also features a “realistic manual combat system” that requires you to defeat enemies using “strategic combos”.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is almost here. Scheduled for release in less than two months, the game’s promotional campaign is in full swing.</p>



<p>Aware of the huge hype for the game, IGN brought the title to its <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN First</a> panel. The show is dedicated to revealing new information about highly anticipated games. In the videos released today, they provided details of two monsters: Ajakaran and Rompopolo.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the videos, the two monsters reside in the Oilwell Basin area. A volcanic ecosystem full of caves, tar pits, oil lakes and large thermal vents that spew out smoke and other gases. The region is home to the Azuz Tribe. They use the region’s characteristics to produce energy and weapons. The region’s Apex monster is called the Black Flame, however, no further details about the monster have been revealed yet.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Rompopolo Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yp-28fhhOs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As we can see in the videos above, the Ajarakan resembles a Flaming Gorilla with a carapace and the Rompopolo resembles a mosquito fused with a mantis. Both monsters are new to Wilds. According to the game’s Wiki, they are very territorial and often fight each other.</p>



<p>The Rompopolo usually buries its tail in mud and oil to cause gas explosions, while the Ajarakan is strong and agile, using its aggression to unleash flaming attacks.</p>



<p>Scheduled for release on February 28th, the next game in the franchise is one of the most anticipated games of 2025. It will come as no surprise if it ends up being nominated for the best game of the year. Judging by all the materials released so far, the game looks spectacular. Of course, we’ll have to see it in action next month!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Xbox has announced a new Developer_Direct stream will take place on Thursday 23rd January at 6PM GMT, giving an inside look at some of the biggest games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> in 2025</p>
<p>The Developer_Direct will focus on four games from across Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda and one third party title that Microsoft has cosied up to. Three of these games are known with one additional secret…</p>


<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them, visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and to id Studios for a look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Lastly, they’ll visit a surprise studio to see a brand new game.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is obviously the headline act, a prequel tale to the acclaimed 2016 Doom and Doom Eternal, which sees us head back in time to see where the Doom Slayer came from, waging a more medieval war on Hell.</p>
<p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, comes from the makers of We Happy Few, but is a very different style of game, a third person action-adventure game set in the American Deep South. Playing as Hazel, you’ll dive into a flooded world that takes deep inspiration from folklore to unravel a hidden past.</p>

<p>A Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a gorgeous looking turn-based RPG from French studio Sandfall interactive, seeing you lead a team on a last-ditch effort to foil the Paintress and stop her from wiping out yet another age group, turning them into dust. Who does she think she is? Thanos?</p>
<p>Microsoft has made a tradition out of hosting a developer showcase in January to start off the year, looking at games for the year ahead. January 2024 saw them reveal <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> gameplay, give a deep dive into the gameplay of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avowed">Avowed</a> (which was eventually postponed to February 2025), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</a>.</p>

			<p>A new trailer today has been published, showcasing the world of Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition. The game will be arriving on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2025. For those who are fans of the Xenoblade Universe, this is a massive opportunity and upgrade for the title, as it was previously released in 2015 on the Wii U. Now, the sci-fi RPG will be coming to the Nintendo Switch with new story elements to dive into, new characters to love (or hate), new Skell and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-comparison/">enhanced visuals</a>. Below is the brand-new trailer for Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition – The year is 2054… (Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2nQgIm3PJFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game takes place in the year 2054, when the Earth has been destroyed by a war between two alien races, and it means that humanity is close to becoming extinct. A number of survivors crash land on the planet Mira, and it becomes your job to restore humanity and give them a fighting chance again.</p>
<p>As you explore Mira and get to see all of the different environments, you'll also get your own Skell, which is a powerful exoskeleton that can fly, transform into a vehicle, and give you great strength in battle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-wallace-gromit-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix and FuturLab have revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>crossover DLC, and this time around, it's beloved Aardman animation&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>'s time to shine.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer, the<em>&nbsp;PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>DLC will take you to the iconic 62 West Wallaby Street to clean some of the absent-minded inventor's most prized possessions, as well as the likes of Gromit's kennel and more.</p>

<p>The DLC's new Steam page promises to take you "from charming British suburbs to cheesy celestial bodies", so it sounds like you'll be able to visit the moon from the duo's inaugural adventure&nbsp;<em>A Grand Day Out</em>. Cracking!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wallace-gromit-dlc-powerwash-simulator-house.jpg?itok=Q-sh4sMw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wallace-gromit-dlc-powerwash-simulator-house.jpg?itok=7A4JOkqs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>-themed DLC soon.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know how many locations will be featured in the DLC, but as with other&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>DLC packs, there will presumably be a number of different levels on offer.</p>

<p>It might stand a chance of being the strangest, but this <i>PowerWash Simulator Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</i>DLC is far from the game's first crossover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It joins the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-shrek-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Shrek</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, and, of course,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, all of which have offered up their various vestiges and objects for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>&nbsp;to hose down.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't yet have a release date for the&nbsp;<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit&nbsp;</em>pack, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3077590/PowerWash_Simulator__Wallace__Gromit_Special_Pack/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to keep up with it.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, well, I'm sure you can guess what it is, but in case you need a refresher, it's a work sim-style game in which you must hose down various unclean locations and objects.</p>

<p>Playing either by yourself or alongside your friends, you can clean dirt from interiors and exteriors alike, taking satisfaction in a job well done. It's very much a relaxing, combat-free experience, unless you count the battle of water versus dirt as combat.</p>

<p><em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1290000/PowerWash_Simulator/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/powerwash-simulator/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/powerwash-simulator/9NHDJC0NW20M" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

The gameplay is that of a third-person shooter in a semi-open world. The most eye-catching part of the footage is that Bumblebee can transform between a robot and a car on the fly in what seems like a pretty seamless and satisfying animation to control. Traversal looks like it might have been a big part of <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, and it probably had the potential to play off of the core ability at the heart of the Hasbro toy franchise in interesting ways. </p><p>An executive for the company had previously said the game was shaping up well. <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> would be a “milestone for<em> Transformers</em> in the next year or two” that “nailed the feeling of playing as a massive, bipedal robot,” senior VP of digital strategy and licensing for Hasbro, Eugene Evans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span> in early 2024. </p><p>Who knows whether the rest of the game around that core gameplay premise would have been fun or worthwhile. Making all of the disparate bits of game work together in a satisfying and worthwhile way is one of the biggest design and technical challenges of making any game, and maybe <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> was ultimately canceled because it just wasn’t coming together, at least in a timeframe Hasbro was willing to foot the bill for. </p><p>“This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people,” Splash Damage <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in its statement this week</a></span>. “We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on <em>Transformers </em>for their dedication and passion. Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to showing off the game’s sprawling alien planet geography and setting up the stakes for its sci-fi story, the trailer also gives longtime fans a glimpse of new content, including a section of<em> Chrono Trigger</em>-esque floating islands teased at the very end which weren’t part of the original game. </p><p>But the most important addition to the 2015 game is probably the reworking its UI seems to have gotten. The on-screen HUDs for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles </em>games are notoriously busy and tiny, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was perhaps the series’ worst offender of all with tiny character portraits and stat bars on the left side of the screen while ability cooldowns were wedged in along the bottom. </p><p>In the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, the fonts are bigger, things are more spread out, and there’s more information on the screen explaining what bonuses players will get from what abilities, as well as a combo guide for the game’s all-important but very obtuse Overdrive system. It’s still busy but a lot easier to parse, and will hopefully be part of an overall attempt to make <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>’s myriad systems easier to navigate for new players. </p><p>The trailer also ends with a look at a hooded figure on a beach, suggesting new story content is coming that might continue the decade-old Wii U game’s story. Fans are already speculating that it might be on the level of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>'s <em>Future Redeemed</em> expansion, which helped tie that game into the other entries in the franchise. At the very least it looks like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> will be a complete package worthy of the Switch’s final year as Nintendo’s main console. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/one-of-the-most-blatant-pokemon-rip-offs-can-now-be-wishlisted-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the most blatant Pokémon rip-offs is now available to be wishlisted on Steam. Insider Gaming was recently contacted by the developers behind “Fay Keeper,” a brand-new creature-catching game where players collect and battle hundreds of creatures called “Fays.” The request was for a paid partnership – and in the current game industry climate it’s an opportunity that comes few and far between.</p>



<p>Yet, having looked at the game initially, we couldn’t help but feel inclined that the game is a blatant rip-off of Pokémon.</p>



<p>From the color pallet to the creatures themselves, the comparisons are strikingly similar, and although it’s clear that the developers want to capitalize on an itching Pokémon audience on the PC, I can’t help but feel the team is likely going to run into legal issues. You even get your very own “Faydex.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming compiled a couple comparisons between Fay Keeper and Pokémon below (click to enlarge) so you can muster your own opinions.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, the developers of the game have addressed them slightly on social media when asked by fans about the comparisons to Pokémon. BGS Studios doesn’t hide the fact that it takes inspiration from the classic franchise, but maintains that there will be enough differences between the titles to avoid any potential legal claims.</p>



<p>“Pokémon was a huge ref and the idea was for it to feel nostalgic, but me and the team are working on a lot of unique features that Pokémon games never had,” <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861816033549443480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one post reads</a>.</p>



<p>In another response to a question regarding copyright, <a href="https://x.com/FayKeeper/status/1861906032097718607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BGS Studios said</a>, “Although we took inspiration from a very nostalgic reference, every single pixel and line of code is being made from scratch by us. We’ll also have mechanics that were never in the original ref, so it will hit close while also being a different thing.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming did reach out to BGS Studios for further comment on the similarities, and to talk about any potential worries or concerns. Those attempts, however, have gone unanswered as of publishing.</p>



<p>What do you think of the similarities between Fay Keeper and Pokémon? Do you think this could lead to problems down the road?
