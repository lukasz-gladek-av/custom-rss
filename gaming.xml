            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> currently has over 80 games in development, with plans to release a game a month to its subscribers from this month onwards.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2024/Jul/18/netflix-inc-usa-244e80f7-c939-40a1-a316-82d7d29f8a40.pdf">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix's co-CEO, president and director Gregory K Peters discussed the company's plans for gaming and how it will achieve growth.

</p>
<p>
Where the company is moving quickest is with interactive narrative games, which Peters describes as "easier to build". These are placed in the Netflix Stories narrative hub and it's here the company will be launching a new game each month based on popular series like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.

<p>

Peters promised Netflix has "lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead".
</p>
<p>
Netflix's fellow co-CEO, president and director Theodore A Sarandos also contributed to the gaming discussion. "I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable," he said. "I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the superfan a place to be in between seasons and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters and new storylines or new plot twist events, now you could do those kind of things and then they can then materialise in the next season or in the sequel to the film."
</p>
<p>
So far, Netflix has launched over one hundred games, though many of these are small in scope.
</p>
<p>
The Netflix mobile app includes a number of third-party games as part of the subscription, like Grand Theft Auto, Football Manager, and Sonic Mania, as well as original Interactive Stories based on Netflix shows like Love is Blind and Perfect Match.
</p>
<p>
Peters noted that, while Netflix had set itself "pretty aggressive engagement growth targets", which it's met, the impact on the overall business is "still quite small" - as is investment.
</p>
<p>
Now, then, "the job is to continue to grow that engagement to the place where it has a material impact on the business," he said.
</p>
<p>
At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-developing-over-10-games-in-house-currently">Netflix head of gaming Mike Verdu revealed the company had over 10 games in development</a> at in-house studios, plus 90 games planned through deals with external teams.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the exact split is between in-house and third-party games for the 80 now in development, or what's changed since last year.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/kamiyas-still-keen-to-make-okami-viewtiful-joe-sequels-even-if-publisher-isnt</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kamiyas-still-keen-to-make-okami-viewtiful-joe-sequels-even-if-publisher-isnt.933396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/kamiyas-still-keen-to-make-okami-viewtiful-joe-sequels-even-if-publisher-isnt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Outspoken former Capcom director Hideki Kamiya has said he feels a "duty" to develop sequels to cult classics Okami and Viewtiful Joe in order to finish off their respective stories. 
</p>
<p>
In his latest video with fellow Capcom alum Ikumi Nakamura, Kamiya asks Capcom again for the ability to return to his former franchises.
</p>
<p>
"Creators have the duty to create sequels fans are wanting to see," Kamiya said. "Although I sound all high and mighty, it's been a while since I've moved on from Okami. But I still feel like I haven't fulfilled my duty. So Capcom-san, please, let's do it together.
</p>
<p>
"Same sentiments for Viewtiful Joe 3," Kamiya continued. "I'd be more than happy."
</p>
<p>
The video is light-hearted, and Kamiya acknowledges he is no longer anything to do with Capcom's own business decisions. Indeed, the director points out that he recently contacted Capcom to complain there was no option to pick Viewtiful Joe in a survey of franchises they'd like to see continue. 
</p>
<p>
"What the hell, Capcom?" Kamiya said in response.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Kamiya is well aware of the business reasons why Okami and Viewtiful Joe are not getting new installments today. 
</p>
<p>
"It's only because eight people have played Viewtiful Joe that people aren't going wild," Kamiya joked. "That game also ended mid-way. So I need to finish it."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, in a previous video, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Kamiya described Okami's initial sales as a "huge failure"</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Still, Kamiya seems keen. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm unemployed right now, but not super unemployed," he noted. "I haven't retired as a game creator."
</p>
<p>
Kamiya most recently served as a writer and supervising director on Bayonetta 3 and spin-off Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, continuing to play a part in the series he originally directed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">Kamiya departed developer PlatinumGames in October last year</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">issues of "trust"</a>, and it's unclear what the developer is up to now.
</p>
<p>The director has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-say-he-may-take-his-ideas-for-the-series-to-the-grave-with-him">previously said he would take his ideas for future Bayonetta games "to the grave"</a> with him.

		<p>Heihachi Mishima is making a comeback in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tekken-8">Tekken 8’s</a> third DLC, Bandai Namco has announced to cap off Evo 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 - Heihachi Mishima Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It seems that reports of his death were greatly overstated, as Heihachi will be coming to Tekken 8 this autumn as the third character in the Playable Character Year 1 Pass. He will follow on from Eddy, who arrived earlier this year, and Lidia, who <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/lidia-sobieska-joins-tekken-8-from-july-22nd/">is joining the game’s roster this week</a>. Heihachi is a nice surprise, given the previous leaks and rumours had suggested that&nbsp;Craig Marduk and Fahkumram were the other characters in the season pass.</p>
<p>Sweetening the pot even further, Tekken 8 will also get a post-release story expansion for the first time in the series’ history. Adding a new chapter, it will expand on The Dark Awakens storyline further, which features the battle between the Kazama and Mishima families. This new chapter will be available as a free update for all Tekken 8 players, and I’m sure it will have a really, really good and plausible explanation for how he has been brought back to life. That or the usual kind of comic book or soap opera shenanigans.</p>
<p>Was his mouth always that big, by the way? Not only that, but considering he was 76 years old in Tekken 7, that’s one seriously impressive set of chompers he’s still got. Then again, considering the ravages of time and the amount of fists and feet to the face he’s taken over the decades, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re dentures.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 review</a>, Nick wrote, “Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</p>
<p>Tekken 8 launched on 26th January 2024, and is available across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>

            <p>Heihachi Mishima, the mustachioed malevolence of the Tekken series, is going to be the next DLC character for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>. He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who <a href="https://youtu.be/3AZLtZ_AWlI?feature=shared&amp;t=172">threw him into a volcano</a>. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a>, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon. </p>

<p>As the third DLC character, Heihachi is due out sometime this autumn, but no hard release date has been confirmed. He follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-bot-in-tekken-8-is-demolishing-players-by-only-pressing-one-button-over-and-over">single-button reprobate</a> Eddy Gordo and Prime Minister of Poland Lydia Sobieska, both recently added to the game's roster.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell from the trailer, players are also getting an extra chapter of story mode attached to the old man, in which Heihachi is training a posse of hench monks to wavedash over burning coals. Very funny, Mr Mishima. Tekken 8 has "character episodes" for each playable biffer from the base game, but the newer DLC characters haven't got these. So it's nice to see that Eddy and Lydia also appear to feature heavily in whatever the old unkillable man is up to. The extra story chapter will be free to all players, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tekken/news/the-king-of-iron-fist-returns-tekken-8-first-ever-free-story-expansion-the-series">we're told</a>, whether you buy those characters or not.</p>
<p>Like I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, it's a solid biff 'em up. My main complaint (aside from lamenting the loss of a slower and more cagey style of play) was that my own particular favourite characters were nowhere to be seen. This is sadly still the case. I can't see relative C-listers Miguel or Josie coming any time soon. At least not before the likes of Marduk, Lucky Chloe, or Armor King. My best chance is to hold out for jokey supercop Lei Wulong, my go-to for silly fights and messing around. Ah, maybe next year. </p>
<p>Bandai Namco announced the auld curmudgeon's return at fighting game tournament EVO 2024, where the Tekken 8 finals saw Arslan Ash facing off against Atif Ijaz in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYdVpjah58M">a typically tense match</a> with lots of judicious use of the game's new Heat meter mechanic. So go watch that if you're curious about what high-level Tekkenizing looks like.</p>

            <p>
More Marvel vs Capcom games could be on the way, following the forthcoming Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection Arcade Classics announced at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">last month's Nintendo Direct</a>.

</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/exclusive-capcoms-dream-is-to-make-more-marvel-crossover-games-2831616/">Dexerto</a>, the collection's producer Shuhei Matsumoto discussed the future of the franchise.
</p>
<p>
"The development team at Capcom has big dreams," he said. "Maybe there is an opportunity for a new Marvel vs Capcom game. Maybe there is an opportunity for a new Capcom-based SNK game."
</p>

<p>
While he admitted he doesn't know if that will happen, in the short-term the team can "at least reintroduce these past legacy games to a new audience, to people who may not have the opportunity to play it, because it might not be out on modern or current platforms.
</p>
<p>
"What we can at least do now is to show that, hey, these series exist. We love these games.
We hope that you do too, and maybe in the future, if people get to familiarise themselves with these series, then there may be future opportunities to make bigger games."
</p>
<p>
Matsumoto said both Capcom and Marvel were keen on releasing the forthcoming collection, based in part due to fan interest in the series at competitive tournaments. In fact Capcom has been "in talks with Marvel for years" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
"[Marvel was] also on board," he said. "Because of that, it's kind of like the stars aligned. The timing was great, and now we are actually able to bring it to life. We're all very excited. And some of the inspiration about doing this was that Marvel took notice of community-based tournaments at places like Evo.
</p>
<p>
"With Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and other Marvel tournaments happening, they know that people really love the series and really want these games to be available on modern platforms, so now is the chance for them to do so."
</p>
<p>
Does this mean Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 could see a re-release, particularly with rollback netcode included?
</p>
<p>
"There's a lot of things that the team wants to do, and we have a lot of love for Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3," said Matsumoto. "Not just that, but other past fighting games that might not be supported with rollback or are available on a current platform. There's a lot we're looking forward to and big dreams, and now it's a matter of timing and seeing what we can do one step at a time."
</p>
<p>
Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection Arcade Classics will comprise seven games from the series, including Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter. It's coming to Switch, PS4, and Steam later this year.
</p>
<p>
Its reveal received a hugely positive response from fans, so a successful release could inspire Capcom further.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps fan demand could also inspire a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">Dino Crisis revival</a> - a recent poll by Capcom showed its the series fans most want to see return.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-service-games-get-ditched-too-soon-by-big-publishers-warfame-boss-says.933378/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-get-ditched-too-soon-by-big-publishers-warfame-boss-says<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>"You get terrified when you see the numbers drop."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Publishers hoping to launch the world's next big live service game often give up on projects too soon, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-review">Warframe</a> developer Digital Extremes has said. 
</p>
<p>
Live service games with so-so launches could still be salvaged  with more work, Digital Extreme's Steve Sinclair told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/big-publishers-eject-too-soon-from-live-service-titles-says-warframe-boss/">VGC</a>, rather than moving on and ditching years of progress.
</p>
<p>
"They think the release is make or break, and it's not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it," Sinclair said. "It comes out, doesn't work and they throw it away."
</p>
<p>
Warframe, which originally launched in 2013, is still going strong a decade on. But plenty of other live service games end up shutting in just a fraction of the time.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Avengers, published by Square Enix in 2020, is a recent example of this. Anthem, from Dragon Age and Mass Effect studio BioWare, is another. And currently there are concerns from fans that, due to low player numbers, Rocksteady's Suicide Squad will be next, after its first year of content concludes.
</p>
<p>
"Isn't that a shame when you put so many years of your life into iterating on those systems or building technology or building the start of a community, and because the operating costs are high, you get terrified when you see the numbers drop and you leave," Sinclair continued.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen this with amazing releases that I think have massive potential, and I think they eject too soon."
</p>
<p>
Presumably, Sinclair isn't reflecting on Digital Extremes' own business decisions here - such as its cancellation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-darkness-2-and-warframe-developer-announces-f2p-fps-keystone">The Amazing Eternals (formerly Keystone)</a>, a free-to-play online first-person shooter <a href="https://www.unseen64.net/tag/digital-extremes/">it ditched in 2017</a>, less than two months after it launched in beta.
</p>
<p>
"The competitive landscape at that time was pretty hefty," Digital Extremes' Meredith Braun said at the time. "We just saw [Cliff Bleszinski-made online FPS] LawBreakers not do so great, and it was a fantastic game, so that was sad. That happened right when we were starting our closed beta for Amazing Eternals."
</p>
<p>This weekend we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-1999-expansion-has-a-shopping-mall-romance-system-and-you-even-get-to-fight-a-boyband">Warframe's 1999 expansion has a shopping mall, romance system</a>, and you even get to fight a boyband.</p>

            <p>
Heihachi Mishima, antagonist of the Tekken series, is set to make a return to the series in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8</a> this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Heihachi's reveal was announced at this year's Evo fighting game esports event in a new trailer, along with a new story mode chapter called The Dark Awakens.
</p>
<p>
He'll be the third DLC character added to the game since its release earlier this year, following Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska.

<p>

The Dark Awakens story mode will be free for all Tekken 8 players, focused on the ongoing feud between the Kazama and Mishima families.
</p>
<p>
Heihachi debuted in the very first Tekken game and has featured in every game in the series since. He's therefore deeply connected to the story of Tekken, so it's no surprise to see him return as a playable character in Tekken 8.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, his presence is already felt in the story mode due to his connections to certain characters, where he appears in multiple flashbacks.
</p>
<p>
Iconic capoeira fighter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eddy-gordo-joins-tekken-8-roster-today">Eddy Gordo was added to Tekken 8 in April</a>, while Polish president <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-season-one-roadmap-includes-dlc-fighter-the-polish-prime-minister">Lidia Sobieska joins later this week along with a photo mode</a>.


</p>
<p>
Also announced at Evo was the location of the 2024 Tekken World Tour Finals, which will take place in Tokyo in December.
</p>
<p>
Tekken 8 received extremely positive reviews when it launched in January. "Tekken 8 is a marked improvement over Tekken 7 and a perfectly executed balancing act, keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer Tekken 8 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Kicking off a brand new story arc in a brand new location, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</a> opens with you joining Wuk Lamat in her quest to complete the Rite of Succession, a grand quest to decide the next to ascend to the throne of Tuliyollal as Dawnservant. It’s an adventure of great discovery for players, as you’ll follow the various exploits and successes of the current Dawnservant, Gulool Ja Ja, journey across the continent of Tural and learn about its many peoples, while also striving to discover the legendary golden city.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRYcglRzdB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What Dawntrail focuses on is putting the Warrior of Light (that’s you, by the way) into a mentor role, allowing other characters in the story to become the focal point of the narrative. It doesn’t mean that you are pushed aside, as everyone you meet clocks you immediately as someone to not mess with, but you often work to help others reach their potential as others like Louisoix, Minfillia, or Hauchefant (sorry fanbase) did for you.</p>


<p>The result is that new characters like Wuk Lamat, Koana and others from Tural are really given the space to breathe in this story that rightfully belongs to them. Not only this, but characters that have deserved further development are explored further over the course of the story, such as Erenville and Krile.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that everything is breezy and chilled for the whole time, of course, with Dawntrail having all the classic Final Fantasy trappings of twists, betrayals, and suddenly raising stakes to keep you on your toes. The story introduces certain elements that hark back to previous Final Fantasy games which are handled wonderfully in Dawntrail, but that might be due to my sheer bias towards the specific game that it draws from. Also, the implications that are laid out for the future of the story of FFXIV are both interesting and successfully build upon what we already know in a satisfying fashion.</p>


<p>Dawntrail doesn’t fix what isn’t broken, so the fundamental gameplay of this decade old MMORPG is much the same. You run around the world fighting things, talking to NPCs and occasionally finding yourself instances either alone or with a team to support you. There hasn’t been a brand-new field mechanic introduced this time around, but Dawntrail makes great use of elements and ideas that were introduced with previous expansions &nbsp;–&nbsp;even the ‘following without being noticed’ one, which I did not enjoy previously.</p>
<p>One thing that has been a topic of debate amongst the fans of the game is with the Dungeons and Trials, which are noticeably more challenging than previous expansions. The bosses themselves hit damn hard, the mobs are relentless at times, and the mechanics of the fights are combined in some interesting and often brain-stretching ways that require some thinking and repeat runs to overcome. They’re not impossible by any means, but tough to parse out on occasion.</p>

<p>Personally, I have loved this increase in difficulty as it has been fun to overcome each challenge the game has thrown at me, and – as a White Mage player – it is always nice to feel needed. Also, by the time you’re pushing past level 90 and have followed countless instances, players should be capable of tackling these challenges. That said, I’m a savage/extreme player; I’m used to far worse than this, so this increased difficulty could push away less ardent players.</p>
<p>Speaking of combat, there are a couple new Jobs, and these complement the others well. Viper, the twin-blade wielding swashbuckler, is your new melee DPS. This Job is great fun and, once you get past the slightly confusing tool tips for the abilities, flows together in a satisfying flurry of slashes. I’m yet to experience the higher levels of this Job, so cannot call myself an expert by any means, but what I have played makes it easy to recommend to those that like being up close and personal.</p>

<p>For those like me that enjoy being a bit further away from the action, the other new Job is Pictomancer – think Bob Ross, but even more magical. This magical ranged DPS uses paint to create weapons, monsters and spells to attack in combat and might just be the most fun I have had with a Job in years. It does take a while to click, as the amount of set-up required to effectively use the abilities is larger than most other Jobs, but once you get it, the rotation of the abilities is just so damn satisfying and colourful.</p>
<p>The changes to existing Jobs, which have changed again since launch with this week’s 7.01 patch, have been a mixed bag as they always are. My precious White Mage thankfully hasn’t changed much, aside from receiving a new little dash, but other Jobs have received dramatic reworks. Some of these reworks have allow for smoother transitions for their fans, while others have basically been completely changed. The Astrologian is one such Job, which I had only just learned how to play again in Endwalker and will now have to start learning all over again!</p>

<p>If changes to your favourite Job have you gnashing your teeth in annoyance, at least you can sink into the undeniable beauty of this game. Every area in Dawntrail is brimming with bright blues, greens and golds, and full of sweeping vistas to gawp at. In fact, I have taken more screenshots while playing Dawntrail than I ever remember in another game, let alone previous expansion of this one. This is bolstered by the graphical update that came with the 7.0 update for Final Fantasy XIV that has greatly improved the lighting effects, many of the textures, and a lot of the character models.</p>
<p>The improved characters models are especially noticeable as Dawntrail has an almost excessive number of close ups on characters. This has happened previously, of course, but pretty much every cutscene in Dawntrail has a “Look how pretty these characters are. <em>Look at it!</em>” moment, and they’re right – the characters look fantastic now. Oh, and of course the most important part of FFXIV, the glamours, has been really given a boost by this update too with some gorgeous new gear to obtain.</p>
<p>Then there’s the music. Oh boy, the music. I mentioned this previously in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-in-progress/">review in progress</a>, but Soken is emptying his bag of musical tricks with this expansion. From the incredible jazz background music of Tuliyollal to the lo-fi beats of Solution Nine, every track of this game is infused with the same vibrant life of the core narrative and visual style of the expansion. The field battle theme is one of the best in the entire game, the boss theme is stellar, and the final boss theme – just wow. I’m now eagerly awaiting the release of the Dawntrail OST</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Late last week, 241 developers from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-elder-scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a> developers Bethesda Game Studios announced a "wall-to-wall" union under the Communication Workers of America (CWA). Alongside Bethesda Montreal’s <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639">unionisation last month</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">union of Zenimax QA workers</a> last year, this marks a historic moment in the US game industry labour movement.</p>

<p>"We, a majority of developers at Bethesda Game Studios Dallas, Rockville, and Austin, are ecstatic to announce the formation of our union with [the CWA]," the union <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_USA/status/1814417799902601409">announced on X</a>. "As a democratic organization, we seek to empower the collective wishes of our studios' workers; having a safe, sustainable, and equitable work environment for all.  Having a proper seat at the discussion table allows us to turn those wishes into reality."</p>
<p>The union has been recognised by Microsoft, though no contract has yet been finalised. "We’re thrilled to get down to brass tacks and win a fair contract," said CWA member Mandi Parker in <a href="https://code-cwa.org/stories/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">a statement</a> on the organisation’s website. "Our unity is a source of real power to positively shape our working conditions, our lives, and the company as a whole."</p>
<p>The Bethesda Game Studios staffers join others who have successfully formed unions with the CWA, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-of-america-staff-have-ratified-a-union-contract-the-first-to-do-so-at-a-major-us-studio">Sega of America</a> and Activision Blizzard. Earlier this year, the CWA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-qa-supplier-lionbridge-accused-of-retaliatory-layoffs-in-union-busting-move">filed Unfair Labor Practice charges</a> against Activision QA supplier Lionbridge Technologies after they allegedly fired the entirety of a 160-person team in retaliation for union-related activities.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the CODE-CWA <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1696518155336593704">announced</a> that there were more than 4,000 tech, game, and digital worker members in the CWA. It’s heartening to see that number growing, given months and months of firing, closures, and 'quiet layoffs' - in which companies effectively <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">terminate vulnerable employees</a> with return-to-office mandates.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered several studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> makers Tango Gameworks and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a> studio Arkane Austin.</p>

            <p>Steve Sinclair, CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> studio Digital Extremes, reckons publishers should give live service games more time to find their footing, and not see dodgy release periods as a "make or break" indicator of a game’s success. "It comes out, doesn’t work and they throw it away," Sinclair told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/big-publishers-eject-too-soon-from-live-service-titles-says-warframe-boss/">VGC</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Isn’t that a shame when you put so many years of your life into iterating on those systems or building technology or building the start of a community", said Sinclair, "and because the operating costs are high, you get terrified when you see the numbers drop and you leave."</p>

<p>"We’ve seen this with amazing releases that I  think have massive potential, and I think they eject too soon," he continued. "[Publishers] think the release is make or break, and it’s not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it. It comes out, doesn’t work and they throw it away."</p>
<p>We’ve seen several high-profile live services shutter support in recent years, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/knockout-city">Knockout City</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babylons-fall">Babylon’s Fall</a> - the latter of which lasted less than a year.</p>

<p>Natus Vincere has claimed the top spot at the Esports World Cup, dominating G2 in a reverse sweep for the ages and landing the $400,000 grand prize – and 1000 Club Championship Points. It was an epic tournament from start to finish, and during the playoffs, NAVI propelled ever onwards, wiping out FaZe Clan, MOUZ, and finally, G2 Esports to win the first CS2 tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-win">Historic Win</h2>



<p>Natus Vincere is by no means a stranger to Counter-Strike victories. It’s one of the winningest organisations in the space and has claimed countless trophies, but this one is extra special as it’s the first Counter-Strike 2 tournament to take place at the inaugural Esports World Cup. Now, Natus Vincere’s name will be forever carved in the history books – and on the grand plinth in Riyadh that marks the victors at this monumental event.</p>



<p>In the closing rounds of the tournament, Natus Vincere almost walked effortlessly to the win with a 13 – 6 victory on Inferno. In almost every round, Natus Vincere’s Valerij ‘b1t’ Vakhovsjkyj proved to be far too dominating a force for G2 to handle, earning the Ukrainian player his first MVP award and a high rating from HLTV.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled in Riyadh, players can look forward to the next big Counter-Strike 2 event – IEM Cologne 2024, which boasts a $1 million prize pool. After that, we’ve got the ESL Pro League S20, the BLAST Premier: Fall Final, the Thunderpick World Championship, the BLAST: World Final, <strong>and then </strong>the Perfect World Shanghai Major.</p>



<p>It’s a good year to be a CS2 fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-marketing-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-put-more-money-into-marketing-star-wars-outlaws-than-any-other-game.933345/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-marketing-ubisoft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO revealed that the firm has put more money and effort into marketing Star Wars Outlaws than any other Ubisoft game ever released. He also stressed that the company expects a strong launch based on the ‘positive community sentiment’ circulating the project.</p>



<p>However, a recent gameplay video that surfaced online drew negative feedback based on how ‘unpolished’ the game looks – and it’s hitting the market in just one month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marketing-success-apparently">Marketing = Success, Apparently</h2>



<p>During the <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/atyzrozr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a>, Yves Guillemot, the long-time CEO of Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we are factoring in is a strong launch for Star Wars Outlaws. That’s the fact that it’s among the most awaited games of the industry this year and reflecting a really strong positive community sentiment, and also the fact that we are coming with the biggest marketing campaign ever so far for a Ubisoft game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would be interesting to see the numbers, as some Ubisoft titles, such as 2014’s Watch Dogs, had masterful marketing campaigns that included extensive trailers, CGI and live-action representations, billboards, ad spots, and more. Some estimates put the marketing budgets for Assassin’s Creed titles in the hundreds of millions of dollars. By comparison, I don’t feel as though Star Wars Outlaws has enjoyed that prolific a marketing campaign.</p>



<p>Ubisoft thinks the next few months will be monumental for the business. This is mostly because of the impending releases of both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but also because of the ongoing energy around live service titles like Rainbow Six Siege and XDefiant, which has exceeded expectations since being released in May 2024.</p>

            <p>The below list of new PC games was communicated to me using smoke signals by two brave Advance News Scouts, shortly before the Maw's event horizon expanded by 100 metres. I have not heard from them since. I fear their souls are even now pigmenting the tides of Destiny 2 gifs that fill the Maw's lower intestines. Sergeant Shagbert, Corporal Pieface, I will avenge you in the only way I know how: by posting some words on a website.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 22nd July sees the early access launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a>, in which you build castles (disclosure: Brendy did some writing for this one), together with Game Boyish action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513580/Veritus/">Veritus</a>, in which you storm them. On Tuesday 23rd July, there's pet sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weyrdlets">Weyrdlets</a>, which Matt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/virtual-pet-sim-weyrdlets-is-like-animal-crossing-on-your-desktop-except-you-might-get-some-real-life-work-done-too">described</a> as "a neat mix of much-needed wholesome distraction and actual real-life utility", <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conscript">Conscript</a>, which Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conscript-review">summarised</a> as "sturdily crafted and gruelling WW1 survival horror", and dystopian circuit puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2312770/Linkito/">Linkito</a>, which Zachtronics diehards might like. On Wednesday 24th July, a choice of two ways to move: tonguing cliffsides in the ribbiting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valley-peaks">Valley Peaks</a>, or oozing morosely around your apartment in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exhausted-man">Exhausted Man</a>.

<p>As for Friday 26th July, our lost Scouts were silent. It's possible that there will be new games on Friday, but to actually name some would be to disgrace the memory of two valiant journalists - two wonderful, noble, made-up men. If you have no respect for the dead, or you're just sick of this framing gag, by all means list a few games in the comments thread. Myself, I'm so distraught that I'm taking the whole week off (this part isn't a joke - I've got Non-RPS Business to attend to.) Hope you have fun!</p>

<p>Heihachi Mishima, the old dude who everyone thought was dead (because Harada told us he was) is making a grand and shocking return to Tekken as the third DLC fighter for Tekken 8. This announcement took place on the stage at EVO 2024 in Las Vegas, with Katsuhiro Harada retconning himself and revealing that Heihachi <strong>didn’t </strong>die at the end of Tekken 7 when he, you know, was<em> thrown into a volcano.</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heihachi-returns">Heihachi Returns</h2>



<p>In an impressive Tekken 8 trailer, fans are treated to the revelation that Heihachi Mishima is returning to the game as a DLC character:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="TEKKEN 8 - Heihachi Mishima Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Despite being tossed into a volcano by his son at the end of Tekken 7, Heihachi is back and looking perfectly healthy. His hair and moustache aren’t even singed by the roaring fires of the red-hot volcano, which is impressive. At this point, Heihachi is just plain stubborn – he’s a pensioner and he refuses to die, taking all forms of punishment with reckless abandon and coming back for more every time.</p>



<p>It’s expected that he’ll arrive as a DLC fighter in Tekken 8 in October or November if the current release schedule is anything to go by. Players are waiting for Lidia to be unlocked at present, and earlier this year, Eddy surfaced as the game’s first DLC fighter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-valorant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will arrive on Game Pass later this week on July 24, a known Spanish leaker has claimed.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already said</a> that Modern Warfare 3 would be coming to Game Pass later this month, and we now have another leaker claiming that the shooter will be added to Microsoft's subscription service this month. On X, usually-well-informed Spanish leaker 'extas1s' (who often writes for Exputer), has <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815163683661594741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that he can now "100%" confirm that Modern Warfare 3 will be added to Game Pass (both PC and Xbox, but no cloud) later this week on July 24.</p>
<p>In the post on X, the Spanish leaker also said that Valorant will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this week on July 26, following an initial brief beta period on consoles. The 5v5 character-based tactical FPS launched on PC in 2020, and (beta) <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for consoles was added last month</a>.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was released for PC and consoles in 2023. The shooter is the third installment in the rebooted Modern Warfare (sub)series. Here's what we wrote about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023-that-familiar-feeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year.</p>
<p><em>"Call of Duty Modern Warfare III builds off of last year’s strengths and weaknesses without having enough identity to stand up on its own", </em>we wrote<em>. "So much of this year’s content is recycled in ways the series hadn’t seen before. If you skipped Modern Warfare II and care not for the campaign, the breadth of multiplayer modes can keep players engaged for the next twelve months. It’s tough for Infinity Ward to shake off the comments that this year’s Call of Duty is merely a $60 expansion pack. Even for a fan of the series that has hit prestige year after year, the content this time around is a tough sell. The multiplayer modes and ability to “Carry Forward” unlocks into Modern Warfare III gives players both a fresh start while not forcing them to start from scratch as in previous years. Modern Warfare III might not be one of Call of Duty’s strongest entries, but the multiplayer offerings still remain the biggest draw going forward."</em></p>

<p>Hours ago, one of the most monumental grand final matches in the history of Call of Duty esports unfolded in Texas. On a stunning stage, the New York Subliners and OpTic Texas (on home turf) collided after a weekend of competition that saw both teams battle ferociously for their shot at the title.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled, a 5 – 1 scoreline saw OpTic secure the trophy – the organisation’s first Call of Duty world championship since 2017. This match was a contender for the most electrifying fixture we’ve ever seen in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas are your new Call of Duty League champions after eradicating the reigning champs, the New York Subliners, in an intense best-of-nine. Every step of the way, OpTic Texas was dominant, maintaining control in almost every round and refusing to relent against a capable Subliners squad. </p>



<p>It was a relatively balanced fixture in the opening Hardpoint and the first round of Search and Destroy, with the first two rounds going the way of OpTic before the Subliners picked up a clean win in Control on Karachi. That’s when OpTic Texas entered a flow state, winning the second Hardpoint by a 120-point margin and walking all over the Subliners in the second Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>On home turf, the crowd was volcanic, and the presence of the OpTic leadership team alongside the iconic dynasty of Crimsix, Scump, Karma, and FormaL meant that the Green Wall was alive and enthralled during this event. It couldn’t have worked out better for OpTic Texas if it had been scripted.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Special commendations should be handed down to every member of the OpTic Texas squad. For Dashy, it’s his first ring after seven appearances at Champs. Kenny (with his headband) is a two-time world champion now and maintained a flawless aura throughout this fixture. Shotzzy, who became MVP of the event, deserves endless praise for netting another ring. Finally, Pred, who played out his rookie season in 2022, needs recognition for his unparalleled energy this year.</p>



<p>It was a phenomenal event from start to finish, but it marks the end of our CDL 2024 season. Now, we look to the Esports World Cup for what comes next.</p>

Unlike the Steam Deck which runs Linux, Asus went with standard Windows for its operating system, which in theory allows for more games to run natively as well as the option to more easily run a variety of PC gaming storefronts. Now, in 2024, the Ally X provides a much-needed hardware refresh that improves the form factor and functionality of the device. And this time, Asus assures us the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ally X won’t be frying SD cards</a></span> (more on that later).</p><p>The Ally X, notably, is not a full blown “sequel” to 2023’s Ally. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">At $799</a></span>, it doesn’t upgrade the processor from the first, higher tier model. The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, however, is more than capable of powering a vast majority of modern games, from tiny indie titles that won’t ever trouble it, to more substantial graphical powerhouses like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Ally X, however, did add more (and faster) memory, with 24GB of ram and it has a very, <em>very</em> generous 80Wh battery that made me almost never think about battery life during my time with it. And it does have the same 7-inch, 1080p, 16:9 LCD screen that, while obviously not as flashy as an OLED panel, never fails to look splendid (that is, when my fingerprints weren’t all over its glossy surface).</p><p>While I have issues with Windows as an operating system for handheld gaming, the Ally X has made it hard for me to go back to my Steam Deck. That said, I still find Valve’s portable PC to be a better gaming experience overall. But oof, it’s gettin’ close ya’ll. </p><h2 id="h394637"><a id=""></a>My experience with the Ally X</h2><p>I’ll spit numbers and stats at you in a moment, and I’ll more thoroughly address my complaints where they exist. But there’s no mistaking it: The Ally X provided me with a wonderful portable gaming experience, and it’s likely to continue doing so. It is a substantial improvement to the experience of the original Ally and is compact enough to make it worth putting up with Windows.</p><p>As a New Yorker, I decided to really lean into the Ally X’s portable potential as much as possible. While that motivation was a little cut short by the fact that the Ally X doesn’t include a case (forcing me to use the inner shell of my Steam Deck OLED case in which it…mostly fit), its smaller size compared to the Steam Deck was welcome as I traveled on trains and buses daily. </p><p>Once I got past some frustrations with Windows 11, I rarely thought about hardware and software, I just gamed. My time was largely spent with <em>Flintlock</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> (which I had to be home for due to a required internet connection), and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. All ran with virtually zero flaws at a decent 40-60 frames per second depending on how I fiddled with the graphics settings. The screen has a 120HZ refresh rate too, so you can push to even higher framerates with the right game.<br></p><p>And because I was playing games on my Steam account, I could come home and pick up right where I left off on my much more powerful home computer. Like the Steam Deck, the Ally X flattens the boundary between PC gaming at home and on the go, but with wonderful battery life and a form factor that is more like pulling my Switch out of my bag than it is the mini battle tanks other portable gaming PCs tend to be.</p><p>The Ally X provides a fantastic PC gaming experience on the go for a price that’s a touch steep, but fair if you’re up for investing in a great portable experience. </p><p>That said, the choice of operating system here, which technically is not Asus’ fault, can make for some rough setup and more than a few frustrating quirks.</p><h2 id="h394638"><a id=""></a>Windows %@*&amp;ing sucks for this kind of gaming experience</h2><p>My first hour or so with the Ally X was spent, well, setting up Windows. I had to sign into my Microsoft account, turn down all the offers for a free trial of OneDrive, Microsoft 365, and other stuff that isn’t a concern to me whatsoever on a gaming machine. Then, for some reason, it wouldn’t recognize my pin to sign into the device. So I had to reset that a number of times. </p><figure id="" data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given that you shouldn’t leave a portable Windows machine just open for anyone to pick up and sign into your personal account, having a pin to unlock the device is necessary. And because Windows doesn’t recognize controller input on its lock screen, I had to use the touch screen as I attempted and reset my pin two or three times. </p><p>By the end of going through Windows setup and constantly entering my pin, I was exhausted and left with a device with fingerprint smudges on it because I can’t use the controller buttons to sign in. </p><p>And it didn’t end there. Windows would constantly do its weird Windows things. While playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, I’d get spontaneously taken back to the desktop with no way to get the game back on the screen easily. Remember, there’s no keyboard, so I can’t Alt + Tab to it. I’d swipe up constantly to make the Windows taskbar appear to keep pressing the game’s icon to no luck. That, of course, left more fingerprint smudges on the device. </p><figure id="" data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Just navigating Windows will result in more smudges than anyone ideally wants.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Suspending the device to toss it back in my bag while moving between trains was also unpredictable. I’d hit the power button to see it go black and then suddenly pop to life again on the Windows lock screen. Why? I don’t know. Sure, there are ways to tailor Windows to play nicer with this kind of form factor, but the operating system is an unideal solution for portable gaming. It pales in comparison to SteamOS on the Steam Deck and doesn’t even come close to the seamless experience of using something like a Nintendo Switch. I would gladly take a gaming-specific operating system that might technically run fewer games (though the Proton compatibility layer for Linux OS is making Windows less and less essential these days) over an operating system that is just foundationally not meant for this kind of form factor.</p><p>There’d be other issues, like troubleshooting randomly disconnecting Bluetooth with a pair of Pixel Buds Pro that never has issues on other devices. Random Windows prompts here and there were another pain point, as was any time I seemingly activated Co-Pilot for reasons unbeknownst to me. </p><p>While Windows has gotten better with recognizing a gamepad as an input device, it’s still best practice to set up your Ally X with a keyboard and mouse connected. I loved the hardware of the Ally X, but companies like Asus desperately need to start exploring alternatives, or Microsoft needs to relent and offer some kind of more lightweight version of its OS for these kinds of gaming devices.</p><figure id="" data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>I spent most of a morning’s train ride trying to troubleshoot this nonsense.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Something’s gotta give because this is not a great solution. </p><p>But once I got gaming, and Windows left me alone, <em>damn</em>,<em> </em>the Ally X rocks. </p><h2 id="h394639"><a id=""></a>The Ally X just <em>feels </em>right</h2><p>Upon first holding the device, the Ally X is immediately more comfortable than its predecessor and everything just feels more premium this time around. The shell has been tweaked a bit so it’s a touch larger than the original Ally, but its grips are less angular so it just rests in your hands more naturally. To be honest, I still find the Steam Deck to be more comfortable even if it is a larger device compared to the Ally X.</p><figure id="" data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The triggers and bumpers have been reshaped and feel better. The same is true of the four face buttons, which, though still flat and less colorful as I’d like them to be, feel better to press than the original device. The thumbsticks, in particular, are excellent, with more resistance than the previous ones. The d-pad also got some love and feels more reliable and less slippy than the glossy one on the original. The dual rear buttons are also less prominent than the original Ally, which on that device I had found to be too prone to accidental presses.</p><div><h4> I almost never thought about battery life  </h4><p> The Ally X ships with a 65W charger that gets  the Ally X up to a full charge quickly (it’s compatible with a 100W  charger if you want even faster charge times). I don’t remember how many  times I charged this device, but it wasn’t an everyday requirement.  You’ll get less battery life if you switch the device to its more  powerful performance setting in Asus’ utility software, but even while  playing modern games, battery life was beyond generous.  </p></div><p>The Ally X is a touch heavier than the original Ally, but in my opinion, this helps it feel a little more “premium” in the weird way that extra weight sometimes does. </p><p>All of these form factor changes mean that if you’re considering an upgrade from the first Ally, you’re gonna have to go shopping for a new case and/or skin since it won’t be compatible with existing accessories for the first Ally. </p><figure id="" data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, the choice to go with a slick matte black isn’t just aesthetically pleasing, it helped me focus a bit more on the game. While I like a colorful object as much as anyone else, the black case makes it easier for your eyes to focus on the screen more so than the bright white of the original Ally’s case. </p><div><h4> What exactly did Asus upgrade?  </h4><p> Though it sports the same processor and 120HZ  screen of the original Z1 Extreme Ally, the Ally X comes with twice the  battery capacity, an additional 8 GB of RAM (which runs at a faster  speed than the original), more cooling vents and improved fans to push  heat out of the device. It also ships with 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage.  Check out the one-to-one breakdown of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both model’s specs on Asus’ blog</a></span>.  </p></div><p>Perhaps the best addition, however, is an extra USB-C port that can both charge the device and connect to peripherals or any USB4 compatible device. With the Ally X, Asus has made the case that these kinds of machines need two USB ports. You won’t need an external hub, for example, to charge the device while connecting it to a screen or other device. With two ports, the Ally X just feels more portable and less dependent on carrying around a bag full of extra stuff to sprout more connections into the device.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ally X is an excellent, premium-feeling portable PC gaming experience with fantastic battery life, a very pretty, color-rich screen, and increased utility with its additional USB C port. </p><h2 id="h394640"><a id=""></a>The most minor of hardware complaints</h2><p>I love the Ally X, as you might’ve noticed. But there were a few things I think could’ve been better (aside from Windows sucking the fun out of the room).</p><p>While the screen looks great, it is a fingerprint magnet. Given how much you need to use the touch screen to operate Windows to use the machine, that means a single session of gaming will see this thing smudged up pretty quickly. I found that I had to carry around a microfiber cloth to consistently wipe away the marks. The Ally X also repositioned its right thumbstick to be closer to the screen. This would often lead me to accidentally touch the screen with my right thumb. Not only would that leave more fingerprints, it would sometimes trigger something in-game as many games recognize a touch screen as a mouse click.</p><p>I also would’ve liked to have seen a 16:10 1920x1200 screen instead of the cinematic, more desktop standard 16:9 1920x1080 size. With 16:10, you get a taller image which pairs nicely with a smaller device. Such a ratio is standard on the Steam Deck and Switch for a reason. The 16:9 letterbox shape just feels a little too tight for me. That said, some older games don’t support that resolution, so the extra real estate isn’t always getting used. Still, it would’ve been a nice inclusion. </p><p>Also, for 800 bucks, the Ally X should ship with a case. </p><h2 id="h394641"><a id=""></a>Asus’ past Ally troubles</h2><p>An impressive machine in its own right, the first Ally certainly impressed with a pretty LCD screen, a slim form factor, and some satisfyingly powerful compute power to run games at 1080p, often at great framerates. But with great power comes great heat, and that heat turned out to be a problem for the 2023 Ally model as it would be known to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fry SD cards</a></span>. </p><p>To make matters worse, Asus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t exactly swift to own up to this problem</a></span>.

And, to be honest, that’s something to take into consideration when we’re talking about throwing down $800 on the new Ally X. </p><p>Speaking to <em>Kotaku</em>, an Asus representative stated that the SD card issue has “long been identified” and that the team “took all precautions possible to avoid users encountering similar issues with the Ally X.” Time will tell how true that is. Asus also said that it will be offering a standard, one-year warranty with the Ally X, as it doesn’t anticipate the new device running into the same issue that caused them to extend the warranty on the original Ally to two years.</p><h2 id="h394642"><a id=""></a>The ROG Ally X is a fantastic hardware refresh</h2><p>The Ally X is easily the best version of the Ally.

I hesitate to say it’s worth an upgrade if you have already invested in the Ally Z1 Extreme from last year, but if you’ve been interested in portable PC gaming and <em>need</em> Windows, the Ally X is more than up to the job.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It made sense at the time as he met his end during Tekken 7's story, but he's been such a mainstay that fans wanted him back in some form.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We had the chance to speak to Tekken's Katsuhiro Harada and Kohei Ikeda about Heihachi's return, and they shared the thought process about bringing him back from the dead.</p><p>"Tekken 7 really focused on the story arc between Heihachi and his son, Kazuya, and so, we really wanted to show that kind of final conclusion, and he seemed to die at that point," Harada said. "But then, after that happened, Tekken 8 was released, and we put a lot of effort into the story and the fans really seemed to be engaged with that. And as that was happening, we were kind of feeling that the players kind of missed him as well. Obviously, we did, too. So, it was kind of decided later on that we would do that."</p><p>Despite that, preperations were being made in the background to set the stage for Heihachi's return.</p><p>"We did kind of make the preparations for Heihachi," Ikeda said. "<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-character-reveal-is-reina-perhaps-the-spiritual-successor-to-heihachi">Reina was one due to that link that she has to Heihachi.</a> And then, if you look closely at the 30th anniversary logo, you can see that it's comprised of Devil's wings. There are two different styles, but if you take a step back and look at, it actually looks like the silhouette of Heihachi's face. Right? So, we were doing some of the preparations in the background."</p><p>While they weren't ready to share many more details on Heihachi, there did have a few teases to share. </p><p>"Like you imagine, it is a bit too early to be talking many details about his character, but to give some hints, he has a very powerful play style throughout the series, so we tried to recreate that in Tekken 8," Ikeda said. "So, the focus is on that. But also, if you saw the story hints about the monks in the footage and what he has to do with them, that will maybe dictate some of his move set as well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Heihachi is the third DLC character for Tekken 8 and follows Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska. While his arrival is exciting, there is plenty more for fans to look forward to, including the first ever story DLC in the Tekken franchise. This new chapter of 'The Dark Awakens' will continue the clash between the Kazama and Mishima families and will be available as a free update for all players in the future. </p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

                <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Heihachi_Mishima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a> as the next DLC character for Tekken 8 and revealed that, for the first time in the series' history, a new chapter in the story mode will be added to the game. The extra story content will delve deeper into the ongoing feud between the Mishima and Kazama families.</p><p>The announcement was made during Evo 2024, at which Tekken 8 was a major attraction for players wanting to compete in high-level battles and viewers who want to see the best of the best duke it out in the fighting game. Heihachi is a fan-favorite character and one of the main antagonists of the Tekken series. His arrival follows <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Eddy_Gordo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, a DLC character that is already available, and <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Lidia_Sobieska" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who will be available widely from July 25. Heihachi is expected to be available in Fall 2024.</p><p>The story expansion, which builds on the ongoing 'The Dark Awakens' storyline, will be free, but publisher Bandai Namco has not yet confirmed when it will be available.</p><p>The other notable Tekken-related announcement is a collaboration with Nike, which includes in-game gear and the Nike Air Foamposite One Kazuya Mishima sneakers. A trailer that debuted during the Tekken finals at Evo 2024 showcased a variety of the game's characters sporting Nike sneakers and the iconic branding integrated into the stages.</p><p>The shoes, meanwhile, got a surprise drop and were available to purchase to Evo attendees via the SNKRS app. Bandai Namco indicated it would provide further details on the Nike x Tekken collaboration in the future.</p><p>Evo 2024 in Las Vegas officially became the largest in its history, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evo-2024-is-officially-the-largest-esports-competition-ever/1100-6524526/" data-ref-id="1100-6524526">largest competitive tournament in esports history</a>. Over 10,224 players across 63 countries signed up for at least one of Evo's eight big tournaments and, alongside Tekken 8, Street Fighter 6, Mortal Kombat 1, Guilty Gear Strive, and King of Fighters XV were a few other big draws. The throwback game for 2024 was Street Fighter III: Third Strike. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-reputation-system-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher 3 PC players unite as modder 'Freak' has released an interesting new mod that restores the reputation concept in The Witcher 3.</p>
<p>Developer CD Projekt Red cut the reputation concept from the game when it was released back in 2015, but this new mod aims to restore that feature. When using the mod, player choices and behavior correspond to reputation points in different regions. The mod includes five reputation levels, including hated, disliked, neutral, liked, and respected. Each level corresponds to Geralt's reputation points range in the region. According to the modder, the different reputation levels will influence the corresponding region's economy. In addition, all bedding&nbsp;and bargaining activities are also affected.</p>
<p>What's cool here is that the outcome of certain quests based on Geralt's choices will affect Geralt's reputation in the region, gaining or losing. We've included an overview of the different reputation influences below:</p>
<p><em><strong>Hated</strong>: +30% buying price, -70% selling price, -20% bargain multiplier, -50% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Disliked</strong>: +15% buying price, -15% selling price, -10% bargain multiplier, -25% bet&nbsp;multiplier</em><br>
<em><strong>Neutral</strong>: same with vanilla</em><br>
