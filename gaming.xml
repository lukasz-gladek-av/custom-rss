			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">Red Dead Redemption</a> mods released online in the past few days offer various visual improvements, new gameplay features, and better historical accuracy for guns.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Everything mod</a>, which doesn't yet upscale every texture in the game as the name would suggest but brings significant improvements to a variety of objects, such as wanted posters, blood splats, bullet holes, the moon, and John Marston himself. The mod creator also confirmed that every other texture yet to be upscaled eventually will, but it will require some time.</p>

<p>The second of these new Red Dead Redemption mods is one that gun buffs and those looking to make the game a more historically accurate experience should consider. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/461?tab=description">The Guns of the Old West Historical Overhaul mod</a> renames in-game weapons to reflect their real-life counterparts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/06-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>The third and final new Red Dead Redemption is the only one that introduces a new gameplay feature - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/451?tab=description">a first-person view mode</a> for increased immersion. As the game was never intended to be played in first person, there are some clipping issues, such as when riding a horse, but outside these issues, the game should be fully playable with a modded camera view. The modder also recommends using the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ClipTweaks - FPS-DOF-FOV mod</a> for a higher field of view if needed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is finally available on PC, 14 years after its original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is also available on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and is fully playable on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S via backward compatibility.</p>

            <p>
A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> battle royale spin-off has reportedly been cancelled, after Chinese gaming giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> pulled funding.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sniper-elites-battle-royale-game-has-been-canceled-as-tencent-pulls-funding/">Insider Gaming</a>, which states that Project Archipelago: Sniper Battle Royale was recently scrapped following public playtests over the summer. 
</p>
<p>
That report claims Tencent got cold feet on the project after seeing the high-profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">flop of PlayStation's recent live-service bid Concord</a>.

<p>
Sniper Elite developer Rebellion declined to comment on the report. Eurogamer has contacted it and Tencent for more.
</p>
<p>
British developer Rebellion announced "pre-alpha access" to Project Archipelago via a three-day playtest back in mid-August this year, though has been quiet on the game since. 
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the project showed squads of snipers picking off enemies from afar, in rusted, near-future environments that featured a mix of weathered contemporary buildings but also sci-fi-looking airships.
</p>
<p>
It's understood that there have been no job losses as a result of the cancellation, with developers moved over to the next main Sniper Elite game, Sniper Elite: Resistance, which is due to launch on 28th January 2025.
</p>
<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki said this month of Concord's launch and sudden removal from sale</a>. "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC," said Zynga's executive vice president of games Yaron Leyvan.

			<p>Silent Hill 2 continues to be not where it should be on a system like the PlayStation 5 Pro, and the improvements introduced in the latest patch released last week are not enough to significantly improve the game on the mid-generation console.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at how the game's aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-patch-1-06-playstation-5-pro/">1.06 patch</a> improves the game on PlayStation 5 Pro over the previous update, which introduced PSSR support that led to more issues than benefits in terms of visual quality. For the new patch, in Performance Mode, developer Bloober Team actually went back to TSR for Performance Mode, and the benefits are evident, as global illumination and reflections are more stable and less noisy, and there's no more massive disocclusion when moving the camera as in the previous version of the game. However, in general, image quality is not so different from the base model, and the slightly better performance may be due to the different cost of TSR over PSSR and not due to any actual improvement.</p>
<p>One thing that is very surprising in the latest version of Silent Hill 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro is that the game looks better in Performance Mode than in Quality Mode, as the latter still uses PSSR, which isn't a very good fit at the time for the types of visuals the game pushes. Performance is a little more stable than on the base model, but in terms of image quality, it still leaves a lot to be desired, requiring more work to actually get to the point where it should be on a system like the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 PS5 Pro Patched: Are The Image Quality Problems Fixed? It's Complicated..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giugvMWCclY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technical issues aside, Silent Hill 2 is a more than worthy game to get not only for fans of the series but for any survival horror fan, as Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking what is widely considered one of the best entries in the Konami series. You can learn more about the game in Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>

            <p>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror">r/twosentencehorror</a> will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-struggles-backlash-positive-reviews/">told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"If you take Paranormal Activity, it cost pennies and it made millions," Kciuk continued. TheGamer follow up in their article with The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blair-witch">Blair Witch</a> Project, Get Out, and Terrifier 3 as examples of low budget horror films that made a lot more than they cost. Get Out, for example, was the highest grossing debut based on an original screenplay in history as of 2017, raking in over $250 million worldwide on a budget $4.5 million.</p>
<p>"This is one of the genres in both film and games where you actually can take very little resources, and the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage," Kciuk went on, citing the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>. "It's a very small game, and it was done in like a month or two, and it earned millions of dollars. Horror tends to have those breakout hits from very small teams, or even solo developers."</p>
<p>I imagine that Kciuk doesn’t actually find spreadsheeting to be “the interesting part” about making horror. More, as she alludes to, the freedom to make some very effective work with limited resources. The proliferation of PSX-style horror speaks to her assertion that "the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage". I’m reminded, fittingly, of how the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> turned short draw distances into an aesthetic with that game’s iconic fog. There’s some great examples of horror cinema turning restrictions into innovation, too, like Sam Raimi’s shaky cam and travelling shots in The Evil Dead 2.</p><p>Still, this is also might be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on how few truly big-budget horror games actually gets made. Outside of Capcom’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> series, and the occasional outlier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-sales-figures-2-1-million">like Alien Isolation</a>, the fact that horror appears cost-effective might just be the result of small budget horror making up most of what’s available. There are also big games that suggest the opposite, like the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> - one of my personal favourites from recent years that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">still struggling to recoup development costs</a>.</p>

<p>New data reveals that Game of the Year nominee Balatro has generated approximately $4.4 million on its mobile version.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/royal-kingdom-records-450k-in-first-four-days-to-beat-royal-matchs-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketPair</a>, which obtained the data via <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, revealed the new data. According to the data, Balatro generated $1 million in its first week, and following a spending surge last week, that number quickly rose to $4.4 million.</p>



<p>It is unclear why the surge in purchases increased, but the game was nominated for several awards last week, which almost certainly attributed to its rise in popularity. The game received several awards at different events, including five at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards 2024</a>, including Game of the Year and Best Mobile Game.</p>



<p>Balatro was first released on February 20, 2024, and saw huge success on launch, generating $1 million in its first eight hours of release. It sold 250,000 units in its first three days and 500,000 copies in its first ten days. In August 2024, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-2-million-units-sold-major-gameplay-update-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that the game had sold two million copies</a>. The game received universal acclaim according to review aggregator Metacritic.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Balatro announced its first major crossover with some of the most popular games, including The Witcher 3, Among Us, Vampire Surivors, and Dave the Diver. </p>

            <p>
Mac Walters, the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades, has announced a "pause" in operations at his new AAA game studio, Worlds Untold. 
</p>
<p>
Its team had been developing a near-future action adventure game set "in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", backed by investment cash from Chinese game giant NetEase.
</p>
<p>
Last night, however, Walters announced that the studio was now seeking "a new partner to help bring our vision to life", with staff members now looking for work elsewhere in the meantime. 
</p>
<p>
"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold," Walters wrote in a post on Worlds Untold's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">LinkedIn</a> page.
</p>
<p>
"While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-mac-walters-leaves-bioware-after-19-years">Walters confirmed his departure from BioWare in January 2023</a>, after 19 years working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> and then Mass Effect as a lead writer for the franchise.
</p>
<p>
Worlds Untold also hosts Dragon Age alum Elizabeth Lehtonen as the studio's head of production, and concept artist Ramil Sunga as its head of art.
</p>
<p>
"As someone who's been at the heart of building out new IPs in the past, I recognise the challenges, but also the opportunities with creating worlds from the ground up," Walters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-mass-effect-lead-writer-says-new-narrative-focused-studio-will-avoid-painting-ourselves-in-a-corner">told Eurogamer last year</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement at the time, NetEase said it hoped Worlds Untold would build franchises "with depth and possibility that can't be contained in a single game, or even a single medium".
</p>
<p>
Walters has discussed his tenure working on Mass Effect at length with Eurogamer on several occasions - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">in-depth interview with our Bertie on dreaming up plans for an entire trilogy of games</a>, and with myself on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plotting-a-course-how-mass-effect-3-brought-the-trilogy-to-a-close">how BioWare wrestled its trilogy of storylines and characters to a close</a>.

            <p>Balatro, the indie roguelike inspired by poker, has generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone since its release in September.</p>
<p>That's according to data from AppMagic (thanks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/">PocketGamer.biz</a>), which reveals the mobile game made a million dollars in its first week across the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>Balatro was first released in February on PC and console, but its popularity has surged following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-out-on-mobile-later-this-month">release on mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>What's particularly interesting is its release as a premium game for an upfront £9.99, unlike so many free-to-play (with microtransactions) games on mobile.</p>
<p>Balatro is also part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>, meaning even more players have played the game through Apple's subscription, though it's unclear how much money its inclusion here has generated.</p>
<p>On launch day, Balatro made $162k and then peaked at $200k a week after launch on 29th September, resulting in that million dollar first week.</p>
<p>Since then sales have declined but its inclusion as a Game of the Year nominee (among others) at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a> has caused a resurgence in sales in the last couple of weeks. This resulted in the game's second highest earning week to date, generating $727k.</p>
<p>Developer Localthunk confirmed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fkp6m0/balatro_mobile_and_iap/">reddit</a> ahead of Balatro's mobile release it would not have microtransactions or "predatory monetisation".</p>
<p>The developer also spoke out, back in March, about the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama"> game's rating drama</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". Said Localthunk: "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The free-to-play third-person shooter game Star Wars: Hunters will debut soon <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842320/STAR_WARS_Hunters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, as announced yesterday by publisher Zynga (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-interactive-completes-merger-with-farmville-publisher-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a couple of years ago by Take-Two). Star Wars: Hunters debuted last June on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by British studio NaturalMotion, the game focuses on fast-paced 4v4 battles featuring a varied roster of characters to choose from: Ewok Grenadier Pilbush, Zabrak Archer Nox, Imperial Heavy Gunner Sentinel, Wookiee Juggernaught Grozz, Dark Side Assassin Rieve, Rodian Sawbones Skora, Mandalorian Vanguard Aran Tal, Twin Shield Droid K-AOS, Jedi Droid J-3DI, Jawa Scavenger Utooni, Unrelenting Bounty Hunter Imara Vex, Miraluka Sharpshooter Diago, Rebel War Hero Zaina, Mon Calamari Prodigy Sprocket, Droideka Speedster Slingshot, and Trandoshan Trapper Charr. Each character comes with their own weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Hunters currently features four modes: Squad Brawl, Dynamic Control, Power Control, and Trophy Chase. It was also supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/huttball-from-swtor-will-be-available-in-star-wars-hunters-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Star Wars: The Old Republic's unique Huttball mode, but it seems it was removed before the launch.</p>
<p>While the official PC launch is scheduled for January 27, interested players can sign up right now on the Steam page for the upcoming playtests, which will take place between December 13 and 16 and again between January 10 and 13. The best news, though, is that Star Wars: Hunters will feature full cross-play and cross-progression between all the available platforms. As such, you will be able to carry over your existing progress, provided you connect your Zinga ID account.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Hunters™ | PC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qubow1v9zFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main perk of the PC version will be enhanced graphics compared to the mobile platforms. Even so, the system requirements are very low, as you can see below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD FX-8320</em><br>
<em>Memory: 4 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 730 or AMD Radeon R7 240</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 4570 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon R9 270</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Recommended 4K:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p>The current plan is to launch Star Wars: Hunters out of early access at some point in the middle of 2025.</p>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, released in 1993, followed the first ToeJam &amp; Earl game from 1991, continuing the adventures of its whacky alien protagonists. However, it's a straightforward side-scrolling platformer where the previous game was inspired by Rogue.</p>
<p>Vectorman, meanwhile, was released in 1995 and was notable for its pre-rendered 3D models, rivalling those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> on the SNES.</p>
<p>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs, meanwhile, is an earlier game from the platform: a top-down shooter adapted by Sega from the Capcom arcade game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/shuhei-yoshida-is-leaving-playstation-after-31-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Shuhei Yoshida has announced that he is leaving PlayStation in January 2025, bringing an end to a 31 year stint at the company that has gone hand-in-hand with the 30 years of PlayStation itself.</p>
<p>Making the announcement in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/">an interview on the PS Blog</a> and PlayStation Podcast, Yoshida-san said:</p>


<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.</p>
<p>“So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p>
<p>One of the first members of the PlayStation project at Sony in February 1993, Yoshida-san is best known for his stint as&nbsp;President of PlayStation Studios from 2008 to 2019 (then known as SIE Worldwide Studios). In that time he was the steward to the PlayStation 3’s continued revival through the second half of the generation, helped to being indie gaming to PlayStation in a major way through the PlayStation Store, and was one of PlayStation’s main figureheads around the time of the PlayStation 4 launch, affectionately known as Shu throughout the PlayStation fanbase.</p>

<p>He even featured in one of the single defining moments of the run up to the PS4 and Xbox One launch, featuring in a video alongside Adam Boyes as the company dunked on Microsoft’s unpopular planned changes to physical game ownership and digital rights at that time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWSIFh8ICaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since stepping down from head of PlayStation Studios in 2019, Yoshida-san has had the role of Head of Indies Initiative at PlayStation. This has largely taken him out of the spotlight, though indie games have been on of his biggest passions over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>“One time stood out for me in my memory as something really, really special was when Journey got the Game of the Year Award,” he explained. “Journey was distributed through PlayStation Network. It was a digital-only, small game. You can finish playing the game within like three hours.</p>
<p>“But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life.</p>
<p>“The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p>
<p>We wish him all the best with whatever he has planned next.</p>

            <p>The next round of cards joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have leaked ahead of December's events.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">datamines revealed multiple cards and events arriving in December</a> with gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions as the focus.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a new update of the app, promo cards for the next Wonder Pick and Solo Battle events have leaked. And yes, Bulbasaur is included.</p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h01lva/new_app_update_confirms_new_promo_cards_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>, the following Pokémon will feature and all have new card artwork: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.</p>
<p>The latter two are particularly important as they reportedly will be the focus of the forthcoming Wonder Pick event. That Onix artwork looks a little interesting though.</p>
<p>These cards will all feature in a Venusaur PvE event set to begin on 29th November and run until 13th December. Much like the Lapras Ex event, players will battle against AI in solo battles for the rewards.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has already proven incredibly popular since its launch last month - in its first three weeks it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">spend your pack points</a>: these are earned by opening booster packs and can be spent on specific cards, but they have an unknown expiry date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the span of a few hours, two promising projects from former Mass Effect developers were abruptly halted. Both were sci-fi titles that fans hoped could be reminiscent of BioWare's acclaimed RPG saga.</p>
<p>The first one, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two days ago, was Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin studio, which had to be shut down due to a sudden lack of funding. A few hours ago, Mac Walters announced similar news (though not as dire) for his Worlds Untold studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Mac Walters, a writer on Mass Effect 3 and game director on Andromeda and the Legendary Edition compilation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Worlds Untold last year with funding from NetEase. That's the problem: they have split with NetEase and are now seeking another partner. In the meantime, work on the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life. This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together. </em><em>In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I’m deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we’ve had together at Worlds Untold. While we’re pausing for now, this isn’t goodbye—there’s more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>We interviewed former Mass Effect writer and director Mac Walters last year as part of the news announcement, and we learned that the project would be more of an action/adventure title rather than an RPG, more story-driven and linear.</p>
<p><em>I've done RPGs and I love them, but I wanted to do something that led with story. It's an action RPG but with a lot of story and as much as we were always able to blend that into the RPG choose-your-own-adventure style, I really like the idea of telling something that's perhaps a little bit more linear. It looks at choice and consequence and things like that but in a different light.</em></p>
<p><em>I was also looking at some of the games that I had enjoyed recently, whether it was The Last of Us, Uncharted, or Tomb Raider that I get kind of get swept away in. I really wanted to focus on building a game that allowed me to tell a great adventure story.</em></p>
<p>We wish Walters and all the Worlds Untold team members involved the very best.</p>

            <p>I just played the neon bathroom graffiti on magic mushrooms stylings of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games"> puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a> for the first time last night, and it is very much my thing. It’s glowy! It’s violent! It’s thinky! You can <em>be</em> a <em>bullet, </em>and <em>then</em> you can be <em>another bullet</em>! Mental! (It’s technically the same bullet, but still!)</p>
<p>The basic idea is you take out stages of dudes, but you lose if you ever shoot without killing something. You move to where your bullet lands, so you have to plan routes through all the enemies, making sure one target is in view of the next. Also, you can steer the bullets if you want. Sometimes you can snipe a bird and feel the soaring freedom of a top down-view. Sometimes you snipe a fish and feel like a bastard. It’s great.</p>
<p>It’s also currently 40% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">on Steam</a>, alongside a new horde mode update. Trailer below, and details below-erer.</p>

<p>“Take on entire platoons of THE CULT’s brainwashed minions, but watch out for a new enemy that can fire back,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1309950/view/4481739601737681384">the update</a>. “The sniper cultist has a bullet with your name on it, and will put a premature end to your quest for vengeance if you don’t find a way to deal with them”. I am literally just learning about this now. I’m only about eight levels in. Enemies that can fire back sound silly, in a good way.</p><p>“If you’re wondering how THE GIRL can take on an entire horde of cultists with only one bullet, well, now she can reload: by shooting herself,” it continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during their financial report for Q3 2024, CD Projekt RED announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now surpassed 30 million units sold, while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, has sold 8 million in around a year.</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CDPR, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In less than four years since release, we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year, it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year, the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips.</em></p>
<p>Despite the controversial launch that featured many bugs and issues, especially on consoles, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of all time, following up on what was arguably the best game of the previous generation - The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. As such, even with all those caveats, it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest digital launch ever</a>, with an estimated 10.2 million units by January 2021. Sales probably slowed down for a while after that due to word of mouth and the fact that Sony outright removed the game from its PlayStation Store for several months.</p>
<p>However, CD Projekt RED's constant updates completely turned around the reception, culminating in the release of Update 2.0 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. All this work paid off, allowing what was already a rough diamond to properly shine. The sales are only the obvious consequence.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Cyberpunk 2077 that performed well for the Polish studio, as The Witcher 3 continues to sell even nine years after its launch. Overall, total revenue amounted to $55.7 million, while the company registered a consolidated net profit of $19 million.</p>
<p>The other big news of the day was, as already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the announcement that The Witcher 4 (codenamed Project Polaris) is officially in full-scale production. On this, Nowakowski said:</p>
<p><em>I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its own North American-based team</a>, so work on that game continues separately. However, it's clear that most of CDPR's attention will be on the upcoming The Witcher game for the next few years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kai-cenat-beats-twitch-sub-record-%E2%80%93-but-he-had-to-hang-someone-along-the-way.1046229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kai Cenat has beaten his subscriber world record, racking up more than 580,000 concurrent Twitch subscribers during his Mafiathon 2 superstream. He has easily stormed past all previously set records, and since November 2, his channel has been live 24 hours a day. There’s no sign of the subathon slowing down.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the superstar streamer found himself in hot water following a bit on his broadcast that saw him and his friends ‘hang’ someone, prompting Kai to be concerned about getting banned from Twitch for what was later revealed to be a planned prank.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-kai-hang-someone">Did Kai Hang Someone?</h2>



<p>On social media, clips of the event are being circulated like wildfire, showing a topless man hanging from a high bar on Kai Cenat’s stream. A rope is pulled and the man, whose hands are bound, hangs for a few seconds, kicking his legs, until he’s brought down from the noose.</p>



<p>He’s then tended to by a medical team.</p>



<p>At first blush, Kai and his team seemed to be shocked and perplexed about the event. They’d strolled out into Kai’s garden not knowing what to expect, then they found a man willing to be hoisted <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2311951387?t=4h29m49s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">up in a noose live on stream</a> – for clout and content, of course.</p>



<p>As a preface, it was revealed that the man being hung was Max Major, a YouTube ‘magician’ with a professional penchant for tricks like this. Later on, Kai shared a video, in which Major explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don’t know is that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight, but the choices that you made since the day that we met. </em></p>



<p><em>Since the first time we met, you pushed me, you challenged me, and you wanted to see me fail. And I thought tonight, I’ll give you exactly what you asked for.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>By that point, Kai had already beaten his Twitch subscriber record, but the stunt was able to push him even further and put him in a high-ranking position on various social media platforms as a trending topic.</p>

That said, Advent Children's highly detailed CGI quality was lauded upon release, and even today, it stands as a testament to Square Enix's powerful tech--especially this 4K Blu-ray edition.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$11.89 (was $31)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has a notorious reputation as a failure that cost Square Enix (at the time Squaresoft) millions of dollars and eventually led to Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi leaving the company, it's still worth checking out for die-hard Final Fantasy fans--especially when the 4K edition is on sale for this low--click the coupon box on the listing to get the full discount.</p><p>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within looks and sounds unlike most other Final Fantasy properties, especially of the era, taking place on Earth in the distant future, and featuring a hard sci-fi plot with only the most tenuous ties to the rest of the franchise. Nevertheless, it deals with similar ideas as Sakaguchi's other work--namely the exploration of Gaia theory and ideas like life forces connecting living things--and it features surprisingly gorgeous CGI for the time.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$13 (was $16)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV fleshes out the story of Final Fantasy XV, giving fans a look at events that were not shown in-game.

While he was executive producer on early games like C<em>rash Bandicoot: Warped</em> and <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em>, he later moved into leadership role across the business group, eventually becoming president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide studios. </p><p>He told the PlayStation podcast that <em>Journey</em>’s release in 2012 on PS3 as a download-only indie hit that went on to win Game of the Year was a career highlight. “But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life,” Yoshida said. “The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p><p>The executive was also well know for his own development experience and design sense.

He eventually stepped down from being the head of Worldwide studios in 2019, at which point then-Guerrilla Games studio head Hermen Hulst stepped into the role amid a reshuffling of PlayStation leadership. Hulst is now co-CEO of PlayStation alongside Hideaki Nishino.</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement marks the second major departure from PlayStation in under a year, after previous Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan retired last spring. It will also leave the console maker without one of its most high-profile execs and visible faces in the community, with a long track record of popularity among fans. He’s perhaps best known for his part <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the infamous 22-second E3 2013 clip</a></span> demonstrating how games are shared on the PS4, a stunt that kicked off Sony’s current high-end console dominance. </p><p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement comes on the eve of PlayStation’s 30th anniversary on December 3. In addition to the release of a retro line of PS5 consoles and accessories to celebrate, fans are also wondering if Sony might be teasing additional reveals or even a mini-showcase before the year is out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like its predecessor, with the entirety of planet Earth available to explore, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has a whole lot to do. 2020’s Microsoft Flight Simulator was the first (and, so far, only) 10 I've given in a review, and the enormity of the options available in this year’s follow-up have only been tempered by the lingering problems that accompany them. Because codes weren’t available early and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-steam-reviews-collapse-to-overwhelmingly-negative-dev-admits-it-completely-underestimated-excitement-for-the-game">unexpected turbulence</a> at takeoff made it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flight-sim-2024-players-getting-stuck-in-hours-long-loading-screens-xbox-says-its-working-on-the-issue">literally impossible to play</a> for the first 24 hours, I’m still working on my up and coming aviation career, as well as this review. For now, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 has some extraordinary features to set it apart, but its impact is also falling short of how blown away I was by the last edition, and I really wanted to be blown away. Instead, I'm "merely" impressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right off the rip, the biggest new addition to Flight Simulator 2024 is its career mode. You pick a starting airport as your home base, get hired by a fictional aviation company, and begin progressing through your career as a pilot. It all plays out like a traditional video game skill tree: after you master the beginner missions, you open up new options, and completing them opens up further opportunities still. So you can get a tail wheel endorsement, for example, after you complete the requirements for a commercial pilots license, which then opens up options for newer planes and jobs like search and rescue, or you can get certified in rotor craft (helicopters) which leads to stuff like operating a sky crane. Which, to me personally, elicits a "hell yeah." Each new certification or endorsement also opens up different jobs you can pick from, ranging from simple stuff like flightseeing, to more complex operations like, well, anything to do with the helicopters, basically.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Real-World Locations</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eventually you earn enough money and reputation to throw off the bonds of your employment and start your own aviation company. I haven't gotten that far yet, but I am moving along with my fixed wing endorsements at a pretty good pace. To what end, I haven't yet decided, but I'm looking forward to opening my own company and taking the lion's share of the profits. Those profits are used to further grow your business, and I can’t wait until I can afford my own fleet of aircraft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first few missions in career mode are just basic flight training, meant to familiarize you with the ins and outs of flying a plane. What I found disappointing is that the flight training is pretty much identical to the tutorials from 2020. All the training missions take place at the same airfield in Sedona, Arizona as 2020 and the actual tasks are exactly the same. The only real difference is that the AI-generated instruction and on-screen advice is a little more clear about what's expected of you in any given mission. I do appreciate the default tooltips in 2024 because there are about a million different buttons that do a million different things, and I used to have to go to Google whenever I'd forget how to release my parking brake. (I don't even think I'll end up turning them off like I did in 2020, just because I'm a forgetful fellow.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The further you get in career mode, the more mission types open up.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After the initial training missions, you do a few flights to get enough hours in to test for your commercial pilot's license. Taking the tests costs in-game currency, but you only need to pay for it once and you can retake it as many times as you need. You also need to have enough experience and do well enough in the training missions – but if you are already an experienced pilot, you can just jump right into the test and skip the lessons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The further along you get, the more missions and mission types open up. What I thought was a little strange, however, was that they don't all open up near your home airport. I picked a small airfield in the deepest parts of eastern Maine, KMVM Machias Valley Airfield, but after my initial missions, I was being sent to Europe to complete aircraft delivery and skydive missions. It's not something that bothers me too much, but it did come across as odd, which pulled me out of the “career” illusion I had built up for myself. Lousy imagination!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, I'm actually really loving career mode. In 2020’s iteration, I would make-up little missions for myself, like delivering pizza by air from Knox County Regional Airport in Owl's Head, Maine to the remote Matinicus Island 20 miles off the coast (a real thing that happens, by the way). Having structured reasons to better familiarize myself with the aircraft and patterns in the sky is going to keep me on course, so to speak, and stealthily make me into a better sim-pilot. So far it's my favorite part of Flight Simulator 2024 and I'm looking forward to starting either my own airline or a helicopter sky crane company. Or both! I've got time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition is the challenge league. This mode is the most game-y of them all, but retains all the simulation flight models and physics I love. There are three challenges each week, as well as leaderboards, which I am a huge fan of because I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the three available in the first round, my favorite is the F/A-18 rally race through the Grand Canyon. You fly Maverick's modern jet of choice through a section of the canyon, slaloming gates in a hunt for pure speed. Since it's still the same flight model under the hood, that’s not as easy as it seems – but holy crap is it fun as hell. It took me a lot of tries to get to my final score of around 1 minute 54 seconds, and that's not even a <em>good </em>score: it only put me in the Bronze league. But the satisfaction of seeing my time raised up above the Xbox Live Gamertag of someone who I don't know at all, but is unknowingly my arch-nemesis, is great. I'm looking forward to revisiting the challenges each week. The previous Flight Simulator had landing challenges with leaderboards, too, but as fun as those were, they didn't quite hit the dynamism of flying a fighter jet through one of the world's seven natural wonders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Take Your Pic</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the things I liked the most about the last Flight Simulator was how it let me visit places I'd either never been before or would almost certainly never visit again. In Flight Simulator 2024, sightseeing has been placed front and center in the photo challenges mode. You visit famous landmarks and places around the world and take photos of them. The type and criteria of the photos changes with each landmark. For example, in the first photo challenge, you need to take a picture of the Great Sphinx while the sun is above its right shoulder on the equinox. Oh, and you need to do it on foot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's one of the biggest and coolest new features: you can land, get out of your plane, and walk around. However, it's not quite as elegant as I had hoped it would be. First of all, your walking speed is paced realistically, just like the rest of the simulator, (who would have guessed?) so if you've been playing first-person video games all your life, walking at an actual human's pace feels almost painfully slow. Secondly, the level of detail is going to depend on a whole bunch of different factors, like the power of your PC, the strength of your internet connection, and the health of the cloud servers, so your mileage can (and probably will) vary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in spite of some weirdly GoldenEye-esque objects around the Great Pyramid complex, the up-close terrain itself is really detailed. The sand and desert rocks look incredibly realistic, and the ground in general now seems to look more like how ground is actually supposed to look around the world. If you taxi through tall grass at the end of a rural runway, for example, the tracks from your wheels remain even when you return later. Same thing with snow or mud. Mud will even stick to your wheels and supposedly have an effect on your aerodynamics, although I can't speak to how true that is on account of never having flown an actual plane with mud-caked tires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also way more animals now. Instead of static points on a map telling you "there is a giraffe here," animals now pop up in the places you'd expect them to be. I very much felt like I was actually at an airfield in Maine when a bull moose plodded its way across the airstrip as I held short of the active runway. I haven't seen any other animals myself, but I know they're there because Flight Simulator 2024 uses an open-source database of animal locations to put them where they're supposed to be – so with some luck, I can go to Africa and see some lions before long.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Graphical Improvements</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And when you lift your head up from the ground, Flight Simulator 2024 can look much better than its predecessor across the board (with an emphasis on <em>can</em>). The improvement is especially stark in a place like the Grand Canyon, which I visited many times in 2020’s Flight Simulator. Whereas before it looked very obviously like a smooth, texture-mapped computer model up close, now it looks amazingly like the real thing. I am currently running Flight Simulator 2024 on a pretty beastly PC: it has an i9-13900K processor, a Radeon RX 7900XT GPU, and 64GBs of DDR5 RAM (disclosure, the RAM was provided by Corsair). With that setup, this year’s Flight Simulator looks and runs way better. Mostly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem comes from the fact Flight Simulator 2024 is streamed from the cloud, and so far they haven't ironed out all the issues. In career mode, I did a flightseeing mission around Venice, Italy, and St. Mark's Basilica was a purple-checkered polygonal model with no textures whatsoever, while the rest of Venice was rendered in perfect detail. I honestly would rather have something like the world map packs of 2020’s Flight Simulator living on my SSD and only stream the boring parts. Right now, though, there's no way to do that, and the reliance on cloud streaming was something the Flight Simulator team really hammered on the importance of leading up to launch, so I'd be surprised if they switched to some kind of hybrid model at this point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in spite of everything looking really good on my beastly PC, it's worth noting that my GPU is running at 100% capacity at the recommended settings in order to make that happen. When I turned the graphics down to the next lower preset, it only brought GPU usage down to 98%. That ain't good. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Current Thoughts</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In spite of what can reasonably be described as a catastrophic launch, I'm already pretty much in love with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – I'm just not blown away like I was five years ago, when I first found myself faced with the opportunity to fly to literally any place on Earth. That option remains, of course, and it's been vastly improved by some smart new features, but it doesn't have that same impact, either. As we move away from the rocky launch, I'm encountering fewer and fewer issues, which gives me the chance to focus on what I love about Flight Simulator. Usually that’s flying around aimlessly, but this time career mode is also giving me real reasons to take off, as well as a better understanding of the world of commercial aviation. I'm going to keep at it before I render my final verdict, but right now, in spite of its initial problems, I think Flight Simulator 2024 is pretty damn great, even if it hasn’t caught the lightning in a bottle that was the last Flight Simulator once again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Yoshida has no plan for the future, but hopes to continue helping indie developers.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,923 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> head of indies Shuhei Yoshida will leave the company on January 15, 2025 after 31 years, he announced. <span id="more-930027"></span></p><p>“I’m leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment on January 15, 2025…,” Yoshida said in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Official PlayStation Podcast interview</a>. “It’s like announcing the launch date of a new game, [something] I haven’t done for a long time [laughs].”</p><p>He continued, “I’ve been with <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,499 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love [<a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>], I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida joined Sony Interactive Entertainment, then Sony Computer Entertainment, when it was still just a department under PlayStation creator Ken Kutaragi.</p><p>“Ken’s team was doing the development, and there was another team under <a title="Companies > Sony Music Entertainment Japan [246 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-music-entertainment-japan">Sony Music Entertainment Japan</a> making games for Super <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a>, and that was another small team preparing to make games for PlayStation,” Yoshida said. “So the two teams merged, Ken’s team under Sony and Sato-san’s team under Sony Music Entertainment Japan, to create Sony Computer Entertainment in November 1993. When the company was established as a joint venture, we held a party and everybody was in one room at the hotel [laughs]. I remember we had about 80 people total. We were very small.”</p><p>Yoshida’s job was to talk to publishers and developers in Japan, making phone calls and visits in hopes that they would make games for PlayStation. Yoshida eventually became president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, today known as PlayStation Studios, before stepping down to lead Sony Interactive Entertainment’s indie games initiative.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“When I was managing [PlayStation Studios] working with big studios, making AAA games was great,” Yoshida said. “However, when I went to events like E3 or Gamescom, I always went to the indie game area. And I found games that I liked, and oftentimes the developer was there showcasing it. So I’d take a photo with the developer, trying to help promote these games.”</p><p>As for what the future holds, Yoshida said while he has no plans yet, he <a href="https://twitter.com/yosp/status/1861562394251825531" rel="noopener" target="_blank">would like to stay in the industry</a>, helping independent game developers.</p><p>“I have a couple of events to visit. The Game Awards are in December. I have commitments to the Taipei Game Show in January and <a title="Companies > DICE [231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/dice">DICE</a> Summit in February, because I’m on the board… so that I’ll continue to do. But other than that, I have no plan. I enjoy my free time… I would like to continue to help indie developers or indie publishers if they need me. So I’ll probably continue to help these creative, talented indie teams in the future.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Black Ops 6 features classic CoD Zombies, marking a true return to form. The series has seen a litany of iconic Zombies maps down the years, but Tranzit is highly regarded, and much loved, and rumors abound the legendary locale could be ready for another round in BLOPS 6. </p>



<p>It’s been a joy to play both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> in Black Ops 6 Zombies. They each possess characteristics and sport trademarks of the great Zombies maps of yore. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a> on the way, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies fans are being spoiled.</p>



<p>With three Zombies maps already confirmed, the internet is already rife with speculation about a potential fourth. If gossip is to be believed, the fourth—or any subsequent maps—may turn back the pages of history and welcome back Tranzit to a new audience.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-tranzit-come-to-zombies-in-black-ops-6-dlc-rumors">Will Tranzit Come to Zombies in Black Ops 6? DLC rumors</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No time for food. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no confirmation of Tranzit returning in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and nothing has leaked via data mining at this moment.</strong></p>



<p>Anything you read about Tranzit returning in Black Ops 6 is pure speculation and conjecture. There is genuinely nothing to substantiate this rumor, but there is a reason why the Tranzit conversation continues to lurk around every undead corner.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-tranzit-rumored-for-black-ops-6">Why is Tranzit rumored for Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Tranzit rumor is based on the <strong>“Black Ops 6: ‘The Truth Lies’ – Live Action Reveal Trailer”</strong> launched on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty’s official YouTube channel</a> back on <strong>May 28</strong>.</p>



<p>Several references pertaining to Tranzit pop up during the 57-second trailer. You can see the footage in its entirety below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Ops 6: 'The Truth Lies' - Live Action Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V08UPqchVgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Interestingly, one of Call of Duty’s leading social media personalities, where Zombies is concerned—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrRoflWaffles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrRoflWaffles</a>—broke down why they think Tranzit is destined for a revisit in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>They found several familiar-looking objects and locations in the trailer, and went as far as to say a “<strong>Tranzit-inspired remake</strong>” could be on the cards, but stressed it’s only a “<strong>theory</strong>.”</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Again, this is all we have on the Tranzit rumors right now. Trust me, I want to see the map return just as badly as many of you reading this right now do. </p>



<p>If you’re a newer CoD player, Black Ops 2’s Tranzit has a special place for many due to its unique map design—featuring a moving bus taking you to several mini-locations all within the overall confines of the map. You could also customize and upgrade the bus mid-round, and it’s still one of the most original Zombies maps to date.</p>



<p>Keep checking back as you never, we may find official information confirming or shutting down the Tranzit rumor.</p>
