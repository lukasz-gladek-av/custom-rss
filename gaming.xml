            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans have all but given up waiting for the next Starfield expansion, which is <strong>long </strong>overdue for an announcement. In July, I conducted a deep dive into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-missing-expansion-bethesda-silence-unease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Starfield DLC</a>, which has been teased by Bethesda Game Studios for more than a year but has no firm indication of what it is or when it will be released.</p>



<p>It’s in danger of shattering Todd Howard’s promise of ‘one major expansion a year for Starfield’, the 2023 space RPG that set the world ablaze for all of about two weeks.</p>



<p>In a recent developer showcase, yet another reference to the Starfield expansion was dropped, <strong>but yet again</strong>, it was mentioned that no details can be shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-starfield-s-next-expansion">Where is Starfield’s Next Expansion?</h2>



<p>Shattered Space, the first Starfield expansion that ultimately failed to move mountains, was detailed <strong>before Starfield even came out in September 2023.</strong> We knew what it looked like months before it launched in September 2024.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, almost an entire year later, and <strong>we haven’t got a clue what the next expansion will be</strong>.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has had umpteen chances to reveal the next Starfield expansion, but has neglected to do so, which suggests issues with the DLC’s development.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?t=303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent developer spotlight</a> with Tim Lamb, who has been with Bethesda since 2006, broke down his career. In the closing seconds of the interview, Lamb addressed the future of Starfield:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As it comes to Starfield, I’m really excited for players to see what the team has been working on.</p>



<p>We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p>



<p><strong>I can’t go into all the details just yet</strong>, but I will say that part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2024, Todd Howard confirmed another expansion was in development, and in March 2025, the Bethesda team said that ‘exciting things’ are planned for this year that they can’t talk about. We’re now approaching September 2025, and <strong>we still have absolutely nothing to go on</strong> where Starfield is concerned.</p>



<p>Are you tired of waiting for the next Starfield expansion? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76’s ‘premium subscription’, Fallout 1st, is set to give players another huge advantage over ‘non-paying’ users of the post-apocalyptic MMO platform. In recent years, many key perks of the plan have popped up, with Bethesda Game Studios stumping up plenty of reasons why Fallout fans should part ways with some monthly cash to secure Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the latest change to Fallout 1st, a ‘Doctor Bag Aid Box’ has popped up on the PTS (Public Test Server) in Fallout 76. This feature will enable Fallout 1st subscribers to store an unlimited number of chems in their C.A.M.P.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-chem-storage-in-fallout-76-courtesy-of-fallout-1st">Unlimited Chem Storage in Fallout 76, Courtesy of Fallout 1st</h2>



<p>When I was a non-stop fan of Fallout 76, I’d endlessly preach the benefits of Fallout 1st. For a few dollars a month, you can secure a stack of Atoms, boosters, custom server access, exclusive outfits and items, survival tents, and <strong>much more</strong>. It seems silly to have a Fallout 76 account that’s <strong>not </strong>paired with Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>The latest addition might be enough to sway more players over to the realms of Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the PTS, players have noticed the arrival of the Doctor Bag Aid Box, an item that has been talked about for a few weeks. In Fallout 76, the Doctor Bag Aid Box is a deployable item in your C.A.M.P. that allows you to store an unlimited number of chems, such as Stimpaks.</p>



<p>Given how Stimpaks, Super Stimpaks, Psycho, Jet, Buffout, and other chems have a fair weight requirement in Fallout 76, this is a boon for players building their character/s around using them. No longer will they take up precious stash allowances, and soon, they’ll have a dedicated space in your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p>This mimics the addition of the ammo storage unit that was thrown into Fallout 76 several months ago, and it, of course, aligns with the scrap box that Fallout 1st subscribers have been using for years.</p>



<p>Would unlimited chem storage in Fallout 76 sway you into purchasing Fallout 1st? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests Valve’s next-generation Steam Deck could still be several years away. In a post on gaming forum NeoGAF, known hardware enthusiast and reliable hardware leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> claimed that the <strong>Steam Deck 2 is currently planned for 2028</strong>. </p>



<p>The comment, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-launch-october-16.1687405/page-5#post-270737598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made in a discussion</a> about competing handheld PCs, offered no additional details or evidence to support the date.</p>



<p>A 2028 release date somewhat lines up with past claims of the device being “quite a while” away from happening. Valve has previously indicated that it does not plan to release a new version of the Steam Deck until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-still-says-steam-deck-2-isnt-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant improvement</a> in performance and efficiency is possible. When introducing the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, Valve designer Lawrence Yang described the device as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/valve-steam-deck-old-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “definitive first-generation Deck”.</a> At the same time, he was said they were confident that in two or three years, there will be better technology to justify a successor to the first Steam Deck. Whether that</p>



<p>In January 2025, rumors picked up of a Steam Deck 2 utilizing AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor. However, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly shot down</a> by Valve engineer <strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais</strong> who said that <strong>“there is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For now, Valve continues to support the Steam Deck and its OLED revision, while competition in the handheld PC market intensifies from manufacturers such as ASUS and Lenovo.</p>



<p>The company has not announced any official release window for a Steam Deck 2. Even with the past reliability of the source, until anything is made official, take the claim with a grain of salt, especially when 2028 is still over two years away.</p>



<p>What do you think the Valve Steam Deck 2 will finally release? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>Wake up to the sounds of Kirby</p>

<p>In case you somehow missed it, Nintendo has an alarm clock that it occasionally updates with new (and free) themes.</p>
<p>In an announcement on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/f78d6765-cbb2-450a-b974-61ecbd756989">official Japanese website</a>, there'll be new sounds based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> added to Nintendo Alarmo in a future update, including seven different alarm types.</p>
<p>Here's a rough translation, which also notes how some alarms based on the new DLC will be added. When this information is shared locally, we'll provide an update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be seven new alarms , including songs from "Starry World." Please wait for further announcements regarding the release date of the alarms."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this announcement lines up with the release of the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land today, along with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Star-Crossed World</a> content, which is also available to existing owners as an upgrade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Alarmo also received free themes based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> and Super Mario. This latest Kirby-themed update follows the news of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event and an update to the Forgotten Land soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app.</p>

Players can unlock Gold Koopa Troopa and themed stamp sheets for Bowser's Minions and the mainline story mode. Koopa Troopa is compatible with several other Mario games for 3DS. And yes, in case you were wondering, Wario is bad at drawing Koopa Troopa, too.</p><p>On Switch, Koopa Troopa functions similarly to Goomba in Smash Bros. Ultimate, Bowser's Fury, Bayonetta 2, and Super Mario Party. You'll unlock the Koopa Troopa Spirit in Smash Bros., but since a shiny Koopa sticker doesn't exist in Super Mario Party, it unlocks the Goomba sticker (if you don't already have it).</p><p>Koopa Troopa also unlocks exclusive costumes in two additional games: Conga Master Party and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Two+Super+Mario+Series+Amiibo+Return+To+Amazon+7+Years+After+Selling+Out&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+19%3A22%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+19%3A22%3A48&amp;fnarticle_id=6534324&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYoshi-s-Crafted-World-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-Edition%2F449117242%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwhere-to-buy-super-mario-series-amiibo-koopa-troopa-goomba-amazon-restock%2F1100-6534324%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Crafted World</a>.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Goombas and Koopa Troopas have been franchise fixtures since the original Super Mario Bros. debuted in 1985 on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>In World 1-1, the first few obstacles Mario encounters are the ever-grumpy mushrooms with feet. After flattening a handful of Goombas by jumping on their heads, Mario meets the perpetually smiling tortoise for the first time. There's only one Koopa in World 1-1, but that's enough to introduce players to the more efficient method for eliminating Goombas. Over the past 40 years, Super Mario fans have hurled countless Koopa Shells at groups of Goombas.</p><p>Nintendo has iterated on Bowser's original henchmen on many occasions, but you can still count on seeing regular Koopas and Goombas in the vast majority of Super Mario Bros platformers and spin-offs. When you encounter one, there's a good chance the other is nearby, so it's only fitting that Amazon has both of these Amiibo in stock at the same time.</p><hr><h2><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F5HYD1FD,B0F5HYKP6J,B0F5HXWKP6,B0F5HZ6KL9,B0F5HYSVS1,B0F5HZ11D8,B0F5HWX7XC,B0FDM8FQSJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo at Amazon</a></strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558220" data-ratio="0.48181818181818" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558220"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png"></figure><p>Amazon has seven of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F5HYD1FD,B0F5HYKP6J,B0F5HXWKP6,B0F5HZ6KL9,B0F5HYSVS1,B0F5HZ11D8,B0F5HWX7XC,B0FDM8FQSJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eight Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo figures</a> in stock, and four characters are on sale for $20 each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Storied development studio Crystal Dynamics, famous for their work on everything from <em>Tomb Raider </em>to <em>Marvel's Avengers </em>to <em>Gex</em>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier today that as a "result of evolving business conditions", they had "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues".</p><p>Those conditions are numerous; there's an overall downturn in the video game market, particularly at the AAA end that Crystal Dynamics operate, in which it feels like more projects are being cancelled and studios closed then games are being released to buy and play.</p><p>But then there are problems cruelly unique to Crystal Dynamics, a studio with an exceptional track record who have nevertheless over the years found themselves bought by a large publisher (Square Enix) that had absolutely no idea what to do with them,<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> before more recently being offloaded to a company (Embracer) with even <em>less</em> idea</a>, and which has in no small part contributed to the dire state of the AAA market I mentioned above.</p><p>The company's full statement reads:</p><blockquote><div><p>Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly.

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4853f9b8731ad/final-fantasy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following some reports about the performance and visual presentation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2, Square Enix has now officially confirmed the title's frame rate.</p>
<p>Switch 2 users can expect this upcoming release to run at a "stable 30 frames per second" while also offering "smooth performance" as well as some slick visuals. Here's the company's <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">official update about this via its social channels</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Square Enix:</strong> "Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we don't have official specs detailing other aspects of the Switch 2 release just yet, Digital Foundry's John Linneman <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">recently gave this version high praise</a>, calling it the "best-looking thing" he's seen on the Switch 2 so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>I'm gonna say right now, this is the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2. Seeing that game running at a stable 30fps, with that excellent motion blur especially, it looked fantastic. It was completely stable, it looked on par – actually I would say it looks better than the PS4 version, at a glance.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Life video producer Felix Sanchez went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands on with this title at Gamescom</a>, so if you want to find out more about how the Switch 2 version holds up, check out our previous story.

            <title><![CDATA[Screamer Hands-On Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/screamer-hands-on-preview.1282551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like all-you-can-eat Pizza Huts, reasonably-priced concert tickets, and The Secret World of Alex Mack, Screamer is something I enjoyed in the 1990s but essentially disappeared from our lives decades ago. The original Screamer, released in 1995, was one of a trio of games developed by Italian studio Graffiti before it quickly rebranded itself as Milestone a year later. An over-the-top arcade racing game exclusively for PC, it arrived rapidly in the slipstream of pioneering 3D racers like The Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, and Destruction Derby (and was followed by a sequel and two one-and-done spin-offs) but has faded into relative obscurity since. However, over a quarter of a century since Milestone’s final Screamer game, the series is howling back to the track with a wild new look and an interestingly nuanced suite of controls and power-ups that shake up the slamming, the shifting, and even the steering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Federico Cardini, Screamer is a game Milestone has long wanted to resurrect, but you should know that it’s more the <em>name </em>that’s being brought back here. That is, aside from the title there really isn’t anything immediately significant in the new Screamer that meaningfully reminds me of the original. Dramatic changes of identity are usually kryptonite for sequels and reboots – especially belated ones – but I actually don’t think it’s a problem in Screamer’s case. The original was an impressive game for its time, but it was admittedly otherwise largely typical of arcade racing games in that era. The new one is a bit of a different story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games. A good deal of arcade racers generally allow you to count the number of pertinent instructions on your nipples. That is, there are only two: accelerate and steer. After an hour of hands-on driving and drifting with Screamer it’s clear there’s a lot more to it than this, and it’s this depth that makes it quite fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer is a twin-stick racing game, and it instantly reminds me of 2020’s Inertial Drift in this sense. While the left stick is used for conventional steering, the right stick is used to add drift angle. In simple terms, the left stick controls the front of the car, and the right stick basically controls the rear. It’s easier to grasp than it perhaps sounds, but it does require a certain deftness on both sticks to make the necessary adjustments to your angle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It goes much further than this, however, as Screamer also packs a potent range of power-ups that are extracted from two separate gauges that fill based on certain actions. Inspired by fighting games, Screamer calls this its ‘Echo’ system – where using one side of the gauge affects the other side. There’s a shotgun spray of bespoke, in-game terminology that you’ll encounter if and when you play Screamer yourself, but I’m going to avoid most of that here because I think it’ll only serve to make Screamer sound a little impenetrable. On track – and in the thick of it – it’s all fairly intuitive, so I’ll try to describe it as such.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screamer - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, the left side of the gauge will fill throughout a race both passively and via certain actions – like perfectly-timed shifts. Screamer’s vehicles have semi-automatic transmissions, so they’ll shift automatically if you’re overwhelmed (or you forget), but if you nail your upshifts you’ll fill the left gauge faster. It’s not a remotely racing related comparison, but it reminded me of Gears of War’s active reload system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The left gauge is used to provide both boosts and shields against attacking opponents. Even boosts are handled differently, with a press–hold-and-release mechanic that you need to time by using an onscreen icon. Get the release spot-on and you will earn a longer and more effective boost than standard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the gauge on the right? Well, you fill the gauge on the right by <em>using </em>the power-ups afforded by the gauge on the left. The gauge on the right allows you to use the offensive abilities Screamer has dubbed ‘strike’ and ‘overdrive.’ ‘Strike’ is a temporary boost in speed during which any other car you smash into will explode, and ‘Overdrive’ is an indefinite boost that lasts until you crash. Overdrive is pretty tough to use on the twistiest portions of the tracks; after a certain amount of time locked in Overdrive you’ll reach a critical state where even a brush off a wall will see you blow up. It is extremely quick, though, and it’s a power-up I observed the AI was always willing to deploy at every opportunity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the 1995 original, Screamer features a roster of unlicensed cars. However, while the original game’s cars were clearly just de-badged versions of iconic ’90s sports cars and exotics with otherwise generic names, the cars in the upcoming Screamer are wild, anime-inspired vehicles covered in aggressive, time attack-style aero. The anime inspiration extends beyond the cars, too; indeed, Milestone has partnered with Japanese animation studio Polygon Pictures for Screamer’s story. We weren’t privy to any of these cutscenes during our preview, but I did get to race as a variety of different characters – each of whom have different abilities that alter how they fill their power gauge, and how their cars handle. There’s a really significant difference in car feel across characters so, even though the handling is quite easy to pick up, it’s not one-note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Milestone achieved the improbable in 2021 with Hot Wheels Unleashed, creating a gorgeous and highly approachable arcade racing banger that far exceeded any expectations one might have had of a game based on a licensed toy. It’s a very different sort of racing experience to the Hot Wheels Unleashed series but, after my hour with it, I’m not expecting Screamer to quietly come and go when it arrives in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

Either way, Sony says these bundles will only be available in limited quantities, so if you’re looking to grab one, you’ll want to be ready for when preorders open.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click">PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro Console Covers -

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to believe it's been four years since I first set sail and fell in love with Valheim. As a fan of survival crafting and all things Norse, it's one of the best experiences out there in both regards. And while it still feels fairly familiar at the outset – and somehow it’s still calling itself “early access,” whatever that means anymore – it's gotten a mountain of patches since launch, with a list of changes that would take longer to read than the rambling tangent about some side character's great-grandfather in a viking saga. From new biomes and new bosses to crafting and combat improvements, the version of Valheim you can download today cuts like a blade that developer Iron Gate has been sharpening winter in and winter out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that still holds true today, except that the world has gotten much bigger and just about every system has been improved on in some small or large way. Except greydwarves. They're still annoying as hell. But we'll get to that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Good news for melee builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This revisit is based on the opt-in beta patch announced at Gamescom 2025, known as the Call to Arms update, and that’s fitting because it's brought some of the most significant changes to combat yet. Trinkets are a new equipment slot that lets you build up adrenaline by skirmishing – basically a super meter if you're familiar with fighting games – with different effects at full adrenaline for different trinkets. They've also added a "perfect dodge" that makes it possible to run a melee build without a shield, as long as you're good at timing enemy attacks. And perfect blocks no longer cost stamina, which makes that build way more viable too. Finally, the reign of the stealth archer may be coming to an end! Well, probably not entirely, but at least it won't be so far ahead of other playstyles. Just like nearly everything else that's changed in Valheim over the years, combat is the same system that's always been here but just a bit better and deeper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We finally get (killed by) bears!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The mascot for this patch, though, is the lumbering bear enemy. Why did it take this long to put a bear in the viking survival game? I don't know, but I'm glad she's here now. Sitting somewhere between greydwarves and trolls in terms of difficulty, bears add some much-needed enemy variety to the early areas where most people end up spending a majority of their time anyway. And collecting bear parts lets you build a new weapon and armor set that really lean into the super-aggressive melee playstyle. I'm worried that these items will be completely underpowered in the mid-late game, but it's nice for the first leg of your adventure to be able to go full berserker.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Journeying through mist and flame adds mythological flair</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the bigger picture, Valheim has become a much more complete saga since I originally reviewed it. Two additional biomes, the foggy Mistlands and burning Ashlands, have been added along with their attendant bosses, but I haven't been able to check the latter out yet on this fresh save I made for the patch where I'm about 25 hours in. As a matter of fact, even with well over 100 hours in Valheim overall across multiple playthroughs, I've still never seen the Ashlands – added just last year – at all, actually. The world is huge! And that's very exciting. There's still a bit left to go on the roadmap, with one major boss and one biome still missing, but it's much closer to the finish line than it is to the start. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these! Here are my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in my initial Early Access outing, I said I could barely tell this is an Early Access game, and that's only become more and more true. The amount that's already here could take you months to chew through playing off and on like I do. The final 1.0 release might be out already by the time you finish the Ashlands if you start today. The sheer amount of time it would take to even run into a proverbial Under Construction sign puts them out of reach of what most of my playthroughs have even come close to accomplishing. And I have to ask: if it takes 60-plus hours for me to even notice something isn't finished, is it really unfinished at all? Or am I just waiting for an expansion to come out? It kind of feels more like the latter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Swamps are still a bummer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Every new area has fresh enemies, unique survival challenges, new recipes to discover, and a strong theme. Higher-level biomes pull in more mythological elements that really remind you you're not in Kristiansand anymore. Moving from the Black Forest into the Swamps is still a rough transition with how much more unforgiving the terrain, enemies, and status effects become – right at the same time that travel distances are becoming an issue, and before you can unlock portals. It's no surprise to me that that's where a lot of my runs have ended. Plus, who likes a stinky poison swamp anyway? It's definitely my least favorite biome, even in the latest patch. But it's worth getting through to see what comes after it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Greydwarves are still annoying as hell</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Greydwarves in the Dark Forest remain annoying little pests that come to bother you all the time and present very little combat challenge. If we could craft a trinket that scares away lower-level enemies, I think that would be great. Remember the Morrowind mod that added a belt that would zap cliff racers out of the air? Are Valheim players too young to remember Morrowind? You know what, don't even answer that. I don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Survival Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mining feels less grindy, but maybe that's just character development on my part</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gear progression feels a lot less grindy now as well. I haven't compared the numbers to see how much of that is actual changes to ore drop rates and carry weights and how much it's just that I've gotten used to how time-consuming it is. I no longer feel like I'm spending hours and hours teching up from stone to bronze. And while I was initially annoyed by the lack of realism in the fact that repairing items doesn't cost crafting mats… I have to admit I was wrong. It's a great little quality-of-life feature that I don't have to go hunt down extremely rare materials to keep my best gear nice and shiny. It’s good to know that once I craft something, it's mine forever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The building system could still use some work</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building is one area where I think other survival crafting games have kind of left Valheim behind, mainly in terms of how fiddly it can get. I know part of this is that it's meant to be fairly realistic, and I respect that. But the variety of structural building pieces, especially early on, is still kind of disappointing. And it remains a massive pain to work on rooftops or anything high up due to how stairs, ladders, and slopes behave. As unrealistic as it is, I find myself wishing for something as simple as Minecraft scaffolding, which lets you ascend up to whatever height you need just by holding jump. I know we can't have Dune: Awakening-style hovering in fantasy Scandinavia. Maybe I could send a raven up there to help me place stuff? Just some ideas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One of the best survival crafting games ever has only gotten better</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I adored Valheim when it was roughly half the adventure it is now. The world has gotten so much richer and the progression so much deeper in the four years since, while even mechanics I was interacting with on my first day of a new playthrough have improved in small and subtle ways. If it doesn't lead the pack for the whole genre outright, it's at least very close to the front, howling gleefully as its charming, low-res 3D art style beckons me into calm meadows and foreboding dungeons. I haven't ever really stopped playing it for more than a handful of months at a time since it launched in early access, and the idea of starting a new world always gets me excited even if I know the first few verses of the saga by heart at this point.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/valheim-review-update-2025-call-to-arms]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Every time Hello Games is readying an update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, studio founder Sean Murray tweets out cryptic emoji that send the community's head spinning. For the <a href="http://nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Voyagers update</a>, he posted a waving emoji, followed by a group of three waving emoji to hint at the major feature of the update: ships big enough to travel around in with your friends.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZLz1MW0aE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Voyagers update brings Corvette-class ships to the galaxy. Where the one-seater ships we've piloted thus far are pretty limited in customization, you'll build your Corvette "piece by piece" with full customization, meaning that your ship will be truly unique. You'll be able to customize both the inside and outside, designing the ship through a ship-designer menu that doesn't seem that different from Starfield's version. The update even includes different interior styles and cockpits, so that you can make your ship feel like the Millennium Falcon, filled with readouts and switches, or go for something more streamlined like Star Trek. There are a bunch of working ship modules that will enhance the functionality and stats of your ship, too, so this isn't purely cosmetic.</p><p>Once built, you can get out of your chair and walk around the inside. If you hop on with friends, you can travel the galaxy together, all in one ship.</p><p>There's even a new spacewalking mechanic to let you step out the airlock of your Corvette, to float around in space or jump from your Corvette to your friend's.</p><p>The update also adds graphical enhancements to glass, to player lighting, and more, along with DLSS 4 compatibility.</p><p>And of course, Hello Games also saw fit to add an Expedition to the game to speed up initial ship building.</p><h2>No Man's Sky Voyagers Update Patch Notes</h2><h3>Corvette-class Starships</h3><ul><li>Added a new class of starship, the Corvette. Corvettes are large, fully bespoke ships with furnished interiors, capable of accommodating multiple passengers.</li><li>A lightweight tutorial for assembling your first Corvette will activate upon first collecting a Corvette module or interacting with the Corvette Workshop.</li><li>A large catalogue of snappable structural and decorative modules is available for Corvette assembly, including habitation modules, hulls, wings, engines, windows, accessways, weapons, reactors, shield generators, connectors and decorative peripherals.</li><li>Corvette modules can be unearthed from salvage containers buried on worlds across the universe, as well as discovered in Derelict Freighters.</li><li>Modules can also sometimes be retrieved from defeated pirates, freighter cargo pods, crashed freighter crates, frigate expeditions, or received as rewards for completing missions.</li><li>Structural Corvette modules are collected individually in the inventory and spent directly when assembling a Corvette.</li><li>While standing within a Corvette, specialised furnishings and a selection of base decorations can be installed in the ship's interior. Internal modules can be installed without limitation, but require resources to construct.</li><li>Habitation modules ("habs") form the main living area for Corvette-class starships. Habs are available in three distinct classes: Titan, Thunderbird, and Ambassador, each with its own sci-fi aesthetic.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Victory Royale. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-10-will-feature-gorillaz-starting-tomorrow">Fortnite is the king of crossovers</a>, but the tables have turned in recent years, with Fortnite crossing over into LEGO territory. We've had a handful of sets come out that represent the weird and whacky world of one of the most popular battle royale games, like the Durrr Burger and iconic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-fortnite-battle-bus-a-digital-to-physical-triumph">Battle Bus</a>. The most recent set, which dropped earlier this month, is the gigantic Mecha Team Leader. I'm not the biggest Fortnite player, but even I can't deny how much fun this build was. </p><div catalogid="b1c6547c-25f1-4150-8779-f8bb2aa193e5" id="227362"><div id="227362" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader is easily the biggest build <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-batman-forever-batmobile-set-76304">I've done here on IGN</a>. When the box arrived in the mail I was genuinely surprised at its size. Coming in at just under two feet, the box is absolutely massive. The set itself is comprised of 2,503 pieces and is spread out among 19 bags. The instruction booklet is just as heavy-duty, feeling like a graphic novel at 317 pages. The instructions and sticker sets even came in a premium-feeling envelope to protect it, which I appreciated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I started this build. I've built countless LEGO sets in my day, but truly nothing quite at this scale. I built this in one day because I don't know how to relax, with a couple breaks in between because my kitchen table chairs aren't comfy whatsoever. Overall, I think it took me around five or six hours. Every aspect of the mech's body is exquisitely detailed, each with their own extremely technical and unique attachment techniques. I timed it, and just one leg took me almost an hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not educated on the lore behind the Mecha Team Leader's design, but I think I can speak for everyone when I comment on how ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) this set is. One leg is made up of what looks like ice cream, with an apple foot, while the other foot is a literal cheeseburger. I don't get it, and I don't care; this thing rules. Building the each body part was extremely satisfying, getting to see how in-depth the attachment techniques are. Every limb is movable and posable except for the knees, which unfortunately don't bend. But you can still articulate the mech's arms, hands, and fingers to put it up on your shelf however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite aspects of this build is the huge sword. It cleverly uses a grey LEGO minifigure blank head and ponytail hairstyle to simulate what I'm pretty sure is a fabric tassel on the end of the sword's grip. You can slot the sword into either of the mech's hands, so feel free to pose it however you want, the sword won't fall off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mech's chest cavity opens up to allow a minifigure version of it to enter, and this is also one of the first parts of the build. You build out the pilot cockpit, complete with a detailed chair and screens to survey the battlefield, which are where most of the sticker elements come into play. The mech's armor breastplate itself was fun to build, but I'm questioning some of the sequencing in the steps here; it was difficult to attach the upper breastplate once it was fully assembled to the rest of the body without breaking off other pieces in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teddy bear head really ties the whole set together. It's the last bit of the build, and it also one of my favorite parts. I always appreciate how LEGO designers can take ordinary brick shapes and mold into an extremely detailed, uncanny recreation of what we all know to be a head, and the Mecha Team Leader's head is no different. Its eyes, ears, and little tufts of hair sticking out are awesome little details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I don't play Fortnite, the LEGO Mecha Team Leader is one of my favorite builds I've ever done, whether for IGN or on my own. Once it's all said and done, it stands at almost 18 inches tall. It's an impressively designed and time-consuming build that I highly recommend spacing out over multiple sessions. The minifigure version of the mech, the buildable sword, and "Fortnite" printed LEGO plaque are all great additions to an already great set. I love LEGO and I'm a huge nerd when it comes to appreciating the design of massive, technical sets like this, and I can't wait to see more of what they can cook up.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oh-wow-spider-man-multiplayer-is-here-and-it-looks-amazing.1282476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, a trailer leaked for a cancelled multiplayer<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-pc-port-august-2022-ps4-ps5-steam-sony-plays-1849011465"><em> Spider-Man</em> game</a> that was being developed by Insomniac. It seemed cool. So cool in fact, that it seems to have inspired folks to try and use mods to make online web-swinging with friends a reality. And one such mod is now out, and it looks great.</p> <p>On August 26, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-spider-man-co-op-multiplayer-mod-pc/">as spotted by <em>ComicBook</em></a>, a new PC-only mod has been released online that allows people to play Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> with up to six other players. The mod was developed by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hbgda">modder hbgda and is available to those who subscribe to the creator’s Patreon</a>. You can see what the mod looks like in action below, courtesy of a video shared by popular creator Kami on TikTok and Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spider-Man Remastered just got a working multiplayer mod on PC and it's amazing.</p> <p>Probably the closest thing we're going to get to The Great Web. <a href="https://t.co/6FeT3JEBbz">pic.twitter.com/6FeT3JEBbz</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1960452836887568680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VqjYrZ2WvCM"> There are also multiple YouTube videos of the multiplayer <em>Spider-Man</em> mod in action</a>, and it looks surprisingly stable for something as ambitious and wild as this. Sure, it’s not perfect, but considering<em> Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> on PC was never designed to support multiplayer, let alone seven people running and swinging around the map at the same time, the fact that this mod is not only playable but looks extremely polished is incredibly impressive.</p>

 <p>Watching footage of hbgda’s mod in action has me hankering to install <em>Spider-Man</em> on my PC and try this out. It also makes me sad that we never got Insomniac’s online multiplayer Spider-Man game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-the-great-web-online-co-op-game-trailer-1851329786">It was reportedly going to be called <em>Spider-Man: The Great Web</em></a> and would have involved hopping between dimensions alongside your friends. Sadly, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>, the game was canceled long before the trailer for it leaked in 2024 in the wake of the December 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">Insomniac data breach.</a></p> <p>While it’s very possible the game wouldn’t have had much staying power, which is a problem for a live-service video game, I would have loved to have been able to invite my pals to swing around NYC with me and cause some chaos. At the very least, I hope we see Insomniac add a multiplayer mode to a future Spider-Man game. Doesn’t have to be something elaborate, just something that looks like this mod, but which is playable on PS5, too.</p> <p>For now, if you want to swing around New York City as Spider-Man with some other Spider-People, your only option is to download this mod and set it up on your PC.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/spider-man-ps4-pc-multiplayer-mod-great-web-insomniac-2000620767]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/september%E2%80%99s-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2.1282461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for September 2025 and it would be fair to say they are underwhelming.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus September 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 2nd September :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>Psychonauts 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>So who had to Google “Viewfinder PS5”, because I did. This is the first time the game has been written about on TSA, even though it was released in July 2023 on PS5 and PC, PS4 the following December, then on Xbox Series X|S this month, and Switch later this year. So what is the game about?</p>

<p><em>“Use an instant camera to challenge perception, redefine reality and reshape the world. View the world through a new lens in this charming and unique first-person puzzle adventure. Reshape a wealth of stunning environments through your instant camera’s viewfinder in order to solve a variety of mind-bending puzzles. Bring photos, paintings, sketches and postcards to life as you reshape reality and slowly uncover the surprising mysteries that lie behind this colourful world.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Viewfinder - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_lIQ2EZRH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up is Stardew Valley which originally launched in 2016 on PC and came to PS4 eight years ago. I seem to remember the PS Vita version was on PS Plus at some point. Does anyone really need to be told what Stardew Valley is about? You do, at the back? Really? Have you been living under a rock for the last ten years?</p>
<p><em>“You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Stardew Valley - Gameplay Trailer | PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A7A1X1TVNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And finally we have the excellent Psychonauts 2 which was released on Xbox back in 2021 with the PS4 version arriving in 2023. Rather than explain what the game is about, why not watch our handy video review! Spoiler: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">It’s great we gave it 9/10</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Psychonauts 2 Review (Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1u6JKe9j3Yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 1st September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>My Hero One’s Justice 2</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/august-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-lies-of-p/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>

<figure><a title="Hollow Knight" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/765883a9dbb65/hollow-knight.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you've been living in the deepest, darkest cave imaginable, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is <em>finally</em> launching next week, on 4th September 2025. Fans have been waiting years to get their hands on the sequel to the critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and suddenly, we have just over a week to go.</p>
<p>Team Cherry has sold <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-has-now-sold-almost-15-million-copies">almost 15 million copies of its hit hand-drawn Metroidvania</a>, but there are still many out there who have yet to dive into Hallownest.</p>
<p>Some have likely bought the game and just never tried it, while others have played a little bit and fallen off. Or, Silksong's announcement might have pushed a handful of people to finally pick up it. Incredibly, the game reached a record number of CCUs (concurrently connected users) on Steam following Silksong's Release Trailer — over <em>eight years</em> since its original release.</p>

<p>We imagine a good chunk of players are those revisiting the game, but that's still an impressive figure. Here at Nintendo Life, editor Gavin Lane has finally started his long trek through the bug world, while this writer here is <em>strongly</em> considering a quick third playthrough, or perhaps even an elusive P5 clear.</p>
<p>Essentially, the hype for Silksong has a bunch of people doing some homework, either seeing what the fuss is all about or refreshing their memories. Has it got you hankering for some tough boss fights and exploration?</p>
<p><em>Let us know how you're preparing for Silksong by voting in our poll below — is this your first time playing Hollow Knight? Are you dipping back in for a second time? Third? Fourth? Tell us!</em></p>

              <p><span>I want to like </span><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>, the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/office-spin-off-first-look-the-paper-nbc-peacock-teaser-1851780331"><i><span>Office </span></i><span>spin-off premiering on Peacock</span></a><span> next month, but it sure knows how to make a bad impression. The show’s first trailer was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-office-paper-trailer-peacock-release-date-oscar-2000616348"><span>miraculously devoid of jokes</span></a><span>, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and hope that its true brilliance would shine in sequences too long to come through clearly if shoved into a two-minute teaser. Well, we now have our first clip of the show, and unfortunately </span><i><span>The Paper </span></i><span>continues to come across like the work of people trying desperately to emulate </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span> without understanding what made it work.</span></p> <p><span>The scene Peacock put out today shows Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), the new editor-in-chief for the </span><i><span>Toledo Truth-Teller</span></i><span>, trying to impress people on the newspaper’s office floor by looking like he and his staff are having a very enthusiastic meeting in one of the private rooms. Important people are watching, and Ned wants them to think that things are going swimmingly and that the team is energized and synergized. But instead of just actually having a meeting, he instructs his employees to pantomime a productive one so the suits outside will think he’s running a productive ship.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As unfunny as it is, it works. Good for him. I hope he can follow up that content meeting with actual content. But what is the joke here? </span><i><span>The Office </span></i><span>had absurd sequences that lasted long enough to be uncomfortable, but they were laced with one-liners, had pointed criticism of its office of assholes, or at least made you cringe from second-hand embarrassment. This whole charade doesn’t go anywhere. It’s just a couple of people being confused, most of the group playing along, and a suit being successfully hoodwinked. No punchline.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Paper | New Series Sneak Peek | Peacock Original" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbuaBS3LtWA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>The Paper</span></i><span>’s 10-episode season premieres next week on September 4, and I really hope that Peacock is just holding back the good stuff. I don’t need the spin-off to be exactly the same as the original, but it would be nice if it didn’t feel so sauceless. </span></p>

                <p>Cult filmmaker John Carpenter seems to have been having a moment at Gamescom 2025. Not only does his name grace the title for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zombie-swarms-and-vehicle-tech-make-john-carpenters-toxic-commando-more-than-just-another-co-op-fps/1100-6534250/" data-ref-id="1100-6534250">Toxic Commando</a>, Saber Interactive's fun evolution of the zombie co-op FPS, but his sci-fi horror, The Thing, is also a key influence of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/directive-8020s-narrative-fast-travel-feels-like-a-boon-for-completionists/1100-6534319/" data-ref-id="1100-6534319">Directive 8020</a>. Topping it off, it was during the show where the previously announced Halloween, based on the horror classic with Carpenter himself attached as executive producer, had its first trailer it was announced that his defining slasher horror classic Halloween is being turned into a game, with Carpenter himself attached as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">Given it's being developed by Illfonic--the studio behind other licensed horror or horror-adjacent games like Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Predator, and Ghostbusters--in collaboration with Gun Media, Compass International Pictures, and Further Front, it shouldn't be a surprise to learn that this will consist of asymmetrical multiplayer. But this isn't just going to be Friday the 13th: The Game swapping out Jason Vorhees for Michael Myers. For one, the announcement confirms that Halloween will be both a single-player and multiplayer horror experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Although Friday the 13th did technically feature single-player content, these were essentially challenge missions that featured no narrative. Sitting down with design director Jordan Mathewson, he explains that this is very much a story mode experience that the studio is working on with Pollard Studio, the Shanghai-based studio behind Karma: The Dark World. "It does have narrative and cinematic components to really give it a lot of story and exploration into what it is doing," he says. "But we've also been building a lot and iterating in a way that allows us to build a type of experience that stands apart from multiplayer and give you a completely different look at what this type of game can be."</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, apart from the announcement trailer, there has been no further reveal of the gameplay--not even behind closed doors--and so it's still too early to have a clear idea of what to expect from Halloween's story mode, apart from that it will put you in the boots and behind the mask of Michael Myers. But from what I'm able to learn from Matthewson, it sounds deliciously like a serial killer's version of Hitman.</p><p dir="ltr">As Halloween will be using the 1978 movie as its blueprint, that means the setting is in the sleepy rural and suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. "All the decorations, the characters, the clothing are all from the 1970s," he explains. "It's been a lot of fun exploring what that means, and everything that comes with having that kind of technology back then when it comes to actually making the single-player is a big portion of this compared to our previous titles."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Haddonfield may have you just thinking of the iconic suburban neighborhood, its grounded and familiar setting being what elevates the horror when a terrifying killer is let loose in it, Matthewson also assures me that there will be a variety of maps that go beyond that neighborhood. "There's a lot more to Haddonfield that you see throughout the movie that we'll be exploring and making sure there's different types of maps that have different sizes and different types of play styles associated, so it does lend itself to different experiences as you get set on these different maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Having what sounds like large sandbox maps is going to be crucial to Halloween's more slow-paced and stealth-based gameplay. Whereas Friday the 13th boiled down to Jason trying to kill as many counselors as possible within a time limit, Halloween's Haddonfield isn't just a map but a simulation of '70s suburbia, so there will be a lot of NPCs also going about their own routines on Halloween night. The twist is that any one of these can be targets for Myers.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the Agent 47 comparison comes into play, as Myers needs to bide his time, observing an NPC, staying in the shadows, until the opportune moment to kill comes. What this means is that rather than playing as targets trying to escape, the goal of other players is to prevent the massacre from occurring by rescuing the targeted townsfolk, such as convincing them to leave their homes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very stealthy on both sides since Michael of course doesn't want to be seen and he has a more methodical approach, but the civilians are obviously trying to stay out of sight until they have the means to try and combat him," explains Matthewson. Just as it is that assassinating a target out in the open can have everyone coming after you in Hitman, so too it seems that Michael's massacre can be more difficult to pull off if he gives himself away. It will also be possible for the civilian players to escalate things. "You can try to call the cops and convince them there's a murderer on the loose. If the cops come to investigate and start finding evidence, they'll send more and more that create a much more difficult challenge for Michael. He's very powerful, but at the same time, the authority figures will challenge him."</p><p dir="ltr">But without seeing this in action, I can't quite picture in my head how this plays out. Is the bogeyman seriously going to be deterred by a bunch of smalltown cops? If Michael Myers is such a foreboding presence, I also can't imagine his stealth options are going to involve crouching in a bush, but if not then how does he stay stealthy? And given that this game is sticking to just the 1978 movie, which was arguably his most grounded depiction, does that limit the kind of powers he will have when facing both other players as well the rest of the town?</p><p dir="ltr">Alas, those are details we'll have to wait for Illfonic to reveal at a later date. Nonetheless, Matthewson assures me that the studio has been doing a lot of research and working directly with IP holder Compass to explore what Michael is truly capable of. "It retains that grounded nature because it is meant to exist in a reality where you feel vulnerable and you feel like you're in a familiar setting," he says. "It's been really fun to explore that side of it, and making sure we stick to it but then also getting to jump back to Michael's perspective and expand on it in a way that makes it a really interesting, fun, powerful experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Halloween will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Supermassive Games has already proven itself as one of the most popular storytellers in interactive cinematic horror--since Until Dawn's release a decade ago, more than half a dozen similar titles that focus on different monsters have been released. Directive 8020 is the latest of these as part of its anthology series The Dark Pictures, and sees the developer charting new territory in space.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien is one major cornerstone, the film that really showed us how terrifying space can be, while you also play as a crew on board the ship Casseopeia who are due to awake from cryosleep. There's even a touch of 2001: A Space Odyssey, given the presence of a talking supercomputer called Oracle, though playing through the first episode, I don't have enough reason to be suspicious. The grave threat instead is a meteorite that's breached the ship's hull, which has also brought some kind of alien fleshy matter on board that can mimic the appearance of the crew. This is essentially The Thing in space.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Supermassive Game Directive 8020 Pulls Inspiration From The Thing</p>
      </div>
<p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibY6uKgpvw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ibY6uKgpvw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While that will no doubt open up to paranoia among the crew when you're going to question who is or isn't human, at this point the ship only has two monitoring crew up and about, Tomas Carter and Sims, so when the latter suddenly starts behaving murderously aggressive, it's no surprise that something's not right.</p><p dir="ltr">The formula for Supermassive's interactive horror typically involves making choices and reacting to quicktime events, with the occasionally awkward moments of actually controlling a character in third-person. But given that there are times you're going to be hunted, creative director Will Doyle explains that this has meant that Directive 8020's control systems couldn't just follow on from its past Dark Pictures titles.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way the character moves, and the way the camera works [has been] rebuilt from the ground up, and that's to support some of the stealth gameplay that we've put in," he explains. "We've got these real-time threats, who will hunt you down and kill you. So that complete overhaul is new to this game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the same time, a more traditional third-person adventure format also allows for more exploration and puzzles, as you can turn on a flashlight to navigate the creepy, dark corridors of the ship, and also have a scanner that's used for interacting with certain objects. I'm not fully convinced that these sections of gameplay will prove enjoyable--when I play a cinematic horror game, it just feels plodding to be walking around and handling very mundane interactions that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor. It also doesn't help that the build I played also had some awkward moments when the prompt wouldn't come up if you were standing too close to an object--a bug the team had already warned me about in advance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, Doyle insists that this is intentional in the game's design philosophy. "A lot of traditional action-adventure games have these design loops where you're getting ammunition, and we see story as the reward in those loops," he explains. "We have a load of stuff hidden around the world, but they're advancing the story all the time. So within our discovery sections, where you're moving around in control of your character, as well as evading threats, you're also unraveling pieces of this mystery, so the story gets driven throughout."</p><p dir="ltr">However, the new mechanic that intrigues me the most is Turning Points, which essentially breaks down every narrative decision into a story beat that you can not only chart on a menu screen but also return to. In past games, when a decision occurs or a character dies, the story continues and there's no way to undo it. While this way of playing the game still remains in Survivor mode for those who want to live and die by their decisions, I also wondered if the ability to rewind is due to there being more direct character control that can lead to potentially more frustrating mistakes, especially for a more casual audience not used to playing with a controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doyle recalls that there have been players of the studio's past games who have actually stopped playing when a favorite character died because they couldn't be bothered with trying again. And while he admits that Turning Points alleviate this frustration, and helps make the game more approachable for a player worried about their skill level, he says the mechanic is really there to enhance the game for narrative-focused players. Meanwhile, a range of accessibility settings also allow you to effectively reduce the enemy AI to a ghost-themed train ride, where they may be scary but won't ever catch or kill you.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Turning Points are] a save system, but within each individual beat, you can go back to characters who are alive or dead based on decisions made," he explains. "If you rewind to a decision point, you can explore different paths. You can pass anywhere you've been in the story. So when you see the [narrative] tree, you can explore all the way down on the tree. We want people to play the game however they want to play."</p><p dir="ltr">So rather than a rewind mechanic like say, Max's power in Life Is Strange, it's actually better to think of Turning Points as more like a fast-travel system in a narrative game, and a more elegant way to explore different decision paths than save-scumming.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can rewind all the way back as far as you want to go, so even at the end of the game, I can jump right back to any point," Doyle adds, and it's here that the system feels like it's going to be the most beneficial for both completionists who want to comb through every secret or piece of content in the game without having to replay from start to finish. Think of it like being able to skip to any chapter of a DVD, but a lot more interactive. "For [Trophy/Achievement] hunters, there's still a challenge to seeing everything, but the Turning Points [allow] you to whizz back to where you need to get to make those changes. And that's kind of the magic of what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">Directive 8020 releases for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

These are buffs and tweaks to each character’s abilities that the player chooses between over the course of a match. Cassidy, the gunslingin’ cowboy of the roster, has a pretty packed season between his new fire-based mythic weapon and being the face of the </span><a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1960039614049059292"><span>Luka Dončić collaboration event</span></a><span>, but his greatest boon is that his new perk is absolutely busted.</span></p> <p><span>One of Cassidy’s new perks is called Silver Bullet, and it replaces his rapid-fire “Fan the Hammer” secondary fire with a piercing shot that inflicts Bleed on its target. So not only does it shoot through enemies, but it inflicts damage over time on them as well. You can also zoom in when using it for more precision, which is always helpful for a hitscan hero. Its cooldown resets when you use his dodge roll, so you can pop these suckers off in rapid succession and do some real damage. Combine it with his mythic weapon Blazing Sun and you’ve got a fireworks show going on over the payload. However, it looks like it might be busted, as players found that if you press both primary and secondary fire at the same time, the damage is doubled.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So there is a bug with silver bullet that if you aim it and like instantly cancel it with roll and shoot in quick succession it does like double the damage it's supposed to <a href="https://t.co/QyNcbfmSQk">pic.twitter.com/QyNcbfmSQk</a></p> <p>— Kaladin (@KaladinMeow) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaladinMeow/status/1960502342706717042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Fans are calling this latest patch one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s buggiest, but I guess when you’re overhauling a system like Perks there’s bound to be stuff that falls through the cracks. Wrecking Ball, the mech-piloting hamster tank, has been temporarily removed from standard play while Blizzard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1n0ylfz/comment/navcxot/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>fixes a game-breaking bug</span></a><span> that gave him too much momentum when moving while grappled to an object, and Hazard is able to use his block ability forever, rather than having to stop for a cooldown as he’s supposed to.</span></p>    <p><span>As indicated by the comments on @mi7supp’s video above, some players are reporting issues with Venture and Ashe as well. Hopefully Blizzard will have these squashed in the coming days. While it’s not a great start to the season, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a lot going on in season 18, including a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span> that will add new skins and cosmetics based on Atlus’ high school social sim RPGs.</span></p>

                <p>Bethesda is not finished supporting 2023's spacefaring RPG Starfield. Lead creative producer Tim Lab said in a new video that fans can look forward to many new updates to the game over time, including a second story DLC.</p><p>"I'm really excited for players to see what the team has been working on. We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story," he said. "I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The PlayStation Plus Essential tier gives subscribers free games every month, and recently, those games have been particularly excellent. Last month's offerings included Lies of P, one of the best games of 2023, but the upcoming September lineup <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">announced on the PS Blog</a> manages to top even that; you'll get Psychonauts 2, Viewfinder, and Stardew Valley, one of the most beloved indie games of all time.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley got a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/03/19/stardew-valley-16-patch-drops-today-heres-what-to-expect">substantial 1.6 update last year</a>, so if you haven't played it in a while, you'll be greeted by some new features, including new dialogue, new crafting recipes, hats for pets, and, for some reason, the ability to drink mayonnaise. I don't know who's out there saying, "I'd love to play Stardew Valley, but it's a deal breaker that you can't drink mayo straight from the jar," but if that's you, you're in luck.</p><p>The other two games are nothing to sneeze at either. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/psychonauts-2/psychonauts-2-review-well-worth-the-wait">Psychonauts 2 scored a nine from us</a> when it released back in 2021 and even made its way onto <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2021">our top ten list from that year</a>. It's the long awaited sequel to Double Fine's platformer from 2005, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/07/05/the-history-of-double-fine-productions">we did a retrospective on the studio's history</a> back when it was featured on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/336-psychonauts-2">the cover of Game Informer issue 336</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/viewfinder/short-and-smart">Viewfinder is a delightful puzzle game</a> from 2023 that reminds me of Portal in the best way – its photographic puzzle solving is incredibly creative game design.</p><p>All three games will be available for subscribers on September 2. You can still download August's games (Lies of P, My Hero One's Justice 2, and DayZ) until then.</p><hr><p><em>Will you be checking these games out on September 2? Let us know in the comments!</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/stardew-valley-headlines-the-ps-plus-september-lineup]]></content:encoded>

<p>The director of Elden Ring’s film adaptation may be a bigger fan than we thought, given his script size. A recent article from The New Yorker sheds some insight as to how the upcoming A24 film came to be. Even more so, it does hint that the film may be in the right hands after all.</p>



<p>Winner of multiple Game of the Year awards in 2022, Elden Ring was a hit for Bandai Namco and FromSoftware. The intense gameplay and insane difficulty, much like the studio’s Dark Souls series, kept fans playing and is still regarded as one of director Hidetaka Miyazaki’s best. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-movie-finally-confirmed-by-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a film adaptation was announced</a> from indie studio A24 and director Alex Garland. The filmmaker, known for Ex Machina and 28 Days Later, was an interesting choice given the game’s scope. However, we may actually be in luck if Garland’s obsession is true.</p>

<p>In an article on A24 from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/09/01/a24s-empire-of-auteurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The New Yorker</a>, head of film Noah Sacco chatted with Alex Barasch about the studio. While talking about it’s upcoming big blockbusters, Sacco mentions meeting with Alex Garland five years ago. Previously, the director did Ex Machina, Civil War, and Warfare with A24. While there, Garland showed off Elden Ring on PlayStation to Sacco and asked if they could adapt it for the studio. When Sacco agreed, Garland proceeded to write a 160-page script, alongside 40 illustrations, for his version of Elden Ring. The two flew out to Japan once it was done and showed it off to FromSoftware and director Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>



<p>As you can tell, the deal went well and now the film is greenlit, with many original contributors like Game of Thrones’ George R.R Martin producing. Interestingly enough, this is the second video game film that A24 will produce. Death Stranding, directed by A Quiet Place: Day One’s Michael Sarnoski, is in the works. Regardless, given Alex Garland’s enthusiasm for Elden Ring, the film may turn out to be better than other game film adaptations.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics, the studio behind the recent Tomb Raider games and a co-developer of the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot, has announced that it was holding layoffs.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Wednesday, the studio said it <strong>“made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions.”</strong></p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics says that the decision <strong>“was not made lightly”</strong>, but was one that it says was needed to <strong>“ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“To those impacted – we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion,”</strong> they said.<strong> “We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as the future of Tomb Raider, Crystal Dynamics says that it’s development is unaffected by the moves.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Crystal Dynamics for more context surrounding the layoffs, exactly how many people were being let go, and if the recent cancellation of Perfect Dark had anything to do with the decision. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>
