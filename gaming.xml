		<p>We need more games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>. I’m not talking about its specific blend of gameplay – though a few copycats wouldn’t go amiss, if you ask me –but rather that it’s Capcom that’s making it. With so much focus on AAA games that take the better part of a decade to produce, it’s always refreshing to see smaller teams within major publishers producing niche and inventive games that have become the preserve of indie developers in recent years. Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is one such game, and could be a real surprise for anyone that dances on over when it comes out later this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - &quot;Soh&quot; Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LvYXyFdYLM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How to describe Kunitsu-Gami is a tricky one, though. There’s so many elements at play, but you can see the shadows of Monster Hunter, Pikmin, Kingdom: Two Crowns and plenty more besides dancing across its backlit tapestry. And that tapestry is a gorgeously woven rendition of Japanese mythology and religion that skips and dances across your screen.</p>


<p>The game’s story sees you trying to cleanse Mt. Kafuku of the defilement by twisted and evil spirits known as the Seethe. As the Seethe spread across the mountain, it consumed small villages dotted across the slope, leaving villagers cocooned while creepily many-handed growths have sprouted at various points around each locale.</p>


<p>It’s your quest, as Soh, to guide the divine maiden Yoshiro through each village, free their inhabitants, and fight back against the waves of the Seethe that attack at night. There’s a clear divide between daytime and night, with the former all about rapid exploration and preparation, and the latter then takes on the tone of a tower defence game as you protect the Maiden from attack.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to do during the preparatory phase, as you race around the map trying to destroy core patches of corruption and free villagers –&nbsp;you earn a bonus for clearing everything within a village, in the form of a new Tsuba Guard ability that could be a flashy attack, a group buff, or more. You also have to decide how far Yoshiro should move through the village along the main path of corruption that needs cleansing, triggering her ritualistic dance toward the utterly consumed Torii gate at the end of the stage.</p>
<p>Yoshiro will only be able to move so far in a day, though, and if she can’t reach a gate in time, the Seethe will spew out once again, so a village cleansing level will often require multiple day-night cycles to overcome and feature multiple gates to cleanse. So you need to spot the most defensible points, light beacons to illuminate the surroundings, fix up barriers and more in order to prepare. You also need to give any rescued villagers a class defining mask to let them fight alongside you. From an axe toting Woodcutter, to an archer, or an Ascetic that can slow and debuff enemies, and beyond, you’ll have to make choices based on the kinds of Seethe coming out of the gate, and the place them to cover paths and attack lanes. Thankfully, you can very quickly switch their roles and move them during the night, adapting to the oncoming waves.</p>

<p>You also have Soh himself, who is a master of “dancing swords” combat. Through the few levels I played, I would often race right into the action and unleash my simple sword attack combos, while having the villagers set up more to defend Yoshiro and clear up anything that snuck past me. The main trouble at this early point was with the flying Seethe, as I had yet to unlock Soh’s bow to more easily take them down, but there were further challenges that emerged, such as an enemy that would buff and protect the Seethe around them.</p>
<p>After successfully cleansing a stage, that village then becomes a hub that you can revisit, upgrade, and apply improvements to Soh and the various mask classes you have. Running around the now serene mountainside villages, you can assign the villagers construction and repair tasks that will be completed after your next mission, rewarding you with the materials and currency needed to then improve your kit. There’s also a tent for Yoshiro to hang out in, and visiting her will let you add upgrades for the masks you’ve collected so far, swap between Tsuba Guard abilities, and so on.</p>

<p>But then there’s the Festering Seethe, giant monsters that bring out those Monster Hunter and Pikmin comparisons, as you and a small band of villagers step into their arenas and seek to do battle. The most imposing of these that we faced was an oversized centipede monster that would rampage around a darkened arena, occasionally knocking gross grubs from the ceiling to attack Yoshiro. It’s a battle of health bars, as you once again need to protect Yoshiro and fight off smaller Seethe, but also have to deal damage to the main boss and, in the case of this particular beast, during the right times.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of depths to the tactics and strategy in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess that I wasn’t able to explore during my hands on time, but I already love the game’s blend of gameplay, visual stylings and overarching tone. It’s a game that at many points can look serene and in complete control as Yoshiro performatively progresses through a stage, but feels like a madcap dash and struggle to get everything done and prepared just in time to keep her safe in the fight against the Seethe.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-dlc-updated</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-updated-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree.916218/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-dlc-updated<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>seamless co-op mod has been updated to add&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>support, which means it's now theoretically possible to play through the entire DLC in a single co-op session.</p>
<p>The aptly-named Seamless Co-op mod&nbsp;was updated yesterday, with a rewritten version adding support for the open-world RPG's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date">recently-released DLC</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The downside, however, is that Seamless Co-op is in beta for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. The devs say that the mod has been completely rewritten and thus "requires extended beta testing", urging&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>PC players to "be understanding" if they check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8Xf6UNJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-shadow-of-the-erdtree.jpg?itok=8lH_5rq6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get ready to experience&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>with your squad in tow.</figcaption></figure><p>In theory, this mod should allow you to journey through the Land of Shadow with your friends without needing to send them home after bosses, but since the mod is in beta, some teething troubles should be expected.</p>
<p>However, the base game's mod theoretically allows players to continue playing alongside one another as part of a continuous session. This means that players who die won't be returned to their home worlds, and if players vanquish a boss together, they'll remain in the same world.</p>
<p>Everyone in a session can mount and ride Torrent, and NPC dialogue will be synchronized across players, as will map waypoints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, in theory, all of this is now possible for&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, but you'll have to copy across any save data you have from the base game, as saves for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;Seamless Co-op mod are technically treated as different entities.</p>
<p>You can find detailed instructions on how to install the mod, as well as any other steps you might need to take, over on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nexus Mods page for Seamless Co-op</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-party.jpg?itok=A7kW4rnZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-party.jpg?itok=pgjMiNbv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some teething troubles should be expected when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>&nbsp;Seamless Co-op&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>implementation.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a major expansion for From Software's punishing action-RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC launched last week to rapturous reviews and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">strong sales</a>, although some players are divided on its difficulty and PC performance. From Software and publisher Bandai Namco have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-easier">since issued an update</a> that adjusts the difficulty curve slightly, although it's unlikely to address every player concern in this area.</p>

            <p>
Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) must pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee who brought a discrimination claim against the company.
</p>
<p>
The case, filed by Star Citizen senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion, revolves around a return-to-work policy that also involved work from the company's new central Manchester office location - some 15 miles from its previous Wilmslow location. 
</p>
<p>
Ah-Thion, who previously worked in-office at Wilmslow, brought the case after his requests to work remotely rather than travel into central Manchester were denied and he was subsequently terminated.

<p>
CIG had previously allowed Ah-Thion and other employees to work remotely for several years, but in 2022 decided to take a "tougher" stance on remote work, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a> reported.
</p>
<p>
The tribunal dismissed "rather retrospective" claims by CIG that Ah-Thion's performance had been a concern, and decided that allowing him to work from home would have been a "reasonable adjustment".
</p>
<p>
CIG's penalty of £27,748 includes more than £14k of lost earnings, and £12k compensation for injury to feelings.
</p>
<p>
"I've been fighting this by myself for two years, and being autistic made the whole process especially challenging," Ah-Thion said. "But we're lucky to have the employment tribunal system, where an ordinary person can actually find justice without having to bankrupt themselves on legal fees.
</p>
<p>
"It was clear to me from the start that CIG didn't want people to work from home after the expense of their new Manchester office, and worked backwards from that to retroactively conjure up reasons why my request should be denied, something they continued to do right up until the final tribunal hearing - all while ignoring disability legislation. It was gratifying that the tribunal saw through them as easily as they did."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted CIG for comment. 
</p>
<p>CIG has now raised more than <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">$711m</a> in funding for Star Citizen, its long-in-the-works space MMO. In 2022 it laid out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-lays-out-increasingly-ambitious-five-year-plan">ambitious plans for growth in the UK</a>, including the opening of the aforementioned Manchester studio, with a plan to grow the company's then-400-person team to 1000 by 2026.</p>

But in the time since their separation, the Roman empire—led by Pascal’s (<em>The Last of Us</em>, <em>The Mandarin</em>) character Marcus Acacius—has begun encroaching on North Africa, where Lucius has been in hiding.</p><figure id="" data-id="ceb75bc28e8168fd747c762580a150dd" data-recommend-id="image://ceb75bc28e8168fd747c762580a150dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal fight as gladiators." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal fight as gladiators." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Vanity Fair</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb75bc28e8168fd747c762580a150dd" data-recommend-id="image://ceb75bc28e8168fd747c762580a150dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal fight as gladiators." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All roads lead back to the gladiatorial matches, and for more on the minutiae of how <em>Gladiator II</em> ties into the original movie, be sure to check out <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s write-up.

I’m iffy on if <em>Gladiator </em>needs a sequel when it wrapped up so well over 20 years ago, but for a chance to see Pascal and Mescal on the big screen doing hot boy shit? I will sit through most things.<br></p><p><em>Gladiator II </em>is set to hit theaters on November 22, but the first trailer will premiere next week on July 9.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The developers that appear on camera seem to suggest that,though they’re currently planning for the new <em>Crazy Taxi </em>to be a massively multiplayer game, the team currently lacks programmers with the skills to build the infrastructure. Development on the new <em>Crazy Taxi </em>game seems early days, and as such, the interview partially functions as a call for more developers to join Sega and help make the title. As spotted by <em>Automaton</em>, the <em>Crazy Taxi </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recruitment page</a></span> has several listings calling the game a “large-scale online title.”</p><p>The team featured in the interview also use language that seems to suggest that plans <em>could </em>change if they don’t work out, but that this is the current direction for the <em>Crazy Taxi </em>revival. The game is currently being developed in Unreal Engine 4 and, as such, will feature a realistic city as one of its maps, as well as a theme park. The goal seems to be to amplify the realism of the environments on this new engine in order to increase the sense of chaos as players barrel through places that are deeply familiar to them.</p><p><em>Crazy Taxi</em>, as folks might remember, has largely been a single-player series with a focus on style (and branding) over realism, which makes some of these statements just a <em>wee </em>bit strange. First arriving in arcades, where it remains pretty popular to this day, <em>Crazy Taxi </em>was eventually released to consoles, but even then, its multiplayer was fairly limited in its later entries, and its visual identity has always remained fairly intact. Sega’s current revival of the series seems to throw many of these tenets out in order to reinterpret them for a modern audience, and I wish em’ the best of luck with that Herculean task.</p><p>Which isn’t to say I’m not on board with some of the stuff that Sega is saying, but merely suggesting that for diehard fans that really wanted the <em>Crazy Taxi</em> series to come back, something this new and distinct will feel heretical. I think most folks probably wanted a version of the game that lives up to their childhood memories of it. Then again, I do know that people, like myself, have enjoyed the variant of <em>Crazy Taxi </em>that exists as a minigame in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a></span>, so maybe this is exactly what the series needs.</p><p>I’m definitely down for making <em>Crazy Taxi </em>a massively multiplayer game, which could live up to the “crazy” in the series’ moniker. Trying to imagine a dozen or so taxis manically faring people up and down a realistic San Francisco brings a faint smile to my face, and if it’s well done, Sega could actually be onto something here. It seems like we won’t see the fruit of Sega’s labor for a while still as it figures out how viable a massively multiplayer <em>Crazy Taxi </em>is, but when we do, I hope it looks and sounds like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNHoWdid7ag&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNHoWdid7ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a hundred taxis blaring The Offspring</a></span> as loud as possible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Much of that has to do with her place in the expansion’s overarching story—in many ways, <em>Dawntrail</em>’s main character feels like Wuk Lamat, rather than the Warrior of Light.

All of these factors have combined to capture the hearts of Warriors of Light everywhere. </p><hr><p>If you too want to enjoy the charms of everyone’s favorite Hrothgar, <em>Dawntrail</em> is currently in Early Access for players who pre-ordered the expansion.

        <p>President Shuntaro Furukawa also says successor won't be impacted by semiconductor shortage</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Nintendo has announced plans to avoid scalping with the release of the Switch's successor by meeting customer demand.</p>
<p>In a general Q&amp;A at a recent shareholders meeting as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-it-wants-to-avoid-switch-2-scalping-by-making-enough-to-meet-demand/">VGC</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors that it would combat resellers by providing enough hardware for retailers to meet demand.</p>
<p>He also noted that Nintendo is no longer affected by the semiconductor shortage, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-sales-dip-3-6-percent-to-usd13-1bn-due-to-semiconductor-shortage">which partly caused the company's sales to dip in 2022.</a></p>
<p>"At present, we do not believe that the shortage of components will have a significant impact on the production of the successor model," Furukawa said.</p>
<p>In May, Nintendo confirmed that while it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-no-switch-2-before-april-2025">"[hasn't] yet discussed the launch timing"</a> for its next console, Furukawa confirmed that the platform holder would <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">make an announcement about the Switch's successor by April 2025</a>.</p>

In this presentation, my goal is to break down the core elements of this career path, its importance in the market today, what skills you’ll need to break into the industry and your future career prospects.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What makes a 2D Marketing Artist?"><span>What makes a 2D Marketing Artist?</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, what exactly does a 2D Marketing Artist do on the daily? They’re a specialist in creating visual materials for marketing campaigns. In my case, for mobile games. All those flashy graphics you see on store pages, announcing which characters you can collect? That’s me. The Marketing Artist’s tasks include developing attractive images that will be used to promote on websites, social networks and other platforms. It’s a key role, as those initial promo pieces are often the first thing a potential player sees. The success of the game and its whole marketing strategy can hinge on the artist’s work.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Main Responsibilities and Tasks"><span>Main Responsibilities and Tasks</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key responsibilities of a 2d Marketing Artist include the creation of marketing materials for advertising banners, icons and posters, as well as elements that video editors will need for assembling into trailers and other promotional footage, including background and character art, item renders, game UI and beyond. This specialist 2D role works closely with directors, producers, the PR team for the game and its broader brand and product teams to create materials that support the overall promotional strategy for the game. One of the key challenges of the rule is to adapt content to fit the many platforms and formats for advertising. It’s a job that has demanded a lot of flexibility and knowledge on specifics and marketing trends from myself, and it’s a challenge that newcomers should be prepared for.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Required Skills and Competencies"><span>Required Skills and Competencies</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To be truly successful in this field, a 2D Marketing Artist must have a broad range of skills. First and foremost, you’ll need artistic skills and training. Drawing, composition and color theory are the obvious cornerstones. Technical skills are also vital - you’ll need to be proficient at working with the industry standard graphics packages, such as Photoshop, Illustrator or Blender 3D. A new demand of many companies is skills in working with generative AI, but this comes second to human artistic talent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Being well versed in the fundamentals of marketing and advertising goes a long way, too. It helps greatly in creating materials that effectively capture an audience’s attention, and requires an analytical mind. No two marketing campaigns are identical, and creating materials based on past creative’s work is often a key part of the job, using gathered metrics to identify that styles worked or not. Much as you might want to avoid them, meetings with directors and producers are vital in understanding the big picture.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Work Process"><span>Work Process</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every set of new marketing materials goes through a multi-step production process. First, the director brings the crew in for a brainstorming session, outlining the creative concepts you’ll be focusing on. The team will discuss and supplement those foundational ideas, and with a final plan drawn up, the artists get to work. It’s important to be able to work with a team, respond to feedback, make edits and adapt your work (however perfect it may already be) to the customer’s wishes. Time management is also important, and you’ll likely be expected to work under tight deadlines - last-minute changes in marketing plans are common in this business.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Career Opportunities"><span>Career Opportunities</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s a clear progression route within this line of work. Entry-level positions include junior marketing artists, where newcomers can develop their skills and experience fresh out of school. With time, experience and a few successful campaigns to put on your resume, you can progress to becoming a senior marketing artist, a specialist (if you find a particular niche) or even team leader, if you’re a people person. It's a field where hard work and continually working on your skill-set can open up great opportunities for professional growth and promotion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s also not unusual for marketing artists to end up working on a game directly, given that the marketing team are so heavily involved in the creation of character, environment and UI art, with their concepts coming straight from the core game team. Whether working solely on the marketing or close to the development team, expect surprises. A good marketing artist is a flexible creature.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges and Features of the Profession"><span>Challenges and Features of the Profession</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every profession faces its own unique set of challenges. As a 2D marketing artist, I’ve encountered a rich and exciting range of creative and technical difficulties, requiring constant self-improvement adaptation. This is a job where you’ll have to think on your feet. New technologies and trends will affect your work, and you’ll be constantly learning and implementing new approaches to your daily routine. This adaptability is now more vital than ever, with the advent of generative AI making its way into the standard artist’s workflow. You’ll be expected to research these new technologies and implement them to accelerate and improve the quality of your output. As a personal example, my team has been actively experimenting with Stable Diffusion and MidJourney, and we’re always looking for new opportunities for improvement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, marketing art is blazing a trail for the product itself, from the point of view of both mechanics and the implementation of new technologies. The marketing team are able to be more agile, implementing and testing new technologies on tangential materials, and able to pass on knowledge of what works to the core game development pipeline. A good marketing team works closely with the developers, after all.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all that said and done, I must reiterate that a professional 2D marketing artist for a mobile studio is a highly agile role. It demands a complex combination of artistic and technical skills, a broad understanding of marketing and what sells well to specific audiences, plus the ability to work as part of a team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s not easy, but it’s an interesting and dynamic profession, with great prospects for career advancement, vertically or laterally, as well as a continually interesting challenge for an artist. I hope to see you and many others joining this booming field in the near future!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/crazy-taxi-reboot-will-be-an-open-world-mmo-sega-says.916167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot will take some risks in terms of direction, with the project supposedly taking the form of an open-world driving MMO that has a multiplayer focus.</p>
<p>Per a new video released by Sega (with additional reporting by the ever-reliable <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-crazy-taxi-title-will-be-an-open-world-massively-multiplayer-aaa-game-according-to-sega/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), the studio is currently working out the specifics of the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot's gameplay and how it will work with "many players at once" (that's Automaton's wording).</p>
<p>Sega's goal is to make the project feel like classic&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>while still introducing new mechanics and systems, so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>fan and you're feeling miffed by the change in direction, you might not have too much cause to worry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sega-crazy-taxi-reboot-gameplay.jpg?itok=lKltAfXH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sega-crazy-taxi-reboot-gameplay.jpg?itok=ZKBPd9l6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>is looking to reinvent the franchise, but it will stick close to the original's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the video (which is entirely in Japanese, so we're looking to Automaton for translation), Sega employees currently working on&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>discuss their vision for the game and what they intend to achieve by making it.</p>
<p>Producer Kenji Kanno says the team is making a "completely new" version of&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>, while his team members mention multiple different maps for the game, including a realistic city, an area inspired by the West Coast, and a theme park-style zone.</p>
<p>Additional information is available via some <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recently-created Sega job listings</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>(which, once again, are in Japanese), calling for staffers to assist with an open-world racer built in Unreal Engine with a massively multiplayer focus.</p>
<p>It might not sound like the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>you're used to, but the footage we see in the video, as well as what was shown <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2023-recap-check-out-all-news-trailers-and-reveals">during last year's Game Awards</a>, seems to hew pretty close to the series' trademark fast-paced arcade racing action, at any rate.</p>

<p>We still don't know exactly when the&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>reboot will arrive (which feels pretty appropriate for a taxi game, am I right?). For that matter, Sega has yet to officially unveil the game in full.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll learn more about this&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em>project in the coming months. Stay tuned for more, and in the meantime, if you're in a nostalgic mood, you can grab the original&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71230/Crazy_Taxi/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right now on PC via Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Former Bungie veteran&nbsp;Dan Gniady is leading the development of the next "Halo experience".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhwa83K3-U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by YouTuber 'Rebs Gaming', Microsoft's Halo studio 343 Industries has hired a new lead game designer back in April of this year. While Gniady's work experience at 343 doesn't include any juicy details about this Halo "experience", there is reference that might interest Halo fans. "Doing game direction on a Halo experience", the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-gniady-aa5b887/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linkedin resume</a> reads. "Giving the Covenant back their bomb". We've included a screenshot of the resume in case it gets pulled or edited.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/next-halo-343.png"></a></figure>

<p>Prior to his work at 343 Industries, Gniady served as Lead Gameplay Designer at Sega's Creative Assembly, at which he worked at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-cancels-hyenas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canned Hyenas</a>. Before joining Creative Assembly, Gniady fulfilled various positions at Bungie, including producer on the original Destiny and its expansions as well as Destiny 2 and its first expansion - The Curse of Osiris. Aside from his role as producer, the nearly a decade-long Bungie veteran worked as a Gameplay Designer on Destiny 2: Warmind, Forsaken, the Black Armory weapon foundry , Season of the Drifter, Shadowkeep, and Beyond Light.</p>
<p>Microsoft has yet to officially confirm a new Halo installment, but late last year, a journalist <a href="https://wccftech.com/343-industries-new-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that 343 Industries is actively working on a new entry within Unreal Engine. "What I can say that I know anyway is, yes, they do have a team [at 343 Industries] working on the next Halo campaign", Seasoned Gaming's editor-in-chief Ains said. "It is part of that restructuring that is building the next generation of Halo on Unreal [Engine]".</p>
<p>Some months back, a resume of a former art director at 343 Industries mentioned work on the "next" Halo. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ue5-powered-new-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> back then, this new Halo might very well be in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about Xbox's Spartan's and, more in particular, John-117.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-player-loses-money-after-winning-the-esports-tournament/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It’s a familiar feeling, the rush of victory, the urge to celebrate. But what if that celebration made a loss more significant than your win? This cautionary tale unfolded at a recent Mortal Kombat 1 esports competition, causing a lot of laughter and a significant financial loss. </p>



<p>CEO 2024, the latest installment of the beloved esports competition, was a battleground for the fighting genre from June 28-30. Mortal Kombat 1 stood out among the games, not just for its intense competition but for a hilarious post-victory mishap. The winner of the Mortal Kombat 1 competition found themselves in a pickle after celebrating a bit too enthusiastically. The mishap involved a chair and an exorbitant light.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mortal Kombat 1 Pro Dyloch was the player who emerged victorious at the competition, and you can tell it wasn’t the easiest of tasks after seeing the way he celebrated his win. Right after serving up the finishing blow, Dyloch’s adrenaline rush led him to toss a chair out of the arena. The chair landed on a costly light, which cost way more than the prize money for the competition. In fact, the cost of the light was nearly five times the amount Dyloch was set to receive.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To put things into perspective, Dyloch was set to receive $565 for winning the Mortal Kombat 1 competition, and the light he destroyed was worth $ 2,992, as pointed out by CEO <a href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807145856337854633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alex Jebailey</a>. </p>



<p>This means that Dyloch owes CEO $2,427 after winning the competition. And Dyloch will have to pay up as Debailey is<a href="https://x.com/Jebailey/status/1807117772087824600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> not bailing him out of this one</a>. However, Dyloch’s recent post on Twitter states that he will be <a href="https://x.com/RezDyloch/status/1807141924387615037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking responsibility</a> for the light as he flexes his new victory belt to the audience. </p>



<p>The moral of the story is that composure is essential, and this incident serves as a powerful lesson for all esports enthusiasts.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>In other news, characters from the upcoming Mortal Kombat 1 DLC were recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-1-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked online</a>. In the comments, let us know what you felt about this Mortal Kombat 1 esports mishap. </figcaption></figure>

The first "Act" of this new approach--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-destiny-2-is-ditching-seasons-for-less-predictable-episodes/1100-6520642/" data-ref-id="1100-6520642">Episodes comprised of three Acts each</a>--has wrapped up its story, but players have noted that the new Episode-based structure doesn't feel all that different to seasons so far. According to Bungie, there's much more on the way, and the new setup is enabling it to build one of its biggest Exotic missions ever, which will release later in 2024.</p><p>"We're going to finish some threads off, but we're also going to start opening up some doors to new stories to be told," game director Robbie Stevens said to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/destiny-2-the-final-shape-edge-feature/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. According to Stevens, Act 2 will introduce "a completely new set of activities" on top of the new Breach Executable activity and will take players deeper into Nessus as the planet transforms. Act Three will see a new Exotic mission debut, one that Stevens described as being an ambitious step forward for Bungie.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Final Shape Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"We have an Exotic mission coming in Echoes Act Three," Stevens said. "It is one of the biggest Exotic missions we've ever built, and it's only possible because of this new content cadence. The ability for us to build this massive Exotic mission--literally one of the biggest--it wouldn't have been possible in the past. This is where we see the [development] team taking the opportunity, their willingness to change, their willingness to adapt to this new cadence with us, and really seize the opportunity to expand Nessus, expand this world."</p><p>Echoes is designed to serve as an epilogue to The Final Shape campaign that examines the fallout of the Light and Darkness Saga's conclusion in greater detail. While Bungie has big plans for Year 11 of Destiny 2, Stevens explained that the studio is aiming to tie up several character stories and "open up some doors" for the franchise. We've already seen the first glimpse of this new approach, as a new Vex antagonist called The Conductor is at the center of Echoes, and the next Episode focuses on fulfilling the Eliksni prophecy of the Kell of Kells and putting an end to the Scorn baron Fikrul, once and for all. Finally, Episode Three will see players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-post-final-shape-future-includes-the-dreadnaught-and-a-tease-of-codename-frontiers/1100-6524116/" data-ref-id="1100-6524116">return to Oryx's Dreadnaught flagship</a>.</p><p>While the first Act of Echoes is over, Destiny 2 players can look forward to two weeks of PvP fun <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-iron-banner-extends-to-two-weeks-with-more-changes/1100-6524577/" data-ref-id="1100-6524577">when the Iron Banner returns</a>. Now a longer event, earning some of the rare loot from that multiplayer mode will be a little easier thanks to the extended duration of Iron Banner and several other tweaks to how it functions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cloud Imperium Games, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, has been ordered to pay $35,000 in compensation to a disabled worker against whom the studio has been found to have discriminated.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, programmer Paul Ah-Thion took Cloud Imperium to tribunal following the instatement of a return-to-work program that didn't include any kind of provision for him and his disability.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion initially worked at Cloud Imperium's Wilmslow office, which was closed during the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating that Cloud Imperium employees work remotely. When Cloud Imperium sought to relocate to Manchester, Ah-Thion requested to work from home indefinitely, but was denied.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-starship.jpg?itok=1fL2Whbb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-starship.jpg?itok=irYYolnq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cloud Imperium Games is the studio responsible for space sim&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, which still hasn't seen a full release.</figcaption></figure><p>According to a judgement document sent to Game Developer, Ah-Thion made several requests to CIG to continue working remotely on a permanent basis, but all of the requests were denied, culminating in his dismissal in 2022.</p>
<p>CIG's argument during the tribunal was that Ah-Thion had failed to fulfil his professional obligations as a result of working from home, and that he was "unable to meet certain job criteria" (that's Game Developer's wording) like training junior employees.</p>
<p>However, the tribunal found that these claims were incorrect, and that by refusing to make adjustments to accommodate Ah-Thion, CIG acted in a discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>The tribunal ordered Cloud Imperium to pay Ah-Thion £27,748 in compensation, a figure which works out at around $35,000.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=S6oXTN1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal-hangar.jpg?itok=jupxDN_Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cloud Imperium will have to pay Paul Ah-Thion tens of thousands of dollars in compensation.</figcaption></figure><p>This decision comes as several publishers and gaming companies ratchet up their efforts to create accessible hardware and software for gamers with accessibility concerns.</p>
<p>These efforts include Sony adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-adding-accessibility-tags-to-playstation-store-on-ps5">accessibility tags to entries on the PlayStation Store</a>&nbsp;and creating an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-access-controller-brings-accessibility-this-december">entire controller based around accessibility</a>, as well as games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-accessibility">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-accessibility-options-revealed">God of War Ragnarok</a>&nbsp;</em>featuring extensive accessibility options.</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen</em>, which has been in production for thirteen years at time of writing, a concrete release date doesn't look like it's any closer to being announced, although Cloud Imperium has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-roadmap-release-2024">said that it will release a roadmap</a> leading up to the game's 1.0 launch this year.</p>

  <p id="1PM0yu">Sega is going through one of those phases when it decides it wants to be Sega again — the Sega of blue skies, killer arcade cabinets, and the glorious unfulfilled promise of the Dreamcast.</p>
<p id="xsOx1O">Last week, the publisher released the first original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24185483/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review-interview">Super Monkey Ball</a> game in a decade. At the Game Awards last December, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23993016/sega-jet-set-radio-streets-of-rage-shinobi-crazy-taxi">the company announced</a> an initiative to bring some of its classic game franchises back to life, including new games in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi series.</p>
<p id="5Ogq1m">That was a fan-pleasing move, though many questioned how (or, indeed, whether) Sega intended to make these games relevant for a modern audience. We now have a partial answer, as far as Crazy Taxi is concerned.</p>
<p id="m01KgF">Sega is moving to staff up the development team making the new Crazy Taxi, and in a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs?category=2010249489979686912">series of job adverts</a>, the game is consistently referred to as a “large-scale online title,” “open world,” and a “massively multiplayer driving game.” The original is a tight, fast-paced arcade driving game about ferrying passengers around a city map as fast as possible.</p>
<div id="Pe1o1o"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0VHYLJR9pNg?rel=0&amp;start=80" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="Jdw4S9">In an ad seeking a <a href="https://hrmos.co/pages/sega/jobs/10">lead game designer</a>, Sega says the project is “aiming to become a global hit, primarily in the North American market.” Sega would prefer its new lead game designer to have experience in both “car game production” and “multiplayer action battle production.” The game is being made in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p id="cZPKOh">Sega also posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLQsitFYpg8">recruitment video</a> (in Japanese) featuring producer Kenji Kanno — the director of the original game — and other developers. In the video (according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/segas-crazy-taxi-reboot-is-a-massively-multiplayer-driving-game/">VGC</a>), the developers talk about adapting the classic Crazy Taxi gameplay for a world with multiple players set on a “theme park-like” city map. Brief work-in-progress clips from the Game Awards announcement video show multiple cabs trailing sparks as they drift around a San Francisco-style city.</p>
<p id="Pth8HD">The news may set off alarm bells about overreach — can a game series that last saw a home console release <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Taxi_3:_High_Roller">in 2002</a> really support a “global hit” in the 2020s, however much nostalgia there is for it? On the other hand, Crazy Taxi’s frantic gameplay and joyously garish style seems well suited to a bustling, competitive online world, and might even support a battle royale-style mode. The idea of a more over-the-top, arcade-coded rival to the likes of Forza Horizon — or, to put it another way, a <em>Fortnite</em> on wheels — doesn’t seem so crazy after all.</p>
<p id="NJqs0t">The new Crazy Taxi — like the reboots of Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage — does not yet have a release date.</p>

On their release in November 2020, both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X were incredibly scarce, thanks to an imperfect storm of covid, global chip shortages, and supply chain issues. At the same time, the three-year-old Switch was also having supply issues, and consoles that <em>were</em> available were quickly snatched up by scalpers. But Nintendo reckons it’s in a position to ensure that’s not a problem with next year’s release of the Switch 2.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,191491,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent shareholder call</a></span> (pdf), Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was reminded that he said a year ago that he would put in place measures to prevent resellers from blocking customer access to the (technically unannounced) new console, and asked what had been done thusfar.

It’s such a peculiar situation that the company is explaining its techniques for ensuring a console isn’t going to sell out before they’ve properly acknowledged the console even exists.</p><p>Furukawa added that in 2021 and 2022's financial years, Nintendo was unable to meet demand for the Switch, mentioning the shortage of semiconductor parts, but says that this situation has been “resolved.” It’s Furukawa’s belief that there shouldn’t be any shortages of any parts this time out, and—according to a Google translation—says the company is also “considering whether we can take any measures within the scope of laws and regulations, taking into account the circumstances of each region.”</p><p>In the same call, Furukawa was also asked how Nintendo would support indie developers with the new system, to which the president said Nintendo has been improving development tools, and improving support for developers, while mentioning the regular Indie World strand of its Direct streams. Rather splendidly he added, “Indie games are essential to increasing the appeal of our platform, so we would like to continue to strengthen these activities in future.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data platform SteamDB</a>, the Steam user count reached 36,928,521 yesterday, which represents a new all-time peak.

<p>This breaks the record set by Steam users back in March, when the total concurrent user count reached 36,354,393, representing a leap of almost three million over the previous month. Perhaps not coincidentally, March is also when the last major Steam sale took place.</p>

Ruiz, playing as General Shao, had just stomped Curtis “Rewind” McCall’s Reiko to send his opponent down into the Losers Bracket.

<p>Despite the overwhelming reception to the game, along with its free-to-play nature and launch this summer for everyone, there’s still mystery surrounding The First Descendant. For instance, what’s the game’s multiplayer like? Is The First Descendant multiplayer?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-the-first-descendant-multiplayer">Can You Play The First Descendant Multiplayer?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, The First Descendant is a cooperative looter-shooter in which up to four players can team up and work together to dominate mobs of enemies and challenge bosses in Void Intercept battles. Alongside the raid-type boss content in The First Descendant, you may also participate in Consecutive Survival and Consecutive Defense, in which you must work together to survive hordes of enemies for as long as possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly for most players, is that you can play the entire campaign cooperatively with the same number of players. You never have to struggle through a particularly challenging section of the game, as you can enlist the help of a friend!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-first-descendant-pvp">Is The First Descendant PvP?</h2>



<p>The First Descendant does not offer a PvP mode, as the game primarily focuses on a cooperative experience. This information was confirmed by developers Beomjun Lee and Minseok Joo, the Producer and Director, respectively, at Nexon Games. They set out to create a cooperative PvE game, first and foremost, and intend to stick with that design plan.</p>



<p>Furthermore, their insistence on sticking to the original PvE plan means there’s little to no chance of a PvP mode coming to The First Descendant in the future. Of course, never say never, but it isn’t very likely.</p>

While using the PC mod, players are no longer booted back to their own game world upon death or the defeat of an area boss, and the restrictions to party movement imposed during vanilla co-op sessions are removed altogether allowing for easy exploration of the open world.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The addition of unfettered co-op makes Elden Ring’s ordinarily uncompromising difficulty a whole lot more manageable, and so the announcement that the mod is functional once more will come as welcome news to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-too-difficult?_gl=1*17thb3y*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzU0MDExNzEyLjE3MTk4MzYzMTg.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTgzNjMxOC4xLjAuMTcxOTgzNjMxOC4wLjAuMA..">those struggling with the challenge posed by Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.</p><p>Prior to Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, FromSoftware president Hidetake Miyazaki revealed he had no issues with players using the seamless co-op mod to make the studios’ games more approachable. Going one step further, he said that the developer <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-may-consider-beginning-to-end-total-co-op-in-future-fromsoftware-games?_gl=1*16845nr*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTAwOTMzMzE5LjE3MTk4MzI5NDk.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTgzMjk0OC4xLjAuMTcxOTgzMjk0OC4wLjAuMA..">may even consider implementing “beginning to end, total co-op” officially in future FromSoftware titles</a>.</p><p>As of the time of writing the Seamless Co-op mod is sitting on a staggering 1.8 million unique downloads and counting, making it the most popular unofficial Elden Ring addon by far. The mod also now allows other players to join the host player's game as an "evil spirit" using a special item, in lieu of the invasion system used in the vanilla game. Players will be unable to rest at sites of grace, or fast travel to them until they have killed the spirit. However, the mod’s author has warned that his creation is in an extended beta state, and will require testing following Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, with players “very likely” to experience bugs while using the mod.</p><p>Those looking to explore Elden Ring’s new content should check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring?_gl=1*17thb3y*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzU0MDExNzEyLjE3MTk4MzYzMTg.*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxOTgzNjMxOC4xLjAuMTcxOTgzNjMxOC4wLjAuMA..">IGN’s extensive guides and interactive maps</a> to ensure that their tarnished is equipped with the weapons and knowledge needed to overcome Shadow of the Erdtree’s fearsome cast of bosses.</p><p><em>Anthony is a freelance contributor covering science and video gaming news for IGN.

        <p>Animation production studio previously worked on Dragon's Dogma 2 and Resident Evil Village</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Capcom has made Minimum Studios a subsidiary through a share acquisition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-fan-film-the-keepers-diary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>fans have created a short film based on one of the original game's most iconic diary-style text logs, and it stars an actor who made an appearance in the original game.</p>
<p><em>The Keeper's Diary: A Biohazard Story&nbsp;</em>stars Charlie Kraslavsky, who played Chris Redfield in the original 1996&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, as The Keeper, a man who slowly succumbs to the zombification process brought on by T-virus exposure.</p>
<p>The film dramatizes the events of the diary, which begin with the Keeper playing poker with his coworkers and famously end with the words "Itchy. Tasty.", which the movie shows him writing as the last vestiges of humanity leave him.</p>

<p>I'd definitely recommend giving this one a watch if you're a&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>fan. The Keeper's Diary is one of the most iconic and well-remembered text logs in the original game, and it's neat to see it brought to life in this way.</p>
<p>You can check out <i>The Keeper's Diary: A Biohazard Story&nbsp;</i>right here. Make sure you keep watching after the credits for a fun sting that seems to offer a tease for one of production company Biohazard Declassified's future projects.</p>

<p>If you haven't caught up with the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and want to know where the Keeper's Diary came from, you've got two options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>HD remake, which was originally released for GameCube in 2002 and which was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-remastering-remake">remastered for more modern platforms in 2015</a>, is widely available on PC and consoles right now.</p>
<p>You could also go back to the source and check out the 1996&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, which scored a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">nifty GOG re-release</a> last week, with&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3&nbsp;</em>set to follow soon. Will this first entry be next in Capcom's sights for a fully-fledged remake? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24187573/house-dragon-season-2-episode-3-review-alicent-rhaenyra<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wl8KKx">So the Brackens hate the Blackwoods, and the Blackwoods hate the Brackens. It’s been this way for as long as anyone can remember. The start of it all, we are told, is lost in time. Does it matter that the Brackens pledged to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones">Aegon</a> and the Blackwoods to Rhaenyra? Probably not. Violence is cyclical, and the young men from each family arguing at the start of this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> were primed for conflict long before they were born. They’re doomed to a grim death, as are the countless countrymen that will join them, as the inertia of this particular cycle runs its course. </p>
<p id="Ggxpse">The opening vignette of this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> underlines how its characters are no longer the masters of their own destinies. War is easy to slide into and difficult to avoid, as it needs no justification to perpetuate itself. That doesn’t mean they’re willing to accept this, though. Continuing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review">the stages-of-grief metaphor</a> from last week, this week’s episode is about bargaining — culminating in a final conversation between Rhaenyra (Emma D’Arcy) and Alicent (Olivia Cooke) where the two attempt exactly that. With a new status quo that has placed an ocean between them, the relationship that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a> is built on gets precious little screen time, even as it still drives their individual convictions. Once upon a time, these young women’s friendship had the potential to break the cycles set in course by men; now that potential is imperiled. Is there any way out? </p>
<p id="GHCrGD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183307/house-dragon-twin-fight-episode-2">As the twins Arryk and Erryk are buried</a>, Rhaenys reminds Rhaenyra that she is not above getting lost in this cycle. She asks what caused the current conflict Westeros finds itself in. Was it the stolen throne? Or Lucerys’ death? Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182584/house-dragon-aemond-daemon-interview-episode-2">Aemond</a>’s lost eye? When the fight begins, will it even matter? “When the desire to kill and burn takes hold,” Rhaenys says, “all reason is forgotten.”</p>

<p id="WlCmtc">Or, as Ser Simon Strong, the castellan of Harrenhal, tells Daemon when he arrives to claim the very damp, hilariously uncontested stronghold: “Sin begets sin begets sin.”</p>
<p id="9NOBHv">Rhaenyra was supposed to be different. Her crown was taken from her <em>because</em> she would have been different, because she would have broken the chain of patriarchal rule and threatened the very power structure of Westeros. Thus, she makes one final, desperate gambit to break the loop, to pivot away from the war that the men of this world crave, the same kind of war they have waged for generations. She sneaks into King’s Landing to meet with Alicent during her prayers.</p>
<p id="IkCeBZ">It’s a patently absurd mission, one that the viewer — who has just witnessed the dysfunction of Rhaenyra’s council, the bloodthirst of Aegon’s response, and Ser Simon Strong’s frank breakdown of the conflict that has forever spilled across the riverlands — would be right to be skeptical of. But perhaps a dream deserves a funeral, and Rhaenyra needs one last chance to mourn, reckless as it may be. </p>

<p id="4UaNl7">“We knew even [as children] that men trained for battle are eager to fight,” she tells Alicent, believing that they can still be different, that they can find peace. Alicent, however, still believes herself to be in the right, that Viserys changed his mind about his heir on his deathbed, and that it’s Rhaenyra’s actions that are plunging them into war. The conversation devolves into blame and deflection until the core misunderstanding that drove the pair apart is finally clarified: Alicent realizes King Viserys’ last words were about Aegon the Conqueror, and not his grandson Aegon. </p>
<p id="VK2D7g">Olivia Cooke plays the terrible moment of realization impeccably, as shock and comprehension make their way across her face before curdling into grim determination. They’re already pot committed; there’s nothing to be done. They too will slip into the tides of war, but unlike many of the men we saw before, they will know exactly why.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 offers such an extraordinary and exciting premise, with its four-player cooperative gameplay and hordes of enemies. It’s the perfect starting point for some of our favorite science-fiction franchises, like Star Wars. Here is where to download the Helldivers 2 Star Wars mod!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-download-a-helldivers-2-automaton-replacer-mod">Where to Download a Helldivers 2 Automaton Replacer Mod</h2>



<p>Helldivers 2’s Automaton faction is ripe with possibilities. They’re killer robots from outer space, sent to harvest a planet’s resources and stop humanity. But as robots, they’re almost faceless villains—the perfect starting point for a user-made mod. In steps the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Wars Enemies (Automaton Replacers)</a> mod, which does precisely that. It swaps out the usual Automatons for:</p>



<ul>
<li>B1 Battle Droids</li>



<li>B2 Battle Droids</li>



<li>Commando Droids</li>



<li>Armored Assault Tanks</li>



<li>DT Series Sentry Droid</li>



<li>Droideka</li>



<li>Dwarf Spider Droids</li>



<li>HMP Droid Gunships</li>



<li>OG-9 Homing Spider Droid</li>



<li>AT-RT</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-get-the-helldivers-2-clone-trooper-mod">Where to Get the Helldivers 2 Clone Trooper Mod</h2>



<p>Fighting Droids is really cool and all, but what if you were to step into the boots of a Clone Trooper while doing so? That’s even better, right?</p>



<p>Well, there’s a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clone Trooper (Phase 2 – 501st Legion)</a> mod available that swaps out the character models of the typical Helldivers for the iconic frontline soldiers from Star Wars!</p>



<p>It’s a purely cosmetic replacer—completely client-side—but use any of the available Star Wars mods for Helldivers 2 at your own risk. No one has yet been banned from using cosmetic mods, but it could happen in the future!</p>



<h2 id="h-other-star-wars-mods-for-helldivers-2">Other Star Wars Mods for Helldivers 2</h2>



<p>Alongside user-made mods to swap out the Automatons and the Helldivers themselves with Clone Troopers, you’ll find a bunch of sweet Star Wars mods for Helldivers 2, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Star Wars Ships</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/helldivers2/mods/50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Din Djarin (The Mandalorian)</a></li>
