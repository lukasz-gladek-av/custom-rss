            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is making kids’ online safety a cornerstone of her administration, and she’s eyeing a platform that has often flown under the radar: Roblox.</p><p>As progress in Congress has stagnated, states have become the primary drivers of internet reforms meant to protect kids, including age verification laws and new requirements for online platforms. Hochul announced a <a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/protecting-our-kids-governor-hochul-announces-nation-leading-proposals-protect-kids-online">sweeping plan</a> to expand online parental controls and age verification, which she’ll tout at her State of the State on Tuesday. It notably pulls from a piece of legislation crafted by state Sen. Andrew Gounardes and Assemblymember Nily Rozic meant to plug a gap in earlier state legislation in order to encompass online gaming. Gounardes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">told <em>The Verge</em></a> in a 2024 interview when he first introduced the legislation as the New York Children’s Online Safety Act (NYCOSA) — now the Stop Online Predators Act — that the idea came from parents who wondered whether his earlier kids safety legislation would cover Roblox, the social gaming platform that is extremely popular with children.</p><p>Drawing from the bill, Hochul’s plans include expanding requirements for platforms to verify their users’ ages to include online gaming platforms like Roblox. She also wants platforms to keep kids’ accounts on the highest privacy settings by default so that they can’t be seen or contacted by unknown accounts, and to disable AI chatbot features for kids. The plan also includes requirements for parents to be able to limit financial transactions on their kids’ accounts.</p><div><p>“There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different”</p></div><p>New York state leaders don’t want Roblox, for which more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">40 percent of users are reportedly under age 13</a>, to be left out of new protections. “From toys to food to cars, we regulate all sorts of products to keep children safe. There’s no reason platforms like Roblox should be different,” Gounardes said in a statement ahead of the State of the State. “Online platforms like Roblox are enabling unsafe environments for children, including allowing predators to send explicit messages to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “We urgently need to pass crucial online safety protections to stop predators from exploiting children and create safer online environments for children to play.”</p><p>Roblox did not immediately provide comment on the State of the State proposal, but Roblox spokesperson Eric Porterfield told <em>The Verge</em> after Gounardes unveiled the legislation in 2024 that the company is a “COPPA compliant gaming platform that is designed for all ages,” referring to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). Porterfield said Roblox has “gone beyond COPPA-compliance and built safety tools and systems that address the unique needs of children and do not support photo uploads or other features specific to social media platforms.” The company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/856696/roblox-age-check-estimation-chat">since rolled out</a> new requirements for users to undergo a facial scan to estimate their age in order to access its chat features.</p><div><p>States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections</p></div><p>The kids online safety proposals were the first of the State of the State plans that Hochul previewed last week, underscoring how important an issue that internet safeguards for kids has become in states like New York. States have been at the forefront of such discussions as Congress has largely failed to pass new protections since the 1990s. The proposals come alongside offline actions to address kids’ mental health, including expanded mental health clinics in schools, and an advisory board that includes 11-to-17-year-olds to inform youth mental health policy. They build on earlier legislation passed in New York state, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24182396/new-york-governor-social-media-law-parental-consent-algorithms">Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) For Kids Act</a>, which requires social media companies to obtain parental consent for using “addictive feeds” on kids.</p><p>But some of the proposals, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/column/859351/age-verification-app-stores">age verification</a>, come with their own risks that opponents ranging from industry players to civil liberties groups oppose on the grounds that they could require more data collection, and potentially chill adults’ speech online. The Supreme Court recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/internet-censorship/686042/supreme-court-fsc-paxton-porn-age-verification-ruling">opened the door</a> to some age verification of porn sites, breaking from earlier decisions, but age-gating platforms that host a wide variety of speech raises even thornier questions. Courts across the country have struck down a variety of laws seeking to impose age verification at the platform and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/849752/texas-app-store-accountability-act-age-verification-injunction">app store level</a>, raising questions of constitutionality under the First Amendment. But states have continued to try to enact different kinds of age verification laws nonetheless, creating the potential for a fractured landscape state to state should some courts eventually uphold them.</p><p>Still, many advocates for more online safeguards are praising Hochul’s plans. “The online games kids play and the social media platforms they use for hours and hours a day have become veritable hunting grounds for predators,” Common Sense Media CEO Jim Steyer said in a statement. “Kids and teens need these new protections now more than ever.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MjI4"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lauren Feiner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/policy/860727/new-york-governor-hochul-roblox-kids-online-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>By now, I hope I’ve made it abundantly clear that I’m an anime fan <a href="https://aftermath.site/coming-of-age-anime-call-of-the-night-vampires/"><u>born to slice-of-life romance</u></a>, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/solo-leveling-impressions-anime/"><u>condemned to a lifetime of battle shonen exposure.</u></a> So when I learned that a friend gifted another friend of mine a romance manga I’d only vaguely heard of over the holidays, I treated it like homework I actually wanted to do. I binged the entire thing in a week. Naturally, when the three of us finally met up this past weekend, my friend sheepishly admitted they hadn’t even cracked the spine yet. Which means the burden now falls to you, dear reader, to hear why <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> has quietly become one of my favorite recent romance reads, thanks to how effortlessly cozy it is.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://squareenixmangaandbooks.square-enix-games.com/product/9781646092864?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</u></em></a>, by mangaka <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jinushi</u></a>, is an office workspace rom-com tailor-made for anyone weak to kinda mean goth women who’d step on you and the oddly endearing charm of exhausted, gravely-voiced middle-aged men. It’s a bisexual harvest if ever there was one, and a rare adult romance with an unproblematic age gap.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woclqV1wINo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」メインキャストボイスPV"></iframe></figure><p>Like “<a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-06-04/rockin-out-with-sumiko-arai-the-guy-she-was-interested-in-wasnt-a-guy-at-all-manga-creator/.223419?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Green Yuri</u></a>” (AKA <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><em><u>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</u></em></a>) <em>Smoking Behind The Supermarket With You</em>, found its <a href="https://thetv.jp/news/detail/1084476/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>humble beginnings as a manga series published on Twitter</u></a> in the wake of the pandemic before getting picked up by Square Enix as a serial. It’s not only the first serialized series from Jinushi, but it’s also one that’s got <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-09-21/smoking-behind-the-supermarket-with-you-tv-anime-reveals-main-cast/.229036?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an anime adaptation in the wings</u></a> in 2026. So allow me to yap about why the romance manga is heat so you can say “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xG4oFny2Pk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>but I was there!</u></a>” too.</p><figure><blockquote>— TVアニメ「スーパーの裏でヤニ吸うふたり」公式 (@yanisuu_anime) <a href="https://twitter.com/yanisuu_anime/status/1946132855618502947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>From the jump, I was immediately arrested by how <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You </em>wastes no time resonating with anyone trapped in the corporate grind, clinging to the tiny rituals that make the day-to-day survivable as the series’ thematic anchor. Be that stopping by a convenience store, catching the warm smile of a store clerk who unknowingly gave you just enough serotonin to make that bread, or just grab some smokes and take the edge off from a hard day's work.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the cadence of Sasaki’s life. Sasaki is a middle-aged, overworked salaryman who after getting berated by his boss, concludes each day at&nbsp; The series, on the whole, strikes a chord with anyone who deals with the corporate grind and finds solace in frequenting a haunt only to be graced by the beaming smile of a store clerk that gives you a boost in happy brain chemicals to continue waking up and making that bread. Or, at least doing so until you need to grab a smoke to take the edge off. That’s the case with Sasaki, a middle-aged, overworked salaryman who ends each day at a convenience store not just to grab groceries, but to bask in the bright, grounding presence of a cute clerk named Yamada.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>That is, until the rhythm of his day is thrown off one night when he swings by the store late and discovers Yamada has already clocked out. Instead, he’s greeted by a leather-jacketed, pierced woman named Tayama, who casually invites him out back to share a smoke and some company. Because Sasaki is, frankly, severely face-blind in the most endearing way, he never clocks that Tayama—whom he assumes is some coworker he’s somehow overlooked for months—is actually Yamada without the uniform, <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1829923640743444748?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">customer-service smile</a>, or the practiced bubbly disposition she uses on the clock.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/LS6xTacYqF?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/LS6xTacYqF</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1977692567988060316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>What follows is a wonderfully lopsided pseudo-love triangle in which “Tayama” (and the rest of the store staff, fully aware of the comedy of errors unfolding) gently teases Sasaki for his obvious crush on her other self. Meanwhile, Sasaki, thrilled to finally have a smoking buddy, finds himself falling for the woman behind the polite platitudes. On paper, <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of wacky setup you’d only find in a gag manga or an early-aughts rom-com—the sort of <em>Miss Congeniality</em>, <em>Princess Diaries</em> bit where a change of clothes and vernacular somehow renders a person unrecognizable. And the whole Yamada/Tayama dual identity asks for a level of suspension of disbelief from the reader that practically nudges the series into sketch comedy territory. But what makes the manga sing is that, <a href="https://youtu.be/RSOrscuIFC4?list=TLPQMTIwMTIwMjY3M6WWk_hqFw&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>beneath its deeply silly premise</u></a>, it harbors a romance that could only work between adults.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/7slP9xWlTC?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/7slP9xWlTC</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1897839463834976469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>A huge part of that comes down to smoking itself. As a habit, smoking is both a self-destructive vice and a symbolic pressure valve to let off some steam. But between smokers, it becomes something more intimate: a quiet ritual of shared air, time, and vulnerability so addictive that you’d jump at the offer regardless of how chilly it is outside. Simply put, it’s a sophisticated, mature mode of connection that simply doesn’t exist in garden-variety romances. For the non-smokers of the world, it’s the equivalent of loading up a YouTube video on someone else’s account or sending them a song that’s been haunting your brain—forever altering the other person’s algorithm. Folding your tiny, private time-waster into someone else’s life in a way that feels strangely tender. “Intimacy in the modern day,” as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theofficialnorthernlion/video/7575988525087214866?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7494297314892203551&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitch streamer Northernlion</u></a> puts it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Square Enix</span></figcaption></figure><p>Swap out playlists for preferred cigarette brand flavors, fireside chats, and easy shared silences that stretch as long as you let them, and you get something even more specific and profound as the bedrock of a romance. It’s here that <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> takes its cozy premise and leans into how something as ordinary as sharing a smoke with a friend can spark a kind of honesty and intimacy that hits harder than an indirect kiss over a shared drink. The small rituals between Sasaki and Tayama—the teasing, the quiet moments, the unspoken warmth—never overstay their welcome. Instead, each chapter offers another faint glow of their ember‑warm yearning, slowly shifting from easygoing companionship into something unmistakably romantic.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">３すう。 <a href="https://t.co/ZJj22t03lE?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/ZJj22t03lE</a></p>— 地主⬛︎新刊1/23 (@jinusi822) <a href="https://twitter.com/jinusi822/status/1898637057540407566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">March 9, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The flames of that yearning are certainly aided by <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1884197016353599641?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Jinushi’s online illustrations </a>of the two fulfilling <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1983550204868710535?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">nurse‑and‑patient cosplay</a> and <a href="https://x.com/jinusi822/status/1819346049754099821?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">other cheeky fantasies</a>. But the real magic lies in the series' quieter, less showy moments of wish fulfillment, threaded through the manga. The simple, disarming intimacy of being understood. <em>Smoking Behind the Supermarket With You</em> is the kind of romance where letting the long fuse of this oddball relationship burn at its own pace is part of the delight. After all, you can’t appreciate a cigarette if you inhale it all in one hungry pull. Beneath the disguises and crossed signals, they’re just two people who genuinely like being in each other’s orbit—and who would quietly ache at the thought of losing the small, daily comfort of talking through the weight of their days or shooting the breeze about nothing at all.&nbsp; </p>

			<p><strong>Hytale</strong>, the long-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-minecraft-like-mmo-resurrected-will-launch-early-access-soon/">Minecraft-like game that was recently resurrected</a> by its original creator, <strong>Simon Collins-Laflamme</strong>, and is now due to be out tomorrow on<a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-early-access-release-date-january-2026/"> <strong>January 13, 2026</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has just hit another milestone in its incredible comeback story, as Collins-Laflamme announces that the development costs for <strong>Hypixel Studios</strong> as it builds Hytale in early access have been fully funded for the next two years based on <strong>pre-order sales alone.</strong></p>



<p>The game isn't even out yet in early access, but the community that has built around it since work on the game first started in 2015, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-just-acquired-hytale-developer-hypixel-studios/"> stayed with it after it was acquired by <strong>Riot</strong></a>, only to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hytale-is-officially-dead-and-its-studio-disbanded/">shuttered by Riot and the team disbanded</a>, and then revived within the last few months have shown that they are very excited for Hytale to finally be here.</p>



<p>"<em>Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases</em>," Collins-Laflamme wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). "<em>Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future. Thank you for all the support. <strong>Hytale is saved.</strong> We are almost home.</em>"</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Minecraft-like MMO has been a long time coming, and tomorrow's early access launch not only represents a new chapter for the game and the studio but also an incredible accomplishment for the team to be able to get it out of Riot's hands and across the finish line for release.</p>



<p>Of course, a whole new challenge begins once it is live and in players' hands, but at least the team at Hypixel Studios has the chance to see if they're up for that challenge, instead of the game lying dead in a waste basket of Riot-owned IPs, left wondering if they could have ever made something truly great with Hytale.</p>

            <p>
There is a strange deliciousness in experiencing a game from a perspective that it does not otherwise allow. Sure, things don't always look right, there's just this opportunity to rethink how you view a particular world. Recently, it appears that someone playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> got to do just that, by switching it into a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooting</a> mode as opposed to its usual third-person camera, all thanks to an accident.
</p>
<p>
You see, over on the game's subreddit, user Short_Satisfaction_9 (I guess Short_Satisfaction_1-8 was already taken) shared a clip of themself playing the game in first-person using console commands. There's some obvious jank in the clip, you can see through the player-character's face at points which is always yucky, as well as their arms when they're doing some shooty stuff. This, however, is not a thing you are meant to be able to do, and has already been removed by developer Embark.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q89t5e/i_tried_arc_raiders_in_first_person/">I tried arc raiders in first person</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Short_Satisfaction_9/">u/Short_Satisfaction_9</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/">ArcRaiders</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
"We have just pushed a hotfix removing the 'NewConsole' command," community manager Ossen shared in a message in the game's official Discord (ta, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-removes-a-hidden-first-person-exploit-just-1-day-after-it-was-uncovered-this-feature-was-never-meant-to-be-player-facing/">PCGamer</a>). "This feature was never meant to be player-facing. We're continuing to investigate related reports and may take action where appropriate to protect fair play and the integrity of the game."
</p><p>
Just because it exists in one sort of functional form doesn't mean you should expect it at any point in the future, as the devs have already said that it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/dont-count-on-arc-raiders-ever-getting-a-first-person-mode-once-you-start-being-able-to-put-your-face-right-up-against-an-asset-it-kind-of-falls-apart/">extremely unlikely they'll ever add one in</a>. Still! An interesting insight into another world where it is a first-person game, but one you'll have to find an inter-dimensional portal to travel to. Good luck?

              <p>The latest of Steam’s creative weekly sales has just gone live, and this time it’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/detective">Detective Fest</a>. But rather than become entangled in red string as you try to pin all the available games to your enormous pinboard, we’ve inspected the selection through our microscope, whittled down the suspects, and then performed yet another detective cliche, to select the most suspicious(ly good) games for you to interrogate.</p>  <p>Investigative games have become a rather big deal in recent years, with many indie titles having broken through to the mainstream to enormous success. And, so of course, you’ve got the likes of&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Rise of the Golden Idol </em>in the sale, alongside less recent classics like <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> and&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. But you already know about all of those, so where’s the good in my suggesting those? Nope, let’s dive a little deeper with a selection of games that won’t be appearing at the top of all the store’s lists.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3756940/The_Ratline/"><em>The Ratline</em></a></h2>  <p>You know who was making amazing family-tree-like detective games long before&nbsp;<em>The Roottrees Are</em> <em>Dead</em>? <a href="https://owlskip-games.itch.io/">Owlskip</a>. Titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/riley-rochelle-musical-music-pc-steam-sheinman-games-1849676247"><em>Riley &amp; Rochelle</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/07/family/">Family,</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2020/09/rivals/"><em>Rivals</em></a> were years ahead on the format, and definitely deserve to be discovered in light of <em>Roottrees</em>‘ breakout success. Anything else is frankly unfair. <em>The Ratline</em> is the latest from the studio, due out in March, once again asking you to piece together a mystery from an array of clues and documents. This time things are set in 1971 and have you hunt down Nazi fugitives after the murder of a priest, and who doesn’t need a little Nazi hunting just now? There’s a demo out for Detective Fest.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781420/Surradia_An_Art_Retrospective/"><em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em></a></h2>  <p>There’s also a demo for the upcoming <em>Surradia: An Art Retrospective</em>, a detective game about investigating the disappearance of three magical artists who vanished during World War II. That means scouring photographs, reading letters, and of course paying close attention to artworks, all found in a museum, as you try to unpick the mystery. There’s no official release date for the game yet, but the demo’s here right now.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618570/The_Detectives_Apprentice/"><em>The Detective’s Apprentice</em></a></h2>  <p>This is a tremendous trailer! You’re Cleo, working for world-renowned detective Maya Lynch, learning the ropes in this unbelievably lovely-looking game. There’s a demo out for Detective Fest, which features Cleo’s first three cases, with the full game due later.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3627210/Mansion_of_a_Million_Monsters/">Mansion of a Million Monsters</a></em></h2>  <p><em>Mansion of a Million Monsters</em> takes a decidedly different approach to the detective genre, combining its investigative ways with dungeon-crawling action. It has the vibes of one of those classic Amiga games that everyone still raves about today. The developers say they’ll hopefully have a demo up for this one in the next day or so.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060960/Sleuth_Saga_Under_Starless_Skies/"><em>Sleuth Saga: Under Starless Skies</em></a></h2>  <p>This detective sim is based on all the right names, like&nbsp;<em>Phoenix Wright</em> and&nbsp;<em><i>Danganronpa</i></em>. Set in the year 780 Quattuoris 32nd (which I&nbsp;<em>cannot</em> find on my calendar), this is the tale of the daughter of investigative journalist Frederick Emery. Her father is found dead, a staged suicide, and she sets out to disprove the police’s claims. It’s to be five episodes long, with the first now playable via a free demo. Also, later this week developers Arboreal Interactive hopes to update with&nbsp;<em>another</em> free chapter, Chapter 0.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3485220/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Murder_Otaku/"><em>Murder Is Game Over: Murder Otaku</em></a></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Murder Is Game Over</em> series of pixel point-n-clickers started in 2022, and&nbsp;<em>Murder Otaku</em> is already the fourth! It came out toward the end of last year, and if you click with its tale of solving the murder of a J-pop singer at an anime convention, that means you’ve now got another three games that are sure things. You can pick up the whole lot in the Cleo’s Complete Casefile bundle, on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/33733/Murder_Is_Game_Over_Cleos_Complete_Casefile/">Steam</a> or <a href="https://hitheryongames.itch.io/murder-is-game-over-cleos-complete-casefile">Itch</a>.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2739630/of_the_Devil/"><em>of the Devil</em></a></h2>  <p><em>of the Devil </em>is a six-part episodic detective game inspired by the likes of <em>Ace Attorney</em> and <em>Danganronpa</em>. Its first free episode was released last year, and two more paid episodes have already been released since then! The game, which features amazing art, is set in the cyberpunk future of 2086 and has you playing a criminal defense attorney. So yeah, grab the first episode for nothing, and then see if you want to pick up the next two, with releases seeming to come nice and quickly.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2131660/Call_of_the_Golden_Valley/"><em>Call of the Golden Valley</em></a></h2>  <p>Australian detective sim&nbsp;<em>Call of the Golden Valley</em> came out last October and still offers a free demo. You play Danielle, an American tourist who arrives in the country to visit a friend, Marisa, only to find she’s gone missing. So you begin investigating the small town, piecing together evidence, and finding out why Golden Valley is the sight of so many disappearing hikers.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919600/Paper_Perjury/"><em>Paper Perjury</em></a></h2>  <p>Another game you can play right now,&nbsp;<em>Paper Perjury</em> is a visual novel series from Paper Cat Games where new Azure City Police Department clerk Justina Smith begins investigating some peculiar crimes. Case 1 of the game is available as a free demo, and a sixth case is due to be added pretty soon.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2689930/Detective_Instinct_Farewell_My_Beloved/"><em>Detective Instinct: Farewell, My Beloved</em></a></h2>  <p>A few of the games mentioned above were inspired to some degree by <em>Phoenix Wright</em>, but few wear it on their sleeve so much as&nbsp;<em>Detective Instinct</em>. It looks like it could have come from Capcom, and this is high praise. The mystery adventure is all about trying to track down a woman who disappears from a train, only no one on board but you can remember her. It came out late last year, and is celebrating Detective Fest with a discount and a free demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Masters of Albion, the new game from long-time developer Peter Molyneux has a release date. On Monday, developer 22cans announced that the game is set to launch on April 22.</p>



<p>The game will be available exclusively on PC via Steam.</p>







<h2 id="h-masters-of-albion-is-a-reimagining">Masters of Albion Is A “Reimagining”</h2>



<p>First revealed at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a>, Masters of Albion is a <strong>“bold reimagining of the God Game genre.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Mixing strategy with simulation, town management and tower defence, the game takes you into the rich narrative world of Albion,</strong>” the game’s description says. <strong>“Starting in the undeveloped village of Oakridge, players will step into the body of a god, controlling the town and its citizens, building a small business and completing orders for various customers.”</strong></p>







<p>As mentioned, the game comes from Peter Molyneaux, the man credited with creating the Fable franchise, The Movies, Populous, and many more. Back when it was announced, the 66-year-old Molyneux mentioned that Masters of Albion was likely to be his last game because of his age.</p>



<p>In a release announcing the release date, Molyneux said that the new game owes a lot to his prior titles.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>“Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable,”</strong> he said. <strong>“It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Six and a half years ago—after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/01/gamestop-calls-off-its-search-for-a-buyer-sees-a-one-day-stock-dive-of-27/">a failed corporate sale attempt</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gamestop-posts-massive-loss-as-pre-owned-game-sales-plummet/">massive financial losses</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/management-reshuffle-at-gamestop">the departure</a>/<a href="https://x.com/ModernVintageG/status/1156658352874827776/photo/1">layoff</a> of many key staff—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/why-some-of-us-will-miss-gamestop-when-its-gone/">I wrote about</a> what seemed at the time like the “imminent demise” of GameStop. Now, after five years of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/the-complete-morons-guide-to-gamestops-stock-roller-coaster/">meme stock mania</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/gamestop-stock-falls-sharply-amid-5m-share-sales-plan-sec-investigation/">helped prop up the company’s finances a bit</a>, I’ll admit the video game <a href="https://x.com/OPMerchandise/status/2009627597915717797">and Funko Pop</a> retailer has lasted much longer as a relevant entity than I anticipated.</p>
<p>GameStop’s surprisingly extended run may be coming to an end, though, with Polygon reporting late last week that GameStop <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gamestop-retail-store-closures-2026/">has abruptly shut down 400 stores</a> across the US, with even more closures expected before the end of the month. That comes on top of 590 US stores that were shuttered in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January 2025) and stated plans to close hundreds of remaining international stores across Canada, Australia, and Europe in the coming months, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm">per SEC filings</a>.</p>
<p>GameStop still had just over 3,200 stores worldwide as of February 1, 2025, so even hundreds of new and planned store closures don’t literally mean the immediate end of the company as a going concern. But when you consider that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/gamestop-plans-up-to-200-store-closures-expects-many-more-on-the-way/">there were still nearly 6,000 GameStop locations worldwide as of 2019</a>—nearly 4,000 of which were in the US—the long-term trend is clear.</p>
<h2>The ghost of Tower Records appears in a vision</h2>
<p>The reason for that downward trend has been equally clear for years now: downloadable games. We made note back in 2017 when <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/for-console-games-downloads-are-approaching-a-tipping-point/">more than half of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s game sales came via download rather than disc</a>, and things have only accelerated from there. Physical game sales <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">now represent just 3 percent of overall PlayStation revenue</a>, for instance, compared to 20 percent for digital full-game software sales, 17 percent for subscription-based “network services” like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/06/sonys-new-playstation-plus-launches-in-us-with-over-800-games/">PlayStation Plus</a>, and 29 percent for digital “add-on content” like DLC. Some major games are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">skipping physical releases altogether</a> these days, while Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-begrudging-defense-of-nintendos-game-key-cards-for-the-switch-2/">selling data-free Switch 2 Game Key Cards</a> that merely act as a key for a downloadable copy of the game.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/masters-of-albion-release-date-22-cans-peter-molyneux/</link>
            <guid>1403752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Veteran game developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/peter-molyneux-says-ai-will-be-a-real-game-changer-in-the-future-of-games/">Peter Molyneux</a></strong> made himself a household name as the man credited as the creator of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playground-fable-rumored-launch-day-date-ps5-forza-horizon-6-wont-wasnt-ready/">Fable</a></strong> series, is getting set to release his next and potentially final project with <strong>Masters of Albion</strong>, a new god game from his studio 22cans. Molyneux calls the game "<em>the culmination of my life's work</em>," as he and 22cans announce its release date has been set for <strong>April 22, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>It'll arrive exclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/">PC through Steam</a>, and 22cans debuted a new trailer for the game today, taking players through a bit of what they can expect from Masters of Albion and showing off plenty of gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Masters of Albion - Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HU0lXuKwB64?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beyond Fable, you'd recognize Molyneux's name from the likes of Populous, Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and perhaps more infamously from the controversial title, Godus. Beyond Molyneux, several other iconic names, all of whom have worked with Molyneux before, worked on Masters of Albion, including BAFTA-winning game developers and artists Russell Shaw, Mark Healey, Iain Wright, and Kareem Ettouney.</p>



<p>"<em>Masters of Albion is the culmination of my life's work,</em>" said Molyneux as part of the game's release date announcement. "<em>A game that owes so much to titles like Dungeon Keeper, Black &amp; White, and Fable. It's a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map</em>."</p>



<p>Molyneux's name may be attached to some of gaming's best titles, but he made himself more infamously known after being branded as <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-never-been-seen-mechanic-peter-molyneux-new-project-hype/">someone who over-hypes projects</a> following Godus and Curiosity: What's Inside the Cube?. It's what makes it difficult to get too excited about Masters of Albion, even if today's trailer makes it seem like it will be a fun and creative experience for players.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, we'll see how Molyneux fares in his next, and potentially final, outing as a game developer. Masters of Albion could be his retirement swansong, or the game that brings a poor and lasting stain at the end of his career.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Paramount Sues Warner Bros. Over Netflix Deal]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-sues-warner-bros-over-netflix-deal/</link>
            <guid>1403743</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Paramount continues to put up a fight over the pending sale of Warner Bros. to Netflix. On Wednesday, the company announced it was suing Warner Bros. in a continuation of its attempt at a hostile takeover of the company.</p>



<p>The lawsuit comes just days after Paramount’s latest bid was rejected, again, by Warner Bros. Discover.</p>







<p>According to the lawsuit, Paramount claims that the Warner Bros. Discovery board misled shareholders and concealed financial analysis. In a <a href="https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-provides-update-warner-bros-discovery-shareholders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders</a> announcing the suit, Paramount CEO David Ellison said that the company has <strong>“failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its “risk adjustment” of our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer.”</strong></p>



<p>He continued, saying that shareholders need that information to <strong>“make an informed investment decision on our offer.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-why-paramount-is-fighting-for-warner-bros">Why Paramount Is Fighting For Warner Bros?</h2>



<p>On December 5, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was announced that Netflix and Warner Bros. Discover</a> were in an agreement to sell the Warner Bros. side of the company to the streaming giant as part of an $82.7 billion deal. The sale would include only the company’s streaming and studios assets, including all of Warner Bros. Games. </p>



<p>Netflix’s offer of $27.75 per share doesn’t include the cable channels. Paramount’s offer of $30 would be for ethe entirety of the company. That would put the value of the cable networks at just $2.25 per share if the value of the streaming and studio assets remained the same as the Netflix deal. </p>



<p>Since the agreement was announced, Paramount has continued to try and force a sale to them. Leading up to and after the announcement of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery has rejected at least eight Paramount offers. </p>







<p>The Warner Bros. Discovery board has said that Paramount would need to offer more cash and less debt for it to be reconsidered.</p>



<p>As far as why Paramount would want Warner Bros., it’s a pretty obvious. Video Games aside, which even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-downplays-value-wb-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix called “minor”</a> in terms of the deal, includes rights to a number of brands and IPs such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“Our objective from the moment we approached WBD was for a collaborative negotiation and a successful transaction that would be a win for both companies, both shareholder groups and all stakeholders,”</strong> Ellison wrote. <strong>“We remain perplexed that WBD never responded to our&nbsp;December 4th&nbsp;offer, never attempted to clarify or negotiate any of the terms in that proposal, nor traded markups of contracts with us.&nbsp; </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Even as we read WBD’s own narrative of its process, we are struck that there were few actual board meetings in the period leading up to the decision to accept an inferior transaction with Netflix. And we are surprised by the lack of transparency on WBD’s part regarding basic financial matters. It just doesn’t add up – much like the math on how WBD continues to favor taking less than our&nbsp;$30 per share all-cash offer for its shareholders.”</strong></p>



<p>Both Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery have declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>

After developer Hypixel Studios was acquired by Riot Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223667/riot-games-league-of-legends-hypixel-studios-minecraft-hytale">in 2020</a>, shut down by Riot <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/691791/riot-games-hypixel-studios-hytale-closure">in June 2025</a>, and went independent <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">a few months later</a>, the team is launching <em>Hytale</em> in early access on January 13th.</p><p>And if you jump in at launch, you can expect updates for years to come — which could be reassuring if you felt burned by other ambitious but quickly shuttered games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604179/multiversus-final-season-shutdown"><em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios"><em>Concord</em></a>. “We have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases,” <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614">according to</a> Hypixel cofounder Simon Collins-Laflamme, who has also made a “personal commitment” of 10 years to the project.</p><p>“<em>Hytale</em> blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block,” <a href="https://hytale.com/game">according to Hypixel</a>. “Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems - exploration, responsive combat, and robust building - alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.”</p><p>The initial launch will be “true early access,” Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026">said in November</a>, “meaning it’s still very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while, but you have my and the team’s commitment to make <em>Hytale</em> the game we’ve always wanted it to be.”</p><p>Hypixel expects “over 1 million players” on <em>Hytale’s</em> early access release day, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010458001455640636">Collins-Laflamme says</a>. It will be <a href="https://store.hytale.com/#system-requirements">available on</a> PC, Mac, and Linux <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">starting at</a> $19.99. Hypixel is planning on a console release of the game “at a later stage,” and there won’t be a mobile version during early access, <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">according to an FAQ</a>.</p><p>Riot’s shutdown of Hypixel followed layoffs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">in 2024</a>.

You cannot pet the dog in Dunderbeck, but you can assuredly eat the unicorn. Just drag its corpse over the puckering mouth on the righthand side. Alternatively, you can chuck the dead unicorn into the mincers on the left and combine the resulting horny horsemeat with other sources of... nutrition, such as rainbow-coloured turds and spoons. I do not know what foodstuffs might result. I refuse to play Dunderbeck’s demo. I watched 20 seconds of the trailer, then spent the next ten minutes brushing my teeth. Here you go.

Dunderbeck is an atypically nauseating inventory management autobattler. It puts you in charge of a jovial exterminator, plying the sweaty streets of Cincinnati, Ohio. Dunderbeck walks automatically along the top of the screen, fighting creatures that range from everyday 'pests' to mythical beasts. You, meanwhile, have the pleasure of arranging and processing any items scooped up enroute, so as to keep Dunderbeck fighting fit. 
</p>
<p>
The challenge with such games is generally a mix of timing and spatial reasoning. In this case, you’ll also have to resist the urge to vom. Dunderbeck himself may puke if you feed him anything unholy, but he, at least, can devour his own sick for unspecified benefits - or simply because he's a disgusting shithead. The pitch is that everything can be eaten “at least once”. What’s more, everything can serve as a weapon: just pop it into the clutching hands beneath the gnashing maw on your HUD.
</p><p>
“Your job is to fight that mess, build with that mess and - I'm sorry to say - eat that mess,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477750/Dunderbeck/">the Steam page</a>. “It's a dirty job, but that's how the sausage is made.” The demo includes two of the game’s townships, which range from forest environments to sewers. The full game includes “over 120 recipes, each requiring one of over 120 items”. That’s 120 too many, as far as I’m concerned. Still, I am not your doctor or licensed nutritionist - I cannot reasonably deny you your fill of unicorn rat-atouille. If you enjoy optimising inventories but don't have a taste for rodents, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/backpack-hero">Backpack Hero</a> instead.

                <p>The Sims is no stranger to collaborating with major fashion brands. Back in 2007, developer Maxis partnered up with H&amp;M to bring dozens of real-life clothing items to The Sims 2. In more recent years, both Primark and Moschino have made their way into the series with The Sims 4 Stuff Packs. Now, the American brand Coach is headed to the game in the series' most luxurious collab yet.</p><p>Starting on January 13, The Sims 4 players will gain access to The Coach Collection, a catalog of nine new items inspired by the "wearable staples" and "bold statement pieces" Coach is known for. The Create-A-Sim items coming include the company's Soho sneakers, a varsity jacket, and sleek skirt sets, while Build Mode will receive the heritage trunk and both Tabby and Brooklyn purses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180"></a><figcaption>A look at the upcoming Coach collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png"></figure><p>In addition to these items, The Coach Collection comes with a new family available to move in via The Sims Gallery: The Carriage House. The press release described the family as "three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama." The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the "In The Bag room," which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.</p><p>In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">values are unchanged</a>" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The team also reiterated that it is committed to creating "single-player life simulation experiences" while also teasing upcoming The Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile.</p>

            <p>
We already knew Hytale was likely to have a major early access release this week, but developer Hypixel Studios has now revealed the long-awaited Minecraft-a-like has sold so many copies ahead of its launch that it's made enough money to fund the next two years of development.
</p>
<p>
Development of Hytale, an RPG-like Minecraft-style sandbox experience, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">began in 2015</a>, garnering plenty of attention - with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions into the project before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But last year it seemed like Hytale's adventure might have reached an end after Riot <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">made the decision to pull the plug</a>, forcing Hypixel to announce it would be "winding down" its operations as a result.

<figcaption>Here's an official look at building in Hytale.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NNh6Dz7YpA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Somewhat miraculously, however, Hytale survived; Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced he'd <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year, and the whole dramatic saga appears to have created massively renewed interest in the project. Ahead of Hytale's early access launch on 13th January this week, Collins-Laflamme revealed Hypixel is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">expecting 1m players on release day</a> - and encouraged purchasers to download the game's launcher in advance (Hytale is only available for purchase via the studio's website during early access) to reduce server stress.
</p><p>
Now, Collins-Laflamme has explained what the massive number of pre-purchases means for Hytale's continued development. "Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases," he wrote <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?s=20">on social media</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," he continued, "we are looking very strong for the future." That's clearly encouraging news, both for early adopters and for the studio as it works to fulfil Hytale's early promise.
</p>
<p>
Players wanting to get involved in Hytale's early access have three options, with Hypixel <a href="https://store.hytale.com/">currently selling</a> a $23.99 USD standard edition, a $41.99 Supporter Edition, and an $83.99 Founder's Edition on its site - with the latter two versions including a selection of additional cosmetic outfits and capes.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-the-tower-leaderboards-beta-arrives-update-2-5-2-blizzard/</link>
            <guid>1403689</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Blizzard's</strong> latest update for <strong>Diablo IV</strong>, patch <strong>2.5.2</strong>, is set to go live today at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BT, adding the Tower in the seasonal realm and Leaderboards in a Beta state, with Blizzard introducing them early to give more time for player feedback.</p>



<p>For now, the Beta introduction of the Tower and Leaderboards may be a bit buggy, Blizzard warns, but encourages players to leave their feedback as the team will continue to build out more features for the Tower and Leaderboards in Diablo IV in future updates.</p>



<p>"<em>Tear through the Tower, a fearsome new experience for many players, with a chance to earn a place on the Leaderboards," </em>Blizzard writes in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta">a blog post on today's update</a><em>. "Arriving in Beta with 2.5.2, the Tower and Leaderboards are launching early so we can shape the experience together with your feedback."</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>In the Tower, you’ll battle your way through a series of floors featuring randomized layouts and monster families. Push deeper, race against the clock and unleash your build as you fight toward the final Tower boss to complete your run.</em>"</p>



<p>Only players who have completed Rank 2 of the season rank will be able to access the Tower, so you'll have to get that finished before trying to place your name at the top of the leaderboards, which will be updated in two-week rounds throughout each season. The day before this current season, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-divine-intervetion-lands-on-december-11/">Season of Divine Intervention</a></strong> ends, the leaderboards will close and be locked in, cementing your place in the rankings.</p>



<p>Leaderboards, a new ranking system, and the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lord-of-hatred-expansion-release-date/"><strong>Lord of Hatred</strong></a> expansion were three of the teases included in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">2026 section of the last roadmap Blizzard put out for Diablo IV</a>. Now that we're a dozen days into 2026, and we know that the Lord of Hatred expansion will arrive this coming <strong>April 28, 2026,</strong> we'll hopefully get a clearer idea of what Blizzard has planned for Diablo IV this year soon.</p>



<p>The Lord of Hatred expansion was revealed at<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"> The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, and is the second major expansion coming to Diablo IV after its first expansion, <strong>Vessel of Hatred</strong>, arrived in October 2024. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo reviewed Vessel of Hatred at its launch</a>, he called it "<em>a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come.</em>"</p>



<p>Hopefully, Lord of Hatred is able to improve on Diablo IV in more ways than just systemically, building off the foundation left by Vessel of Hatred.</p>

Molyneux has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/emperor-of-overpromising-peter-molyneux-says-hes-done-with-games-after-masters-of-albion-which-is-also-his-redemption-title/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously described</a> the sim as his "last game", so it's also the controversial industry icon's swansong (assuming this really is his last hurrah, of course).</p><p>Molyneux and 22cans are promising that <em>Masters of Albion </em>will offer a blend of "cozy creativity" during the game's days and "brutal survival" when night falls, which sounds like a pretty typically ambitious combination of genres for <em>Fable </em>and <em>Populous</em>' designer.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Masters of Albion </em>will be Peter Molyneux's final game, it seems.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to 22cans and Molyneux, <em>Masters of Albion </em>is a "bold reimagining" of the god game genre, which Molyneux himself helped to pioneer through efforts like the aforementioned <em>Populous</em>, as well as games like <em>Black &amp; White</em> and <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>.</p><p>It's angling to be a city-builder with a strong narrative element; not only will you be building and developing the town of Oakridge, but you'll also be able to zoom in and see what you've built through the eyes of the people who live there.</p><p>Of course, Molyneux also has a history of overpromising and (some might say) underdelivering; although the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/fable-3-10th-anniversary" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="106de72f-8712-45e2-984c-a0d2b75cd71e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable </em>series is well-loved</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-peter-molyneuxs-godus-is-such-a-disaster-1685539932" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">lessons of <em>Godus</em></a><em> </em>should teach us to approach any of Molyneux's future projects with trepidation.</p><p>That, however, is a reputation Molyneux himself is aware of. He's called <em>Masters of Albion </em>an attempt at "redemption" for him, and that this represents all of his "chips" being put on the table.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-dream-sleep-death-stranding-2-2000658957</link>
            <guid>1403680</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hideo Kojima dropped a new bit of lore over the weekend: the renowned designer has “always” suffered from nightmares. As he </span><a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009914266024100002"><span>wrote</span></a><span> on Twitter, Kojima stumbled upon old dream logs in his phone’s notes while preparing to deliver </span><a href="https://gdconf.com/article/hideo-kojima-heads-to-the-festival-of-gaming-for-gdcs-first-keynote-in-5-years/"><span>the first keynote address in five years</span></a><span> at the upcoming GDC Festival of Gaming 2026.</span></p> <p><span>Suggested to him as a remedy, jotting down his dreams proved to be ineffective in relieving Kojima of his nightmares. However, the notes grant us some insight into the subconscious of one of the most influential game designers of his time, in the form of two snapshots from almost exactly nine years ago. </span><span>If you’ve ever tried to explain your own dreams, you can probably empathize with Kojima’s struggle to articulate the goings-on of his sleeping mindscape. Still, for memos that likely weren’t intended to be seen by others, they paint a surprisingly coherent picture.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2017/1/3 Memo<br>The dreams I have are always strange ones. I’ve never had what you’d call a “good dream.” Or maybe I just don’t remember them. Ok. My first dream of the year. It’s difficult to put a hazy dream into words, but I’ll try to turn it into text. Some foreign filmmakers… <a href="https://t.co/ryN1yleObC">https://t.co/ryN1yleObC</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2009915298602951012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The first log he shares is from January 3, 2017: In this dream, Kojima is invited to a film set where he is bitten in the arm by a flying, furry round creature. When he manages to pry the strange ball-like creature off his arm, it flies backward and morphs into an undisclosed new form. “A creature from outer space?” Kojima writes.&nbsp;</span><span>“An object from the fourth dimension? Whatever ‘it’ is, it keeps changing form in midair and returning again and again.” The film directors then point their cameras at Kojima, wordlessly capturing the struggle, which concludes with the creature transforming into a plastic card that lands in Kojima’s palm. </span><a href="https://x.com/DOrynbayev/status/2010025245919560025"><span>Fanart</span></a><span> has already been made.</span></p>

 <p><span>The second dream log comes from the following day, and takes place in a hot spring town. Kojima moves to a boarding house surrounded by narrow alleyways of packed dirt, and decides to clean the walkways. He hoses down the paths to keep the dust down, and on his journey encounters “voluptuous nude women who look as if they’ve stepped straight out of figure sketches or croquis drawings, [and] scar-covered elderly men who speak in foreign languages.”&nbsp;</span><span>The water uncovers corpses decomposing in the soil, posed as if they were swimming. Kojima returns to his rooms to call the police, but the corpses follow him and make themselves at home in his new residence. At the sound of the doorbell, the corpses transform into young men in relay racing gear. Their coach is at the door, and he’s furious.</span></p> <p><span>Any dream interpreters in the chat?</span></p>

It’s the latter that appears to apply for&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after someone managed to get the game running in first-person mode and discovered it became even more intense.</p> <p>Via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/arc-raiders-first-person-view-reddit/"><em>Polygon</em></a>, Redditor Short_Satisfaction_9 showed off the results of his fiddling with&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ console settings to force the game into a first-person perspective, and while the results are very janky-looking, they also show a version of the game where fighting is a far more frightening endeavor.</p>

   <p><em>Arc Raiders’</em> combat is already very tough, even if you’re completely avoiding PvP antics. The game’s PvE bots and drones don’t go easy on you at the best of times, but in third-person you at least have the advantage of somewhat mystical vision of your surrounding area, able to see incoming enemies at a good distance. In first-person, however, that’s all gone. It sets you up for an awful lot more surprise attacks, and given how unbelievably worked up I get playing the game already, this really isn’t something I’d be clamoring for.</p>

 <p>It’s also not something anyone else can do now, as Embark has just removed access to the in-game console. That’s for a good reason too—over the weekend, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-ninja-shroud-embark-patch-2000657708">following complaints of widespread player cheating</a>, many realized that the commands enabled PC players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q92qd4/embark_please_ban_everyone_who_use_that_console/">to switch off all fogging</a> and thus increase visibility by a wild amount. Something Xbox and PS5 players could not, giving PC cross players a ridiculous advantage over both them and their fellow PC players who weren’t doing this.</p>

   <p>On January 10, Embark’s community manager posted to the Discord to say that a hotfix was being rolled out to remove the “NewConsole” command, a vestige of its Unreal Engine basis that had accidentally been left in the game. That’s going to reduce an awful lot of cheating, but does mean the rest of us can’t experience the horror of a first-person view.</p>

            <guid>1403674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re a fan of first-person shooters and FPS games in general, you’re in for a treat in 2026. From epic multiplayer games to core single-player campaigns, there’s something for everyone.</p>



<p>Some genres and trends have come and gone over the years. First-person shooters will be here until the end of time, thanks to the fine, fun foundations laid down by the likes of Wolfenstein, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-bethesda-must-go-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a>, Call of Duty, Duke Nukem, Battlefield, and many other Hall of Fame-worthy franchises.</p>



<p>2026 already looks like a rootin’, tootin’, shootin’ good time.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-first-person-shooters-launching-in-2026">Biggest First-Person Shooters Launching In 2026</h2>



<p>One important thing to note about this list of big-time shooters coming in 2206 is that <strong>everything is subject to change</strong>. The video game industry can be great at times, but delays and unexpected events can alter plans in a heartbeat. Some games are one GTA 6 delay or date change away from a drastic U-turn. So bear this in mind with the attached release dates.</p>



<h3 id="h-highguard">Highguard</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Everyone needs to be on guard for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a>. It quickly became one of gaming’s biggest enigmas after its The Game Awards 2025 reveal. The game effectively closed the show, and the reception wasn’t good. Official Highguard social media pages also weren’t active in the weeks following. There’s still a feeling that it could do <em>something</em>. </p>



<p>It’s made by former Respawn Entertainment devs, which means it should be as mechanically efficient and effervescent as it can be. Whether the interest in another free-to-play shooter is there remains to be seen, but it might have been written off prematurely.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: January 26</strong></p>







<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High On Life 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out critics weren’t as high on High On Life as Squanch Games may have expected. However, this didn’t stop everyone from gulping down a helping of Fleeb juice, throwing back some Schleems, and seeing what the Rick and Morty-inspired shooter on Xbox Game Pass. The interest was there, and it was enough to push through a sequel. If you enjoyed the first game, High On Life 2 should be worth checking out, and if you decided to give the first game a pass, you should maybe consider shouting “Show me what you got” at the follow-up.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-toxic-commando">Toxic Commando</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Saber Interactive is on a bit of a heater at the moment. Not content with the nightmare-inducing Hellraiser debut or the studio’s brilliant work on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 (and the upcoming sequel), the team has concocted Toxic Commando. It can be enjoyed in either single-player or multiplayer, but there’s a real emphasis on fun and freakish terror when played with more people. You need to battle through eight missions of hideous creatures with your backbreaking arsenal of weapons and implements, and it looks like an old-school FPS delight!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 12</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-mouse-p-i-for-hire">Mouse: P.I. For Hire</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Fumi Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Insider Gaming team is very excited about Mouse: P.I. For Hire. The rubberhose animation immediately makes it an endearing and unique-looking game, bringing back fond (and frustrating) memories of StudioMDHR’s Cuphead. Instead of cutesy-looking bosses, Mouse: P.I For Hire is a clever FPS making excellent use of its theme and style. It’s an FPS game at its cartoonish core, but you only have to watch a trailer to realise there’s an unmistakable air of bold brutality about it. Mouse: P.I. For Hire could be one of 2026’s sleeper hits.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 19</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-marathon">Marathon</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Bungie</figcaption></figure>



<p>After months of testing and trying to work out the kinks to ensure Marathon is not DOA on release, like many are already condemning the extraction shooter to, Bungie is gearing up for the game’s March 2026 release. The game has literally been on a marathon in the last 12 months: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/artist-accuses-bungie-of-plagiarizing-work-for-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plagiarism</a> claims, low internal <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/morale-at-bungie-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-over-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morale</a>, and the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Director leaving Bungie prior to the game’s release</a>. The shooter has endured it all, and even now, the game’s future feels like it could go either way. It could still end up as one of 2026’s biggest shooters, and try not to become another Concord.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Halo Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to see Halo: Campaign Evolved being anything but a win. There’s a quiet acceptance that its PS5 release signals the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end of the console wars</a> and is the beginning of the series’ PlayStation arc. Still, the OG Halo campaign stands head and shoulders above most contemporaries and modern-day shooters that can only offer pale imitations of a legendary story. No multiplayer is a disappointment, but if you want to experience some of the purest and smoothest shooting mechanics in any video game ever, Halo: Campaign Evolved has the goods.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-hell-let-loose-vietnam">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Expression Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Vietnam conflict is still remembered as one of the most brutal wars, one that lasted for two decades. Hell Let Loose is the pinnacle of realism in military shooters, and the new Vietnam setting is a purist’s paradise for those wanting to indulge in a dark period of human history. Insider Gaming experienced a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, with Tom Henderson saying: “Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.”</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026-modern-warfare-4">Call of Duty 2026 (Modern Warfare 4)</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty will always happen, and whatever does happen with each release, <em>another </em>one will be waiting just around the corner. It’s the best-selling FPS franchise by all metrics (including Guinness World Records), and Black Ops 7 will be consigned to history come the end of 2026. Why? It will be time for Call of Duty 2026—rumored to be Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly set in North &amp; South Korea</a>, and a BIG effort and push will be needed after the coldly-received Black Ops 7. Even if there’s not, everyone will still buy it anyway.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: Late 2026 (Oct/Nov)</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Shutting Down Crucial, Micron Says It’s Trying To “Help Consumers”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shutting-down-crucial-micron-trying-help-consumers/</link>
            <guid>1403671</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Back in December, Micron announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/micron-shutting-down-its-consumer-crucial-ram-and-ssd-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down its consumer memory</a> and storage brand Crucial. At the time, the company said it was due to the “AI-driven growth” within the industry. Now, just over a month later, Micron is addressing the decision to shutter the budget-friendly brand in favor of powering data centers and large AI companies.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WCCFTech</a>, Micron’s VP of Marketing, Mobile, and Client Business Unit, Christopher Moore, was asked about the decision and the consumer backlash that followed. </p>







<p>Moore says that the “perception may not be exactly correct” from his point of view. The perception being that the company turned its back on consumers to favor large companies and the continued expansion of data centers. He says that the decisions being made are done to “help consumers around the world.”</p>



<h2 id="h-micron-is-still-involved-in-the-consumer-market">Micron Is Still Involved In The Consumer Market</h2>



<p><strong>“So, I would never want to tell someone what to think or that they’re wrong, but our viewpoint is that we are trying to help consumers around the world,”</strong> he said. <strong>“We’re just doing it through different channels. We still have a very sizable business in the client and mobile markets. We are also, of course, servicing our data center customers.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“And what’s going on right now is that the TAM and data center is growing just absolutely tremendously. And we want to make sure that, as a company, we help fulfill that TAM as well.”</strong></p>







<p>Moore said that it’s still suppling LPDDR5 to companies like ASUS and Dell, which he uses to defend is point on helping consumers. He said that the company is <strong>“in contact with every single PC brand out there to supply memory modules”</strong> and holds a <strong>“large portion of the consumer supply chain through the OEM model.”</strong></p>



<p>That said, Micron <strong>“cannot ignore the demand coming from AI right now.”</strong></p>



<p>Regarding the continued shortage of memory and storage, Moore believes that things might not get better until 2028. At least, on Micron’s side. They are working on building new facilities, including a new facility in Idaho scheduled to open in mid-2027 as well as facility in New York. But, Moore says that everything won’t be up and running until 2028.</p>



<p>In the meantime, consumers might have to stick with their older machines a while longer as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices continue to soar</a> throughout the market. </p>
