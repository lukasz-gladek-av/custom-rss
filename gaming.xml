We're still in the first weeks of a new year, and we can all now officially confirm that it's...another year. Hmm.</p>
<p>Enough <em>dwelling</em> - there's more than enough of that to do when you click elsewhere on the web. Let's talk video games, shall we? Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month, we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>. Check out the submission guidelines at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>So, let's see what you've got to say...</p>
<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - January 2026</h2>
<h3>"[redacted] for his birfday" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I still don't have a Switch 2. I totally want one, but they're SO expensive (living in Japan but playing games from all over the world I'll have to buy the extra expensive "international" version, not to mention a new gigantic SD card since I'm 100% digital, a new Pro controller, etc.). And according to my spreadsheet, I've completed 85 out of 148 or so games on my Switch. I'd love to play fancy new games (or upgrades to older games) on Switch 2, but I'm not exactly in a hurry. In fact, when it was originally released I decided that I'd wait until fancy new colors or an even fancier limited edition of some sort got released.</p>
<p>Well, fancy new colors got released this week, and I absolutely love them. But... it's not a set, and buying a Switch 2 plus extra Joy Cons goes back to my initial complaint.</p>
<p>So like, how much longer do you think I should wait?? My son is demanding that I buy him [redacted] for his birfday, but out of spite I refuse to put that thing on my Switch, so I'd rather buy a Switch 2 and let him have my original to do with as he pleases. Yes, I know, I'm a terrible father. His birfday is approaching very rapidly, though, so I kind of want to use him as an excuse to just take the expensive plunge, but if I DO buy a Switch 2 and a day later Nintendo announces a limited edition Xenoblade 4 Switch 2 I'll never forgive him because obviously it will be his fault. To summarize concisely: Me want buy fancy non-standard Switch 2 but when is happen you think does???<strong><br>
Kurt Asbestos</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, excuses-wise, it definitely won't be getting cheaper anytime soon - and there's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">a good chance the price will go up</a>. Given the global challenges around production and distribution on top of the general economic strife, Nintendo won't be in a rush to put out the inevitable upgraded version, either.</p>
<p>Personally? I don't see them doing some crazy variant for a while. They might put a Triforce on it or something, but I can't imagine them doing a white one (for example) until they've got at least another holiday season ticked off. It would just anger recent adopters still stinging from the hole in their wallet.</p>
<p>Seriously, what monster contemplates putting a Light Purple Joy-Con into a non-matching Light Blue mag slot anyway? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"2026 has started"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>2026 has started (by the time of the next reader letters issue) and I have 3 Nintendo predictions for the year:</p>
<p>1. Tomodatchi Life Living the Dream gets a direct.<br>
2. The 40th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda isn't too big of a deal with Zelda news being saved for later in the year for the lead up to the Zelda movie.<br>
3. Pokemon Red, Blue and Yellow (and maybe Gold, Silver and Crystal) finally get a Switch release that is much more confusing and annoying than just adding it to Game Boy Nintendo Classics or selling them (be it an NSO price hike around the same time, a 3rd tier of NSO or some other new annoyance).<br>
<strong><em>Aidan</em></strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in Summer 2026.</p>
<p>"<em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> will also be available on Nintendo Switch, and the <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2!</em> special DLC pack — <em>Pokémon: Let's Go, Furret! and Let's Go, Porygon2! - Dazzling Crystal</em> — will be available for both platforms later in the year. Pre-orders will open after this broadcast and come with a limited-time bonus: the original <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em> for Nintendo Game Boy, available exclusively with this DLC set until February 27th, 2027. Please look forward to future announcements." <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"'more serious' platforms"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Where are all the new colour variations for the Joy-Con 2?! You know times are strange when 'more serious' platforms like the PlayStation and Xbox are churning out different controllers on a quarterly basis, whilst Nintendo leave us in the dark with the boring grey duo... Same for the Pro Controller 2! I'd personally love to see some colours pay homage to the NGC; Indigo, Platinum, and Orange, with coloured buttons to boot!<br>
<strong><em>Moochy</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they are, Moochy! No sooner had you sent this than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">Nintendo announced a new boring grey duo</a> with pastel accents.</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind seeing some more interesting colours, but I'd be happy if we could just get through the generation without drift.</p>
<p>Oh, and 'Orange' is so vulgar; it's <em>Spice</em>, darling. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"whip out something ridiculous"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi there NL gang,</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that with every Switch 2 Edition Nintendo conjures, there is a unwritten rule that each title must be longer than the other!</p>
<p>*Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV*<br>
*Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star Crossed World*<br>
And god forbid... *Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabell Park.*<br>
I mean, seriously though, where *do* you draw the line when it comes to something like this? Does Nintendo even care if we need to take a breath midway through announcing them?!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now, those three games above _are_ fairly lengthy titles in their own right.<br>
So I think we're safe... and of course now that I've said that, they'll whip out something ridiculous like *Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition = Lubba's Fury* ...There's just no escaping it!<strong><br>
Nintoz</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has become an office joke around these parts. They start to look like equations if you stare at them long enough. 'Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Bowser Jr.'s Big Bash', anyone? <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"great plastic"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Nintendolife!</p>
<p>I’m a big Zelda fan and I love collecting items from the series. Unfortunately, Nintendo hasn’t released new amiibo for quite some time, despite there being so many interesting characters that could be made into these great plastic figurines.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I’d like to leave you an idea for a poll on the site...<br>
<strong>Franc001</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, let's do it. (The Mineru's Contruct amiibo is still to come, remember.)</p>

<p>Not a bad selection! A comically enormous Deku Tree amiibo would make me grin, but I'd like a Sprout, too. And a Mido. And a Deku Scrub. An... <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>It's really cheesy, and not the good kind of cheese." - <strong>L27</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>All kinds of cheeses are good, my friend. Except that Wensleydale with the fruit in it. Horrific idea. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>it's probably a steaming pile of dung." - <strong>WoomyNNYes</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey, if it looks like dung, and smells like dung, and tastes like...</p>
<p>Oof, probably should have stopped after the first two, in hindsight. Anyone got a Tic Tac? <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>Has research been conducted on this?" - <strong>Davis</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm surrounded by people in lab coats brandishing clipboards as we speak. Several of them are wearing glasses. Spared no expense. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above). Type your name, email, and beautifully crafted letter into the appropriate box, hit send, and boom — you're done!</li>

		<p>During the Dragon Ball 40th anniversary event, Bandai Namco confirmed that Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will be getting new DLC, including new characters, stages, new costumes and new super attacks. All of this is in addition to the free Mission 100 update that will be coming to the game on January 26th, allowing players to use different characters to clear challenges and missions.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO – New DLC Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxDRoyx8zG8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new characters that appear to be confirmed for the Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero DLC include Super Android 17, King Piccolo, Super Saiyan Bardock, Spike the Devilman, Grandpa Gohan, Champa, Tao Pai Pai, Zangya and Pikkon. There is also a glimpse at the new costumes for some of the characters and a very brief view of some of the new stages. The DLC will arrive in the Summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS, with the Switch and Switch 2 releases being staggered for after.</p>

<p>In our Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero review, Jason said, <em>“As a modern successor and sequel to the classic PS2 era Budokai Tenkaichi trilogy, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is a great time for Dragon Ball fans. You’ll have to ease yourself into the controls, but once it clicks it’s a lot of fun to explore the full roster and smash anime characters together.”</em></p>

		<p>Bandai Namco has announced a brand new Dragon Ball game, and it is going to be a completely new entry to the series lore. New Game Project Age 1000 is being created by Akira Toriyama, who is expanding the Dragon Ball universe with new characters and a new world. The teaser trailer shows us who will presumably be the new main protagonist, with this character having the ability to go Super Saiyan.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL | NEW GAME PROJECT &quot;AGE 1000&quot; Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HW4vLS8HIzs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The unnamed protagonist is part of the Capsule Corp and has the initials GS imprinted on his uniform, which could either be a clue related to his name or a rank of some kind. The trailer shows this character battling in a virtual training room against masked attackers, before a mysterious figure enters the room causing the unknown protagonist to go Super Saiyan. More details are expected at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which is taking place on April 18th and 19th. The Age 1000 game is expected to launch in 2027.</p>

<p>We went tactical <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift-ds">last week</a>, as we matched up a pair of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a> on the DS, and it's got to be said, the results were the most one-sided we've seen in a long time. The bright European / Japanese version took home a staggering 90% of the vote, leaving the bland North American variant with a measly 10%. <em>Oof</em>.</p>
<p>With a new Yoshi game on the horizon, we're throwing it back to one of the delightful dino's most beloved entries (in the handheld space, at least), as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/super_mario_advance_3_yoshis_island">Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island</a>. Those with a good memory might remember us tackling the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/08/poll_box_art_brawl_duel_55_-_super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">SNES original</a> way back in 2020, but the GBA version comes with a pair of covers all of its own, so let's take a look at them.</p><div><figure data-videoid="bhK3W_3CW7w" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytbhK3W_3CW7w" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhK3W_3CW7w?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e97fgtxisn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0d7b39a2a9d7d"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - NA/EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d7b39a2a9d7d/sma-yoshis-island-naeu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European and North American cover will be instantly familiar to those who remember the SNES layout. It sees Yoshi and Baby Mario merrily making their way across the island as a giant Nep-Enut emerges from the water behind them. It's clean, it's colourful, it's iconic.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="3d1c930803cc2"><a title="SMA: Yoshi's Island - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d1c930803cc2/sma-yoshis-island-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/2227-super-mario-advance-3-yoshis-island">Nintendo / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the flipside, the Japanese design opts for something far less level-based. Baby Mario and Yoshi still take centre stage, but they are instead surrounded by a bunch of other Yoshis, all decked out in different pastel colours to stress the multiplayer potential. The pink background might not tell you quite as much about a typical level structure as the NA/EU cover, but it is really rather cute.</p>

Dragon Ball Super: The Galactic Patrol is currently in production, and fans will have to wait until 2027 to see Son Goku and Vegeta battle it out against Moro.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/25/dragon-ball-1769330257081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A key visual for the new Dragon Ball Super anime was revealed.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Age 1000 Game Project</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, Iyoku was joined on stage by Dragon Ball Games producer Masayuki Hirano, who revealed a <a href="https://youtu.be/pLscMRafsLI?si=W0B4WUhoWDBBte_m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>flashy trailer</u></a> for a brand new game project, Age 1000. However, the game’s official title will be announced later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Age 1000 project is good news for fans who thought they would never see any new creations from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama after his death in 2024. Apparently, Bandai Namco started developing Age 1000 around seven years ago, and Toriyama himself put a lot of work into the game’s worldbuilding and brand new characters. The trailer shows a mysterious grey-haired young man decked out in Capsule Corp gear, with Hirano revealing that “I asked Toriyama sensei to create this character especially for the game.” Although the new character seems like a new Super Saiyan, Hirano was tight-lipped about who he is. However, fans will have to wait for Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 (to be held on April 18-19 in LA) for further details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The project’s name calls to mind Dragon Ball Online, which took place in the age 1000- so it seems the new game will also be exploring this time period. “We have spent a long time carefully crafting this project.” Iyoku explained. “I think this game will allow us to experience a brand new part of the Dragon Ball world.” Age 1000 is slated for a 2027 release.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dragon Ball Sparking!

The trailer for the DLC teased even more playable characters (including Super Android 17 and Demon King Piccolo), new costumes, new super attacks for Vegeta and Goku, as well as new stages and modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming DLC will also have its own theme song, Zero, sung by series veteran Hironobu Kageyama- who is known for his many Dragon Ball Z theme songs. Kageyama performed the new song, saying he was honored to contribute to Dragon Ball again after 18 years. With Zero, he aimed to create a cheerful and powerful song that will energize anyone who hears it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who can’t wait, producer Furutani also reminded PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam players that Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero is getting a free DLC on January 26, the Mission 100 single player mode (which longtime fans will remember from Dragon Ball Budokai Tenakichi 3).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>The Dragon Ball series is currently celebrating its 40th anniversary, and as part of a special '<a href="https://youtu.be/SkH1AHJDW6E">Dragon Ball Genkidamatsuri</a>' event this week, Bandai Namco has shared some video game announcements.</p>
<p>First up, there's <a href="https://en.dragon-ball-official.com/news/01_3963.html">"breaking news"</a> regarding the latest game in the works. It's the official announcement of the new game project "<strong>AGE 1000</strong>". This title, which will get an official name at a later date, has been in development for "about 6 to 7 years now including the initial concept phase". It features a new "never-before-seen world and characters" from legend and series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/akira-toriyama-the-dragon-ball-dragon-quest-and-chrono-trigger-artist-that-inspired-the-world">creator Akira Toriyama</a>, who passed away in 2024.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Toriyama-sensei has been heavily involved in this AGE1000 project, in its world-building, characters, and many other aspects."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>AGE 1000 is currently "set for 2027", although no platforms have been revealed at this point in time. As for the details about this story, the team was willing to say much at this stage, but 'AGE' refers to the year in the Dragon Ball world. There's already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1qm6ekl/comment/o1jvyhv/">plenty of speculation</a> about the game as well.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball fans can expect more information about this game at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026, which kicks off in April.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2df8bce7b51fc"><a title="Dragon Ball Age 1000" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2df8bce7b51fc/dragon-ball-age-1000.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some other Dragon Ball video game news, Bandai Namco and Spike Chunsoft have announced new "major" DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a>. More details about the Switch and Switch 2 release will be revealed in the future. For now, here's a brief description and trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super Saiyan Bardock, Super Android 17 (GT), Great Demon King Piccolo, and more will be joining the lineup of playable characters! Plus, customizations for skills and outfits, new stages, and a new single player mode are planned to be added!</p>
<p>This fabulous DLC is scheduled for release on PlayStation®5, Xbox Series X|S, and STEAM® in summer 2026, with more details on the Nintendo Switch™ and Nintendo Switch™ 2 release to come!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ahead of this new DLC, there'll also be some free updates. This includes 'Mission 100' mode ("where you use your favourite characters to challenge and clear various missions") and 'Survival Mode'. The 'Mission 100' mode will arrive on 26th January 2026 on other platforms, and 'Survival Mode' is currently scheduled for Spring.</p>
<p>This new DLC will arrive later on the Switch and Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hero-of-justice-pack-70050000060002-switch/">DLC 1</a> also scheduled for Winter 2026 and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dragon-ball-daima-character-pack-1-70050000060109-switch/">DLC 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-dlc-3-70050000060111-switch/">DLC 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-shallot-dragon-ball-legends-70050000060113-switch/">Extra DLC</a> arriving in Spring 2026.

            <title><![CDATA[Dragon Ball ‘AGE 1000’ is Revealed, and Fans Think It’s Dragon Ball Online 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/</link>
            <guid>1415407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Dragon Ball team recently revealed an all-new project, codenamed ‘AGE 1000’, set to be released in 2027. In a short trailer posted online that showcased a never-before-seen character, it was confirmed that a full reveal will take place on April 18 during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to pick up on the AGE 1000 reference, which until now, has only been used in connection with Dragon Ball Online. This MMORPG debuted in 2010 but has long since been shut down, being replaced somewhat by <em>Xenoverse</em>.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-2027">New Dragon Ball Game Coming 2027</h2>



<p>The Dragon Ball team wrote on social media that AGE 1000 offers ‘a new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama,’ the father of Dragon Ball. You can see the two-minute teaser trailer below:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Announcing a New Dragon Ball Game Project, "AGE 1000", set for 2027!<br>A new world and new characters brought to life by Akira Toriyama!</p><p> The latest updates will be unveiled at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in the U.S. on April 18-19.<br>Stay tuned for more information. <a href="https://t.co/ouBqvz5FwA">pic.twitter.com/ouBqvz5FwA</a></p></div>— Dragon Ball Games (@dragonballgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonballgames/status/2015246051461210565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Eagle-eyed fans spotted the AGE 1000 reference in seconds, pointing out that, until now, the only other game to use that setting was Dragon Ball Online.</p>



<p>In <strong>that </strong>game, players are transported to the age 1000 in a time-traveling adventure that sees them explore an open-world environment, search for Dragon Balls, and interact with NPCs and other players on their journey. It boasted multiple classes and races, several settings in terms of time and location, and diverse quest mechanics.</p>



<p>While Dragon Ball Online died years ago, <em>Xenoverse </em>almost took its place, adopting the core story elements and character creation features that surfaced in DBO.</p>



<p>This is why fans think AGE 1000 is a direct follow-on (or reboot) of Dragon Ball Online.</p>

<p>Following the release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mysims_cozy_bundle">MySims Cozy Bundle</a>, there's reportedly been a new EA survey sent out to select Sims players, and it's believed to be hinting at a new MySims game for the Switch and other platforms.</p>
<p>It apparently suggests the game would be a "cozy, collaborative adventure simulation" title where players can "explore a whimsical world, customize their village, befriend residents &amp; pets, and uncover delightful secrets".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ywlqip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>This title would supposedly offer solo play and multiplayer with "up to four friends". Many <a href="https://simscommunity.info/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/new-mysims-game-features.jpg">other features are listed</a>, too. This latest development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-removed-ea-app-listings-suggest-more-mysims-revivals-might-be-on-the-horizon">discovery of some MySims game listings</a> in January last year.</p>
<p>Following the release of MySims on the Switch, EA's CEO Andrew Wilson mentioned how the Cozy Bundle had performed "well ahead" of the third-party giant's expectations.</p>
<p>In our review, we gave the Switch bundle seven out of ten stars and said the titles were still engaging and easygoing spin-offs.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/rayman">Rayman</a> series is currently celebrating 30 years, and it seems an announcement could be taking place soon.</p>
<p>A new rating has appeared on the Australian Classification Board for <strong>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition</strong>. The classification took place on 22nd January 2026. Additional details list Atari as the developer and publisher, and UI Entertainment as the applicant.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ee436245b45a"><a title="Rayman - Game Boy Color Box Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee436245b45a/rayman-game-boy-color-box-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ubisoft kicked off Rayman's 30th anniversary celebrations last September and it followed with some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/">rumours about a Rayman Remake</a>.</p>

<p>Relive the classic war between WWE and WCW in WWE 2K26.</p>



<p>During the WWE Saturday Night’s Main Event special on January 24, WWE announced that the most expansive edition of the upcoming WWE 2K26 video game would be the Monday Night War Edition. The cover features top WWE stars from that era, like The Rock, Stone Cold, and Triple H. There are also top WCW wrestlers from the 90s, such as Goldberg and the nWo.</p>



<p>Pre-orders begin on January 30.</p>



<figure></figure>











<figure></figure>



<p>As announced on January 23, WWE 2K26 will also have a special <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/">Attitude Era edition</a>. The key art for that edition features many legends from the 1990s and 2000s. WWE and 2K have yet to announce who will be featured on the standard edition of the game. Still, much more information has been revealed about the forthcoming WWE video game.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/">As first reported by Insider Gaming, </a>four new match types will be playable in this year’s release. WWE 2K26 will introduce the new Dumpster Match while reviving three classic match types once playable in previous games: the Inferno Match, the I Quit Match, and 3 Stages of Hell. </p>



<p>Also, the Island mode is slated to return this year with an all-new storyline providing the backdrop for the open-world action. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-island-returns-wwe-2k26-new-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>







<p>As of now, 2K Games has not announced any perks for pre-ordering the game, but noted the Monday Night War Edition would provide access to the most content. There’s also no set release date or price point. Previous iterations of the game have released in March. Insider Gaming will keep you up-to-date with the latest WWE 2K26 news.</p>

            <p>
How do teens in IT classes waste their time these days? When I was a young whippersnapper, when my teacher wasn't looking I'd head to sites like Miniclip, Nitrome, wherever I could get my hands on some Flash games, to play all sorts of little oddities, particularly system heavy ones that were fun to mess around with for 10 minutes once in a while. Games like that feel rare now with the death of Flash, but I think Tower Lab, a physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> tower defence deckbuilder where you attempt to blast enemies off a ledge into an infinite void to their demise, feels pretty close.
</p>
<p>
Tower Lab works thusly: there are two portals, one where variously coloured upright beans are emitted, another where they enter. You are presented with a selection of cards, all of which cost a certain amount of points, points which you are in limited supply of, that allow you to plant different bits of machinery to try and shove these enemy beans off a ledge.

<p>
These machines come in a range of flavours. For example, one is quite simply a fan, turning on every so often to attempt to push the beans off. Some beans are too heavy, however, so you might place a shrink ray earlier along the tower so that they're easier to blow off. A gif on the game's Steam page shows how you can take this even further by shrinking them down, making them weightless, blowing them away, before making them even larger than before so that they fall to their deaths. Systems! They're quite neat, and from what I can tell your technical know-how will be put to the test more and more over the course of the game's various levels.
</p><p>
This is exactly the kind of game I would have loved messing about with as a distracted teen. IT class is a waste of time! But a game like Tower Lab isn't. It's quite satisfying in small doses, and levels don't waste your time either. I quite like the foundations that have been laid here, and look forward to recreating scenes from my youth when it launches later this year. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3084810/Tower_Lab/">here</a>.

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>

			<p>The rumors of a <strong>Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake</strong> have gotten a lot louder over the past month. To kick things off, dedicated CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in mid-December</a> that Code Veronica and <strong>Resident Evil Zero</strong> would be <strong>the next remakes</strong> on the schedule, with the former targeting a 2027 launch and the latter aiming for a 2028 debut. A few days ago, he added that the closest game to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-resident-evil-remake-that-starts-with-c-and-ends-ode-veronica-will-be-announced-this-year-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be formally announced sometime in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Now, though, we have another renowned insider confirming the rumor and even adding to it. <strong>Nate the Hate</strong>, probably <strong>the most reliable insider</strong> at the moment (he also won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award in a community poll on Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors), <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2014767509803512263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a>:</p>



<p><em>Yes, Code Veronica is being remade and deep in development. Target of release is the first half of 2027.</em></p>



<p>This means we might be just a year and a few months away from being able to play the game. So far, all three Resident Evil remakes have been successful, although 2 and 4 have been more successful and critically acclaimed than 3. RE2 Remake is now <strong>CAPCOM's third best-selling game of all time</strong> with <strong>16.30 million units</strong>, only behind Monster Hunter World and Rise, and the far more recent RE4 Remake (which launched in March 2023) is closing in with <strong>11.10 million units</strong> already sold. RE3 Remake, on the other hand, is at <strong>10.60 million units</strong>, which is still not shabby.</p>



<p>In late 2023, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-more-remakes-coming-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> they were working on more remakes. Franchise fans had long been yearning for the Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake, and for good reason: <strong>the original game was originally an exclusive for SEGA's final console, the Dreamcast</strong>. Sure, it eventually launched on PlayStation 2 and later on GameCube, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, but by then, it was old and didn't get much traction. </p>



<p>For those who haven't played it and are looking forward to this remake, the game takes place about three months after Resident Evil 2. Its protagonists are <strong>the Redfield siblings</strong>, Claire and Chris, who desperately try to survive a viral outbreak <strong>at a remote prison island in the Southern Ocean</strong> and <strong>a research facility in Antarctica</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rayman is getting a 30th Anniversary game, and it has been rated in Australia.</p>



<p>Rayman was Ubisoft’s mascot at one time, and while the series may be best known today for introducing the Rabbids, Rayman was one of the premier adventure-platforming titles. The original game was released in 1995 for PC, Sega Saturn, Sony PlayStation, and Atari Jaguar, and now a 30th-anniversary edition is coming to modern consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson recently stated on <a href="https://youtu.be/8rRejJWM3jg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Weekly podcast</a> that two Rayman projects were in the works at Ubisoft, and while one, codenamed “Steamboat,” is believed to be a remake of Rayman Legends, Insider Gaming understands that this project is currently under the codename “Iceman.”</p>

<h2 id="h-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-s-rating-in-australia">Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition’s Rating in Australia</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Australian classification </a>has rated the currently unannounced title as G, safe for the General Public, with very mild content and minimal impact. Specifically, this game is noted as having very mild violence. The classification date is listed as Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>The game is listed for release on both the Nintendo Switch and the Sony PlayStation 5. Atari is listed as both the publisher and developer. Atari also handles the remakes and new releases in the once-popular Bubsy franchise.</p>







<p>Even though Rayman is no longer the face of the Ubisoft franchise, this remake comes at a time when Ubisoft is undergoing a massive restructuring in its own right. Recently, the planned remake for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was shelved as the company moves forward in a new direction. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Sometimes, the world you live in sucks. It is a place filled with despair, and misery, and blood, guts, and death. This is much the case with the world of Mörk Borg, an apocalyptic fantasy TTRPG where you have no sense of hope, only dread, that is now also a video game. This video game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mork-borg-heresy-supreme">Mörk Borg Heresy Supreme</a>, is more of an action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, though its tabletop routes are still to be found, and it is as mean as it is darkly enchanting.
</p>
<p>
Stylistically it very much takes after its original book form, using only black, white, yellow and red for its colour scheme (you can guess what the red is used for). In the demo version of the game there is only one class to choose from, whose stats and starting weapon are randomly generated. Though, you can just re-roll infinitely until you get something you've happy with, an ability I hope is limited in the full release.

<p>
To start, you are tasked with finding a troll finger. You set out into the world, this miserable little world, on a 2D plane, your only directional options being left or right. When you finally meet enemies, you can slash at them with your weapon, be it a femur, a knife, or a scimitar you pick up after slicing a skeleton in half. There's a dodging mechanic, you both consume items for health or lob them at your opponents for damage, this starting class can also kick or block with a shield. It is laborious in a way that teeters on the edge of being insufferable, though I expect it'll fall right off for some.
</p><p>
Everything is slow, some of it perhaps a bit too much so, yet there's a method to the madness. You don't have much health, so timing a block or a dodge and a slash at just the right time is important. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> comparisons are all but guaranteed to be made in future reviews. I died quite quickly, of course, this game is tough and cares not for your happiness. Dying almost seems like it's the point, especially with its lightly procedurally generated world.
</p>
<p>
The RPGness of it all comes in the occasional dice roll, a digital D20 randomly deciding your fate, your character's attributes assisting or impeding said rolls. Levelling up comes at set points apparently, with some skills improving, others worsening. It is a player hostile game, one that begs for you to challenge it, and that'll be a boon for many, and a curse for many more.
</p>
<p>
It's too early for me to say whether I like the thing or not, but I can say I'll be curious to give it another look whenever it does come out. In the meantime, you can check out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3216800/MRK_BORG_Heresy_Supreme/">here</a>.

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Soon after it launched in 2019, Taiwanese horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devotion">Devotion</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-disappears-from-steam-after-pooh-review-bombing">pulled from sale</a> following some controversy regarding Chinese president Xi Jinping and Winnie The Pooh (long story). It was made available for purchase again <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devotion-devs-are-selling-it-themselves-after-gog-chickened-out">a couple of years later</a>, though it should have been a touch earlier than that as it was promised to be released on GOG late 2020. However, on the same day it was announced to be returning, GOG put out a statement saying they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-back-down-from-re-releasing-devotion">wouldn't be releasing it after all</a>. Now, half a decade on from that, managing director Maciej Gołębiewski reflects on the decision to not put it up for sale, after it stood by selling the also controversial Horses.
</p>
<p>
"That situation remains difficult to reflect on," Gołębiewski told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-reflects-on-devotion-delisting">Eurogamer</a> in an interview. "At the time, we made that decision in the context of very real business constraints, a limited understanding of the complex geopolitical factors at play, and a lack of good options that would both protect GOG and partners and allow the game to be released responsibly. In hindsight, we acknowledge that this decision - and the way we communicated it - understandably damaged the trust our users have in us."
</p>
<p>
Gołębiewski went on to say that in order to keep a "global digital storefront operating means navigating legal, operational, and commercial realities that don't always allow for ideal outcomes. In 2020, we chose a path we believed was best for GOG, even though it came at a cost to our credibility." 
</p>
<p>
When it comes to a game like Horses, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">banned from sale on Steam supposedly over an outdated scene</a>, he feels that the situation was different, saying that its sale on GOG didn't pose any "legal, political, or operational risk to our business or partners. There was no other concern driving this decision, just a straightforward evaluation of the game itself."
</p><p>
I am not entirely convinced by his reasoning, I have to say. GOG explained that they were pulling Devotion from sale at the time <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1339227388438306817">like so</a>: "After receiving many messages from gamers, we have decided not to list the game in our store." Of course, this might have just been the public reason presented at the time, and Gołębiewski is now telling the true version of events, but I find it a bit tough to believe that they hadn't considered the potential business and geopolitical factors up to that point (the game was nearly two years old by this point). Still, better to have at least one storefront that willingly releases games with difficult themes occasionally than not at all, I suppose.

<p>As Nintendo continues to celebrate Milestones like the 40th anniversaries of the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda franchises, key developers from Nintendo’s history are entering the next phases of their lives as well.</p>



<p>Legendary producer Kensuke Tanabe recently announced that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be his final game at Nintendo. The news was shared in an interview with the Japanese magazine<a href="https://www.ndw.jp/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Nintendo Dream</a>, which was later posted on<a href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405257646218805574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Weibo.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-kensuke-tanabe-confirms-he-s-worked-on-his-last-title-at-nintendo">Kensuke Tanabe Confirms He’s Worked On His Last Title at Nintendo</h2>



<p>As <span>reported by&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><span>Vi</span>deo Games Chronicle</a>, Tanabe confirmed that he will no longer be involved in the studio’s production, but trusts that Risa Tabata and the team at Retro Studios will be able to continue moving forward should that be what Nintendo requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Completing this game took far longer than anticipated… Furthermore, I have confirmed that I will no longer be involved in the production of the series moving forward. Whether a sequel will be made is still uncertain, but I sincerely hope that one day, Ms Tabata and Retro Studios will be able to tell this story completely and bring it to a close.</p>



<p>It’s been 40 years since I joined Nintendo. Metroid Prime 4 will be my final title developed at Nintendo.</p>



<p>However, we didn’t set out to create anything ‘special’ because of this. Instead, we worked closely with Retro Studios, just as we always have with Nintendo projects, aiming to deliver a fun and unique experience for players of all ages and playstyles.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Following news about Tanabe, it was also confirmed that Hideki Konno, known for launching the Mario Kart franchise, left the studio in July 2025. </p>



<p>The news was confirmed via his private Facebook account. He received a special thanks credit in the recent Mario Kart World release and last worked on the Mario Kart 8: Deluxe DLC for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>







<p>Shigeru Miyamoto, the man behind the Mario and Zelda franchises, remains on board at Nintendo. Currently, he has been working closely with Universal on the release of the Super Mario Bros. movies. The forthcoming Super Mario Galaxy movie is due to release in April 2026. A Nintendo Direct will reveal new information about the movie on January 25.

<p>The days of the console wars of the 2000s, pitting Xbox, Nintendo, and Sony consoles against each other, have come and gone. These days, the Xbox team wants players to get behind the idea that everything is an Xbox. As part of the strategy, Xbox’s first-party games are beginning to release on PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>



<p>Recently, Xbox announced that the forthcoming Fable reboot and Forza Horizon 6 would both be coming to PlayStation 5, with Fable releasing across all consoles on the same day and Forza coming to Xbox platforms in May with a later release on PlayStation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/were-going-to-try-and-be-more-consistent-with-what-we-do-the-head-of-xbox-game-studios-on-the-developer-direct-reveals-multiplatform-strategy-and-hard-lessons-learned-from-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During the recent interview with Games Radar+,</a> Craig Duncan of XGS stated that his main focus is to ensure as many players as possible get to experience Xbox-produced titles. </p>



<p>When questioned about the consistency of titles across different platforms, Duncan admitted that, while strategies and realities change, they’re aiming to be more consistent with multiplatform releases in the near future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s always development realities about when these projects start – how big a team is, and what plans we have at the start of development. Like you said, when a strategy changes, maybe you’ve got a plan that exists with a game and maybe you can adopt that, maybe you can’t. So that’s why. And to be clear, this is totally fair feedback. Sometimes we are inconsistent. You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places. Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.</p>



<p>But you know, for our game makers, if you’re on the Fable team, you just want as many people who love Fable to appreciate the great work that the team’s doing. That’s always our goal. It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?</p>

            <p>Highguard is set to pull back the curtain with an "in-depth look at Highguard direct from the studio" on 26th January, which also just so happens to be the same day the free-to-play live-service hero shooter is expected to launch.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qR9Xbzt5t0">"official launch showcase"</a> will reportedly include a "full gameplay deep dive", plus plans for the game's inaugural year and "much more", which is just as well, as we have heard extraordinarily little about the all-new PvP raid shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">since its announcement trailer</a> at last month's The Game Awards, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite buying time to showcase the game at The Game Awards (or maybe because of it?), developer Wildlight Entertainment has shared very little since, which means we're just a few days off from release with just a 180-second reveal trailer to show for it. If it wasn't for the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-shows-signs-of-life-less-than-one-week-away-from-launch">Steam activity has picked up in recent days</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PS5 trophy list</a> has popped up, you'd be forgiven for thinking it had been delayed.</p><p>Hailing from several former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> developers, Highguard is a PvP raid shooter which will see players "ride, fight, and raid as Wardens". That is to say, "arcane gunslingers" who have been sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Hopefully we'll find out more when the showcase goes live at 6pm UK time on Monday, 26th January.</p>
<p>As for that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-really-is-alive-and-even-has-a-ps5-trophy-list">PlayStation 5 trophy list for Highguard</a>? There'll be 33 PS5 trophies in total, including Plunderer, which is awarded when a player opens and acquires loot from at least 15 chests in a single match, and Animal Control for eliminating 20 enemy mounts.</p>
