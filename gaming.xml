<p>"Most of our inspiration comes from the comic books"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are mere weeks away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> punching its way onto Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>1st December</strong>, and with the full character roster now out in the open, the team at Tribute Games has shared a breakdown of what we can expect from each fighter.</p>
<p>In the above video, the team explains how it assembled a lineup of both familiar and lesser-known faces, and how each character keeps things interesting.</p>
<p>We're sure that many people will be coming to this game only with knowledge of Marvel's big-screen appearances, though the team confesses that it has mainly taken inspiration from the comic books. This means that big players like Nova, Phyla-Vell, and Beta Ray Bill might not immediately stand out as the best-known of the bunch, though Tribute Games writer Yannick Belzil says this is completely intentional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good superhero lineup has very recognisable faces, but lesser-known characters as well, because it makes you lean forward. Like, "Who is she? Who is he? Who's that person?" You want to discover new characters, and we wanted to introduce new characters to our audience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of iconic figures in the game as well, and the video does a good job of also spotlighting the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Black Panther and Wolverine.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait until next month before we can pick our favourite fighters, but, as with every glimpse at gameplay footage that we get, we like what we're seeing.</p>

                <p>Lego's brick-built Game Boy replica is bound to be one of the most popular gift ideas for retro gaming enthusiasts this holiday. The 421-piece recreation of Nintendo's legendary 1989 handheld is wonderfully designed, fun to build, and looks great on a display shelf. It comes with two buildable games, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land, which can be loaded into the handheld's Game Pak slot. Swappable lenticular screens recreate moments from each game as well as the Game Boy's boot screen. The $60 price tag makes it one of the most affordable Lego sets made for adults. The Lego Game Boy launched October 1 at the <a href="https://sovrn.co/10gqen0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Store</a> and major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/pgr7z89" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/modu1on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><p>I spoke with Lego Group Senior Designer Carl Merriam over email about the design of the newest Lego Nintendo display model. Questions and answers are attributed to GameSpot and Lego, respectively.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>I've always been fascinated by the logistics of designing a LEGO set. How do you start? How do designers determine how many pieces each build should have? How do you choose the shapes and sizes of the pieces? Did the Game Boy go through multiple iterations before finding the right design? Can you provide a general overview of how a designer gets from the idea to a finished product?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We start with an idea. For the LEGO Game Boy the idea was: “Let’s make a LEGO set celebrating the original Nintendo Game Boy.” From there we built several different versions using existing LEGO Bricks. While doing that we determined that we would need a few new LEGO elements. We started developing the new LEGO elements and built many, many, many more versions of the LEGO Game Boy. Eventually we found combinations of pieces that looked like the reference, are stable when built and most importantly are fun to put together.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904"></a><figcaption>Lego Game Boy 72046</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Does the LEGO Game Boy set use any unique pieces not found in other LEGO sets?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: We developed a special 4x4 curved LEGO brick for the corner with the speaker, as well as a 6x8 tile for the back plate and a 2x4 bracket to build in the buttons. Many of the other pieces were existing bricks. The start and select buttons are tires, which originally launched in 1969, the A and B buttons are minifigure hats, AND we even managed to include a classic 2x4 brick inside.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What did Nintendo bring to this design, in terms of knowledge, advice, and secrets?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We work closely with Nintendo on all LEGO Nintendo products, and the Game Boy was no different. One of the most fun parts was working with Nintendo on what easter eggs to include and what game screens to replicate from Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening. Nintendo provided both design input on the build, as well as reference images of the actual hardware components.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>How important was it to make this set not only look like the Game Boy, but also feel like an accurate replica of a handheld device? At the same time, aspects such as visible studs on the D-pad make it evident this is a LEGO set. I imagine it's critical for a replica to still look like a LEGO set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: During the development of this set, we built many versions with different levels of functionality. Given the size of the original Game Boy, we were presented with the opportunity to figure out creative ways to include physical functions into the build. During this process, we found that it was possible to make all the controls interactive. My attention then shifted to trying to replicate the haptics of the actual hardware. I started to focus on each of the controls, the buttons, dials and power switch — testing different versions of the build to find the closest simulation of the sensation of holding a real Game Boy.</p><p dir="ltr">The studs on the D-pad are included for two reasons:</p><p dir="ltr">1. We like to include studs to add LEGO DNA, so you can see it is a LEGO model.</p><p dir="ltr">2. That combination of LEGO bricks (with the studs showing) allows the D-pad to be able to tilt as it does on the real Game Boy. Recessing it into the LEGO Game Boy and adding tiles to cover the studs was one of the possible design choices, but that would remove the functionality.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Are the buildable cartridges the same size as actual Game Boy games? If so, can the cartridge slot hold real games?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: Unfortunately not. The real Game Pak is slightly too big to fit into the LEGO Game Boy set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905"></a><figcaption>Lego's building set is a near 1:1 recreation of Nintendo's Game Boy DMG.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Were Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land always the cartridge choices, or were other games in the running? What's your personal favorite Game Boy game?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: After looking at several different games, we landed on these two first-party games to celebrate our longstanding partnership with Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">Link’s Awakening is my personal favorite Game Boy game. I have a vivid memory of calling the Nintendo hotline for some help getting the Hookshot while playing it.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What's the smallest detail on this set that you're most proud of? What was the biggest challenge you faced?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO:</strong> I used all my powers as both a veteran LEGO designer and a lifelong LEGO fan to make this set as excellent as possible, so there are lots of favorite things to choose from. If I have to pick just one... it has to be the power switch function. While working on this set, I focused on replicating all the haptics of the real Game Boy as closely as possible. I tried to make all the buttons press-able and the dials turn-able, but getting that power switch to slide and click like the real one... that is my favorite feature.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest challenge I faced was trying to replicate the dimensions of the real Game Boy. The closest LEGO dimensions to the form factor of the real Game Boy are: 11 studs wide by 18 studs long by 3.6 studs deep. Dimensions for LEGO Bricks tend to be in even numbers, so finding the right combination of elements to put the screen and screen surrounding in the center of the device was a real brain teaser.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Besides the Game Boy, what's your favorite LEGO Nintendo set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: It has to be the LEGO Super Mario Desert Pokey (71363). I love this set, it is so amazing how well it replicates the interaction with the Desert Pokey from the Super Mario games in real life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901"></a><figcaption>The Lego Game Boy includes three lenticular screen panels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lego Game Boy is the eighth <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DX3J6MT7,B0DRW6K649,B0CYM2V9FS,B0BXQ3M8JH,B0B2Y3WNH4,B0DF857JZ9,B08FCW3SB7,B09FMVDHDM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially licensed Nintendo building set designed for adults</a> and the second to release in 2025.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is filled with quests that require you to get things back up and running topside to help those down below get prepared to take the world back from the ARC. One such quest called Straight Record comes from Celeste, who sends you topside in the Dam Battlegrounds to turn on an old EMP. This task will require you to not only find the old EMP but also turn on multiple switches to get it going again--so if you're struggling to find them, we've got you covered. Here's how to complete the Straight Record quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find the old EMP trap for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>Completing the Straight Record quest does not require you to extract. As such, feel free to spawn into the raid using a free loadout to avoid any loss of resources in the event that you perish from enemies or other players while trying to get it finished.</p><p>Your first goal in Straight Record is to find the old EMP trap in the Victory Ridge area. This spot is located in the upper left side of the map just slightly southwest of the West Broken Ridge POI. Reaching this location shouldn't prove too difficult, though you may need to fend off a raider or two also doing the quest--or work together, if that's more your speed.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596490,1300-4596491" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll spot a tall, thin machine with wires wrapped around it. This is the old EMP, and you'll simply need to interact with it to discover that it's not powered on yet. This will begin the next part of the quest.</p><h2>Where to find the power switches for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>There are three power switches you'll need to turn on before you can activate the old EMP. They're all close by, though, so you won't need to venture far to get them turned on.</p><p>The first switch can be found on a small cliff just north of the old EMP. You can walk around the outside of the cliff to reach it. Interact with it to turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492"></a><figcaption>First switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg"></figure><p>The second switch is located just east of the old EMP on a collapsed structure.

You'll find it directly next to a tree, so go ahead and turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493"></a><figcaption>Third switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg"></figure><p>With all of the switches found, you're ready to return to the old EMP. Interact with it once more to complete the quest.</p><p>With the quest complete, you can decide whether you'd like to go loot some more before extracting, or simply head to the North Complex Elevator to the northeast to get the hell out of dodge before any other players come try to take you out. Either way, don't let your guard down, raider!</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full quest list</a>.</p>

Perhaps the most substantial of these is A First Foothold, which asks you to visit four locations across Blue Gate. Each of these is on a completely different side of the map (north, east, south, west). It's a lengthy quest that may prove dangerous, but we're here to help you figure it out.</p><p>Luckily, you won't need to visit all of these locations in a single raid, meaning you can always knock out the tasks across multiple visits if you prefer. You also don't need to extract for any of them to count, so feel free to handle this with a free loadout that you don't mind losing if things get hairy.</p><p>Here's how to finish all four requirements to complete A First Foothold.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Stabilize_the_observation_deck_near_the_Ridgeline">Stabilize the observation deck near the Ridgeline</a></li><li><a href="#Enable_the_comms_terminal_near_the_Olive_Grove">Enable the comms terminal near the Olive Grove</a></li><li><a href="#Nail_down_the_roof_plates_on_the_Raider_structure_near_Trapper_s_Glade">Nail down the roof plates on the Raider structure near Trapper's Glade</a></li><li><a href="#Rotate_the_satellite_dishes_on_the_church_roof__north_of_the_Data_Vault">Rotate the satellite dishes on the church roof, north of the Data Vault</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Stabilize_the_observation_deck_near_the_Ridgeline">Stabilize the observation deck near the Ridgeline</h2><p>The Ridgeline is located on the eastern portion of Blue Gate.

Early-Bird tickets will go on sale starting <strong>November 7 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET</strong>, and are priced at $250 for both days of the fan expo. This includes taxes and fees, and it comes with commemorative in-game items as a bonus.</p><p>These tickets will be sold while supplies last, after which, Blizzard will sell a standard ticket weekend pass for $290 starting November 18. This is $10 cheaper than the standard tickets sold for BlizzCon 2023, and it also offers full two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon on both Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>Fans looking to upgrade their experience can purchase a $500 ticket to BlizzCon Charity Night, an exclusive event with Blizzard developers, artists, and community representatives. This does not include access to the convention, and proceeds will go to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><p>There'll also be the Darkmoon Faire After Hours experience, an optional add-on that grants you entry to an exclusive three-hour event on the Saturday of BlizzCon.

Beyond that, the convention will see the return of the Blizzard Arcade, developer panels, and hands-on gameplay sessions for games like World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal. Presumably, these titles will have new content revealed for them, explaining their presence on the showfloor.</p><p>Last year, Blizzard said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/">it had decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> The show has been held on and off again throughout the 2020s, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. BlizzCon 2022 was a digital-only presentation, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/">BlizzCon 2023</a> was a traditional in-person event.

That's where Scrappy comes in. This little rooster hangs out at Speranza and gathers resources for you passively, which you can then claim each time you finish a raid.

Two common spots to round these up include the Testing Annex in Dam Battlegrounds and the Hospital in Buried City.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Lemon__Apricot__and_Olive_trees">Where to find Lemon, Apricot, and Olive trees</h3><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-get-lemons-and-apricots-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535901/" data-ref-id="1100-6535901">Lemons, Apricots, and Olives</a> grow on trees across multiple maps. While you can certainly find Lemons and Apricots early by looking hard enough in the swampy areas of Dam Battlegrounds, you'll have a much easier time collecting all of these fruits on the Blue Gate map.</p><p>Lemon and Apricot trees can be found in the Village POI in the northern section of Blue Gate. This is a high traffic area, though, and the trees are mostly found in the village's center, meaning you may be spotted by patrolling ARC or other raiders. Approach this location with caution. Try to get in, snag what you need, and get out. Don't forget to kick the trees when applicable to drop extra fruits!</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596914,1300-4596915" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596914-share_20251105_0434193.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596915-share_20251105_0434182.jpeg"></figure><p>Olives can be found very easily in the Olive Grove area in the south of the map. Simply wander around this area searching the ground beneath the trees and kicking them when possible to drop additional Olives. You may also spot a few Apricot or Lemon trees in this area, making it a great spot for obtaining all these fruits at once.</p><p>As a side note, even if you're just on Scrappy's second-tier upgrade, make sure you stock up on a lot of Apricots while looting, as you'll need a lot more for his fourth-tier upgrade.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Prickly_Pears">Where to find Prickly Pears</h3><p>Prickly Pears are found near cacti, which can be found all over the maps in Arc Raiders. However, the best spots to search tend to be on the outer perimeters of the Dam Battlegrounds and Buried City maps, especially in the northern part of the former and all along the southern section of the latter.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596918,1300-4596920" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"></figure><p>You'll find numerous cactus spawns all across these outer sections, though actual Prickly Pear spawns are far less generous. Just keep at it, though, and you'll eventually find enough to make Scrappy happy.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Mushrooms">Where to find Mushrooms</h3><p>Mushrooms are likely to be the hardest resource to find for Scrappy's upgrades. These spawn in damp areas across multiple maps, but they're quite contested since everyone needs so many of them. It's best to be ready for a fight if you're searching in any area known for Mushroom spawns.</p><p>Generally, your best bet for finding Mushrooms will be on Dam Battlegrounds. You can catch them growing on trees throughout the swamp area on the left side of the map, but some better locations to look include the Wreckage in the southeast and inside the Water Treatment Center.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596911,1300-4596912" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"></figure><p>For the Water Treatment Center, head to the interior hallways and follow the pipes. Mushrooms will often be growing beneath or on these pipes, so you're likely to find at least one per visit if you're searching thoroughly enough. Again, however, remember you may run into other raiders here, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

            <p>
I might not be massively into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> these days, but if there's one thing guaranteed to pique my interest in <em>anything</em>, it's a Disney Haunted Mansion crossover. So as someone who's been obsessed with the now five-and-a-half-decade-old theme park attraction since the age of three, it looks like a reinstall is on the cards. Epic has announced a "playful" new Fortnite experience celebrating Disneyland's 70th anniversary is launching 6th November.
</p>
<p>
Hints that something Haunted Mansion was afoot first surfaced on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/disneyparks/">official Disneyparks Instagram feed</a>, which shared an image of the attraction's iconic stretch room paintings, reimagined to include Fortnite characters like Peely and Fishstick. "This lobby has no windows and no doors", read the caption, suggesting the real chills, as they say, would come later.

<p>
And that 'later' didn't take long to arrive. Before we could even finish pondering why all this missed Halloween, Disney and Epic provided an answer: simply, there's more to it than those 999 happy haunts. The Haunted Mansion is coming to Fortnite this week as part of the newly announced Disneyland Game Rush; a "playful, limited-time" Fortnite Creative island "experience" designed to celebrate Disneyland's 70th Anniversary.
</p>
<p>
Starting in a Disneyland-inspired hub - featuring a central sculpture modelled on Sleeping Beauty Castle and a skyline of familiar resort landmarks - up to 11 players can branch off to explore one of seven "quick-play" mini-games. Haunted Mansion fans get Scavenger Haunt, Space Mountain is represented by Rocket Race, there's the Matterhorn: Slip-and-Climb, Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Sneak Out, Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown, Indiana Jones: Tomb Runner, and WEB-Slingers: Spider-Bot Blasters. By completing these mini-games, it's possible to unlock island-specific cosmetics, so if I don't get to manifest my head in a hatbox, I'll be wildly disappointed.

<p>
Speaking of disappointment, I was all ready to be a grump about the fact Scavenger Hunt wasn't exactly the massive Haunted Mansion Fortnite blow-out I was envisaging after seeing that original Disneyparks post, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-disneyland-game-rush-is-an-incredibly-authentic-first-step-into-fortnite-for-disney-parks">IGN has screenshots</a> of Disneyland Game Rush - complete with waltzing dinner party ghosts and, YES, a hatbox - and it actually looks pretty neat. 
</p><p>
Disneyland Game Rush launches on 6th July (you can find it using island code 4617-4819-8826) and serves as something of a prelude for the main event. Announced in February last year, Disney has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">partnered with Epic</a> to create an "expansive and open games and entertainment universe connected to Fortnite" which - judging by its concept art - looks very much like a virtual theme park. Perhaps we'll have more news on that soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Marvel Games and PlayStation's Insomniac Games have a good relationship. We wouldn't have three <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">Marvel's Spider-Man games</a> and one upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">Marvel's Wolverine game</a> without a strong relationship between both companies, and in a new interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games">Game Informer</a>, we got a bit more insight into just how good Marvel feels about the relationship.</p>



<p>General manager of Marvel Games, Haluk Mentes, spoke at length about the importance of Marvel Games and the studios it collaborates with being aligned in their approach to making anything with Marvel characters, and making something that is authentically Marvel.</p>



<p>"<em>The challenge is more complex: authenticity doesn't necessarily mean one-to-one fidelity to source or reference material, whether it's comics or animation or movies. It's much deeper in that we allow our collaborating teams to reimagine 'familiar yet original' incarnations of our characters based on their own creative DNA...We absolutely do not want to be derivative. Otherwise, what's the point of working with some of the best talent out there?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There’s a great sense of responsibility at play here: Marvel is an almost 90-year-old creative brand, yet it’s as fresh as ever because during all that time, each new generation grew up with Marvel, ultimately became creators and left their mark, and then passed the torch to the next generation.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We also actively seek collaborators that want to take on the same mantle. As is usually the case, once we complete a project together, they, too, become “Marvel.” Marvel’s Wolverine with our dear friends at Insomniac Games is perhaps the epitome of this philosophy. We have been working together for more than a decade and developed such a shorthand across multiple Marvel’s Spider-Man games that when the time finally came to bring Logan back in spectacular and visceral fashion, it was obvious to everyone on our team that Insomniac was the perfect choice. It was our shared culture and values that brought us together, and we’re so proud to continue collaborating for many years to come.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-foresees-more-acquisitions-in-its-future.1344625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that making more studio acquisitions will form a key part of its business strategy in future, so it looks like we can expect to see more Nintendo subsidiaries popping up before too long.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supplementary document</a> accompanying the Japanese gaming giant's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" rel="nofollow">latest financial results</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa sets out how he intends to strengthen Nintendo's "business foundation".</p>

<p>Part of those efforts, Furukawa says, will be "acquiring development companies to make them subsidiaries", as well as "augmenting [Nintendo's] development facilities", all of which is intended to help "strengthen the internal game development organization" within Nintendo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-developer-acquisitions-xenoblade-chronicles-x.jpg?itok=5r_72rHj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-developer-acquisitions-xenoblade-chronicles-x.jpg?itok=r6Ac6BsK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More Nintendo subsidiaries, like&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith Soft, appear to be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>Other initiatives Nintendo is putting into effect to strengthen its business end include "building software assets in non-game entertainment", i.e. pursuing opportunities related to other media, and "maintaining and expanding [its] relationship with consumers".</p>

<p>Some of Nintendo's existing subsidiaries include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/luigis-mansion-3" rel="nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mario-strikers-battle-league" rel="nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>&nbsp;</em>developer Next Level Games, as well as Monolith Soft, the studio responsible for the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>series of RPGs.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant also owns Retro Studios, the developer to whom work on&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-reboots-metroid-prime-4-hands-development-to-retro-studios" rel="nofollow">handed back in 2019</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">hotly-anticipated first-person shooter</a> is set to finally launch next month.</p>

<p>Some studios that technically aren't Nintendo subsidiaries, despite frequently working with the publisher, include&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em>'s HAL Laboratory,&nbsp;<em>Mario Tennis&nbsp;</em>developer Camelot Software Planning, and Masahiro Sakurai's Sora Limited, all of which could be potential contenders for Nintendo's next acquisition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-developer-acquisitions.jpg?itok=ZIdeiMRY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-developer-acquisitions.jpg?itok=AlL2_haB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>developer Sora be next on Nintendo's list of acquisitions?</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's pledge to acquire more developers comes after initial numbers indicate that the Switch 2, which was released back in June, is a roaring success for the company. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console by March</a>.</p>

<p>The news also comes after Doug Bowser, who was appointed as president of the company's American division in 2019, will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-of-america-doug-bowser-retiring" rel="nofollow">step down at the end of the year</a>. His role will be taken by Devon Pritchard, who's currently serving as NOA's revenue and marketing executive VP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has released a new update for its PlayStation Portal device that allows you to stream PS5 games without needing your main console handy, but you'll have to be a PlayStation Plus Premium member to use it.</p>

<p>As outlined in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/cloud-streaming-officially-arrives-on-playstation-portal-today-with-new-support-for-digital-ps5-games-in-your-library/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the update, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update" rel="nofollow">entered beta last year</a>, is being released today at 6pm Pacific (so you'll need to wait until 2am tomorrow morning if you're in the UK like me).</p>

<p>If you're a PS Plus Premium member, you can now stream PS5 games from your own library; not every game is supported, but Sony says the feature is available for "thousands of PS5 games", including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, and the recently-released&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=2hG2ghhE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-menu.jpg?itok=s3AKgPDY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games can now be streamed directly to your PlayStation Portal.</figcaption></figure><p>Prior to the update, you could only stream games to your PlayStation Portal if you were near your corresponding PS5, but you can now do so anywhere with a high-speed internet connection.</p>

<p>You'll also find a brand new home screen for the Portal as part of this update, with a brand new dedicated Cloud Streaming menu that shows which games can be streamed to your device without needing to connect to a PS5.</p>

<p>As well as the new Cloud Streaming stuff, the latest update also brings new features for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming, including 3D audio support, a new passcode lock system to protect your Portal, and a network status screen that displays connection quality.</p>

<p>Cloud streaming additions include support for in-game purchases, new accessibility options, and the chance to receive game invitations from friends who are playing the same game as you. What a time to be alive, eh?</p>




<p>This latest PlayStation Portal update will be released today at 6pm Pacific/9pm Eastern, and it arguably brings the device one step closer to that dedicated Sony handheld <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonys-playstation-portal-gets-release-date-while-fans-keep-asking-for-real-portable" rel="nofollow">some fans have been clamoring for</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-drone-glitch-is-still-ruining-matches.1344610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <em>Battlefield 6</em> recently, and during nearly every session, my friends and I run into at least one group of players taking advantage of an easy-to-pull-off drone glitch that lets you get to areas that are normally impossible to reach. It’s been a problem basically since EA’s FPS launched last month, and it’s shocking that it’s still an issue weeks later.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched on October 10. And less than a week later, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o83uar/friends_reaction_to_the_drone_exploit_is_priceless/">there were already posts on Reddit</a> of people using a newly discovered glitch to reach rooftops that shouldn’t be accessible on maps like Iberian Offensive. All you have to do is have a recon player plop down their remote drone, get another player (or two) to stand on the drone, and then smack it with the sledgehammer as the drone flies up. This will send the players and the drone upward, allowing people to then hop off the drone onto roofs, towers, and other out-of-the-way spots easily. Then squadmates can spawn on that player, drop ammo, respawn beacons, and rain lead and explosives down on players below who have very limited ways to counter.</p>

  <p>After numerous <em>Battlefield 6</em> updates and patches, nearly four weeks after it was discovered, the drone glitch is still a problem. The bug isn’t useful on every map or mode, but it can ruin certain maps if many squads are doing the glitch. I played one match where running around on the ground was like exploring a ghost town, as most players were drone glitching and sniping.</p>

 <p>Another recent match with friends on Iberian Offensive saw two enemy squads use the drone glitch to start racking up kills. Eventually, we decided to become rooftop police and used the glitch ourselves to hunt the other players down, and then hid a beacon up there so we could periodically check in and make sure they weren’t using the drone glitch. It was kind of funny, but when it happened again after that night, we were all so tired of it. Players in chat were also fed up, sharing angry messages about how it was annoying that EA and Battlefield Studios hadn’t fixed this bug or at least turned off the sledgehammer or drone while a fix is developed. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oj4ai3/drone_exploit_is_still_in_the_game_i_have_no_words/">You can find similar posts on the BF subreddit</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/">where players frequently complain</a> that the bug is still a problem after weeks of <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/battlefield-6-bug-reports-en/drone-glitch---iberian-offensive-map---to-fix/12874527">players sharing videos and screenshots of it in action.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>At the very least, we know the drone glitch is going to be removed eventually. On November 5, <em>Battlefield 6</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037795308343366">confirmed that it had been fixed</a> and that the fix would be applied in <em>BF6</em>‘s next patch. He wouldn’t say when to expect that patch, but considering how frequently EA has been updating the shooter since launch, I doubt the wait will be long. And that’s great, as <em>BF6</em>‘s drone glitch has been a problem for too long.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s majestic. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Universal ways to buy the Pokémon Phantasmal Flames ETB are using the Pokémon Center, online retailers, resellers, or hoping for the best with physical stores.</strong></p>



<p>Using a reseller should be your last hope, as they will be resold for extortionate amounts. Pokémon Center stock is usually hit or miss, and you might have to have real-life battles with other collectors for in-store ETB boxes!</p>



<p>Here’s a handy list of online retailers currently advertising Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Boxes. Be warned that pre-orders are either close to selling out or have already. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have plans to tweak aim assist settings for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> controller users – but that hasn’t stopped PC players from digging into the files to turn off crossplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson <a href="https://x.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985520194148802793" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed</u></a> BF Studios would be “reverting back” to open beta controller aim assist settings in an X/Twitter post earlier this week. It’s a major change, especially for those on console, that fans have pleaded for since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Far less stickiness so it does not create that rotational persistence that is currently live. Consistent slow down, no ramp. Recoil reduction is a separate system from AA but will be getting adjusted also once the new tech is online.</p>— Matthew Nickerson (@The_n0ttus) <a href="https://twitter.com/The_n0ttus/status/1985523272935735804?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Nickerson says the change back to open beta settings will arrive “shortly,” adding that recoil reduction adjustments are also coming soon. Although PC and console players have disagreed on how aim assist has changed since the August open beta tests, many feel the settings have been tweaked for the worse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the beta, aiming and shooting felt really satisfying, but now the aim feels completely different,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o5kwn3/is_it_just_me_or_does_the_aiming_feel_completely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment</u></a> posted shortly after launch says. “Making micro-adjustments is harder; I find myself fighting with the aim.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m not the greatest on controller but I’m pretty good and I can also say confidently that this problem did not exist in the beta,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o5mbs0/something_seriously_wrong_with_bf6_aim_assist/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment at the time</u></a> said. “Aiming and aim assist felt perfectly fine on controller.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios has made more than a few adjustments to Battlefield 6 that have had players up in arms, but the post-beta changes related to aim assist have been especially controversial. They’ve been so divisive, in fact, that some PC players recently started tearing through the game’s files just to avoid players using the controller assistance feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The workaround comes from content creator and X user @otterTweets, who <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1985715884455817538" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>revealed the method</u></a> for those who are “tired of OP aim assist.” They say diving into the files at “documents/battlefield 6/settings/steam/PROFSAVE” and adding “GstGameplay.CrossPlayEnable 0” turns off crossplay completely.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, unsurprisingly, a catch for those who do this, though. Ottr says turning Battlefield 6 PC crossplay off drops affected players into lobbies populated with bots instead of real-world players. If enough PC users switch crossplay off, they could theoretically begin playing with more actual players, but it could take some time to really catch on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With EA and BF Studios actively preparing to release aim assist tweaks for controller users in Battlefield 6, PC players may want to hold off on finding their own ways to sneakily turn off crossplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s taken five years for Pablo Clark to design and refine and illustrate The Old King’s Crown, his very first board game. Over that time, whispers have been growing among playtesters and convention crowds that this title, where players take the role of asymmetric factions competing to win the rulership of a fantasy kingdom, was something special. Something, certainly, that was better than we had any right to expect of a first-time designer. Now after a self-publishing <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGYp6?object_uuid=f0d6abee-5dc3-4c4c-a98f-7950a303dab2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter</a> run, it’s finally here, and we can explore Clark’s kingdom in all its glory.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/old-kings-crown-contents-1762351601127.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no discussing The Old King’s Crown without first talking about the art. It’s right there on the box lid, after all, and it is stupendous. Rich with color and detail, stylized yet recognizable, bringing to life in glorious precision a world that has never existed. The fact that the designer is also the artist just makes you wonder how he got to the front of the queue when talent was given out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when you slide off that sumptuous box lid, the art is everywhere within, almost every picture adding to the story and the setting. It’s on the board, which is a window from a high tower looking down on the provinces of a kingdom in civil war, as though players are plotting in their fastnesses while the people suffer. It’s on the deck of tarot-sized cards for each faction, filling in the wide narrative gaps in the brief rundown given to the setting in the rulebook. It’s on all the kingdom cards, faction-neutral buffs available for players to pick up. And it’s all astonishing: every time you play, you’ll notice something new.</p><div catalogid="87d6e367-43c9-48ae-b67f-213da2b5fae4" id="230074"><div id="230074" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Old King's Crown</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All the graphic design and component quality here is sumptuous and spellbinding. The layout of the rulebook with its pictorial examples, the way the board carefully walks you through the stages of each turn, the pleasing color and layout of each faction's markers and central board, embossed with pockets to hold cards and chunky, printed wooden pieces of the matching color. The remaining few generic items: a turn marker, clash order markers and a few other bits and pieces are simple black-and-gold wood. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assembled as a whole, it takes up a massive chunk of table space – but it looks incredible, a wood-and-cardboard invitation to stop and stare, a whole world laid out in squares and circles for those who take the time to look and appreciate.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220916954-1762351693931.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is quite a complex game, but the complexity is in the sheer information density available rather than the core flow of play, which is relatively straightforward. Games last a fixed number of turns, normally five, and each turn is broken down into four seasons. The meat of proceedings takes place in summer, where players will fight over three locations, each of which has two possible rewards, to be chosen by the victor. First, in turn order, players place their herald into one of the victory spots, which will bring them bonus points if they win there. They can then place some of their small pool of supporters in a location, which provide a small combat bonus. Then it’s time for the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All players start with functionally identical card decks from which they draw a hand of six. Everyone places a card, face down, next to each location. Then they’re resolved one at a time, with everyone flipping over a card and adding the number on that card to the number of supporter pieces there. Highest total wins. Except, very often, it doesn’t. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s no discussing The Old King’s Crown without first talking about the art... It is stupendous.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for this is that many cards have action icons which can be invoked to complicate matters. Ambush, for example, lets the owner play a second card into the melee. Flank lets that card slide out of the current combat and into a future one. There are others, but most terrifying of all is Deadly, which takes place after all other actions and kills enemy cards, putting them out of the game and into the dreadful “lost pile” for the remainder of play unless they have a helmet or shield icon, the latter of which also keeps them in the fray for that location.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220908515-1762351715288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to overstate quite how taut this is. Someone flips the cards and all at once everyone’s craning over the massive board, desperate to decode the game’s intricate array of symbology to work out who’s in contention and what the next steps might be. Combats that are decided by ambush, or value ties which are resolved with additional card play, crank the excitement up even more, as do deadly attacks which can see critical cards assigned to the lost pile forever. And then when it comes to heralds, the stakes just go through the roof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the locations score you influence, the game’s name for victory points. But if you win in a space where you’ve placed your herald, you get an extra point. And if you win in a space where you and others have placed their heralds, you get to take a victory point off each of those poor unfortunates. This is a game where a winning tally can be 15-20 points, so actually taking points off other people to add to your own is huge. A well-calculated herald placement can swing you from last place to first in one fell swoop, ensuring that everyone is in contention, right up until the end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, this invites all kinds of scheming. Discard piles are public information, so you can grub around in people’s trash, seeing if they’ve played that deadly card or whether it might be lurking in their hand, still, to screw you over. It’s also possible for players to buy additional cards to add to their deck, which not only come from asymmetric stacks tailored to your faction, but can add even more wrinkles to the formula, like making it lowest card wins instead. You’ll need to keep an incredibly sharp eye on what everyone else is doing if you want to minimize the chance of nasty surprises.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-202658346-1762351731206.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying new cards is only one way in which the game’s asymmetry shows. Each faction has a set of four special one-use powers, plus a fifth that you can invoke if you win a particular location. They’re all unique, and roughly aligned to that faction’s thematic play style. The Gathering, which represents the cult-like state religion, can swap the positions of two cards in combat, or sacrifice cards into the lost pile in order to gain resources to buy more cards. The uprising, by contrast, which is a revolution of the state’s common folk, can give cards the deadly effect, or the retreat effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you begin to weave together the various unique card effects, asymmetry, special powers, and location victory effects you can begin to see all sorts of ways you can influence not only individual clashes but the game state as a whole. Your hand size will drop as the game progresses, except you can arrange things so it doesn’t. You’ll lose supporters, unless you find a way to gain them back. If you buy enough new cards you’ll get a point bonus, but you’ll have to make big sacrifices to do it. The number of ways you can approach The Old King’s Crown and still win is absolutely jaw-dropping, almost mind-crushing in its loops within loops within loops.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The number of ways you can approach The Old King’s Crown and still win is absolutely jaw-dropping.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And still there’s more! We’ve only really covered the summer turn so far. In spring, players use cards to bid in a selection of kingdom cards, most of which are game-breaking in their own right. They can let you swap cards you’ve drawn for one in the lost pile, steal other player’s special powers, or give your cards extra effects. Each is easily enough to build a strategy around by itself, but you can hold up to two of them. Except that after the initial bid, you can steal kingdom cards off other players instead of taking a fresh one, forcing them, and you, to replan on the fly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the autumn you can send cards journeying, which gives you the chance to buy more cards, or you can send them to council, where they stay and give a long-term special ability. This can mean potentially more points if you win with your herald, the chance to grab supporters back, or other effects. Finally winter is just a bookkeeping phase and, frankly, a chance to catch your breath after the absolute <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic</a> and social insanity of an entire round of The Old King’s Crown.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220935670-1762351747833.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not an exaggeration. While there’s a staggering amount to enjoy here, the sheer quantity of detail you need to take into your stride to maximize your chances is almost overwhelming. You need to be on top of your own special powers and special cards, along with everyone else’s, what they’re buying, what they’re playing, what’s in their discard pile or the lost pile. You need to be cognizant of each player’s kingdom cards, what they do and what you need to bid to steal them, or protect your own. Initially this seems impossible. It gets easier with practice but you’ll need to play an incredible amount of this game if you want to properly internalize it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You don’t, however, need to do all that in order to win. It’s perfectly fine to play from the hip more, although the reams of detail will nag at the edges of your thought processes as you do so. And you can get away with it because, fundamentally, you can check every discard pile in the game and still not be certain whether a player has just thrown down their deadly card into a herald location or whether it’s a tricky bluff. You can do very well just by reading faces, voices, and body language. And that creates a strange tension at the heart of The Old King’s Crown: it’s a game that gives you the most astonishing range and leverage to build strategies, and then lets other players pull the rug out from under you with a cunning bluff.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/pxl-20251017-220855966-1762351770916.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGr26q?object_uuid=f0d6abee-5dc3-4c4c-a98f-7950a303dab2&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Waterstones</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Nov 5, 2025 4:09 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">In a market crammed with identikit optimization games and party titles, it’s rare to be able to say this but there is nothing else out there like The Old King’s Crown, neither visually nor mechanically. This is a grab bag of concepts from all sorts of other games, each given a loving polish and shape to fit it into a greater whole, wrapped in the most amazing eye candy, creating a unique package. To do justice to it, it’ll need to be on your table for weeks as you come to grips with its intricacies. Some players may find the information density overwhelming. Others may find the central dichotomy of having such a rich information density that can be torn apart by a simple bluff frustrating. But however you end up feeling about it, it’s worth experiencing for its sheer sensual and experiential overload.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-old-kings-crown-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dante’s Inferno celebrates its 15th anniversary this year. Not that there’s been any fireworks or cake. Visceral Games’ 2010 hack-and-slash, which saw a crusader named Dante battle through the nine circles of Hell in an attempt to save his fiancee Beatrice from Lucifer, didn’t leave the massive, zeitgeist-defining impact that publisher EA had hoped for. Plans for an even bigger, more ambitious sequel were unceremoniously laid to rest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more than a decade, the game’s sizable cult following has wondered what the next steps of the journey would have looked like. Dante’s Inferno was very loosely based on the first third of Dante Alighieri’s epic 14th century poem The Divine Comedy, which imagines its author journeying towards Heaven, and so a sequel would presumably have carried the story into Purgatory and, finally, Paradise. Aside from the fact that it would have involved some kind of war between Heaven and Hell, no details of the cancelled project have ever escaped onto the internet. All that remains of it has been kept under lock and key by EA, gradually fading into legend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, until today. After talking with a number of sources close to the project, IGN has obtained an assortment of hitherto unpublished internal documents, including concept art, cutscene storyboards, screenshots of rudimentary level geometry, and – last but not least – a 240-page script penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin that outlines every stage, boss battle, and plot point planned for Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio (or, more elegantly, simply Dante’s Purgatorio.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Taken together, these materials not only show that Dante’s Inferno 2<em> </em>made it further into the pre-production process than previously thought, but also that Visceral had planned to take the sequel in a slightly different direction than expected. The plot, for example, would have blended The Divine Comedy with another Biblical epic, John Milton’s Paradise Lost, which reimagines Lucifer as morally ambiguous as opposed to a thoroughly evil figure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sequel’s underlying design philosophy would have been retooled as well. “The first game was heavily influenced by God of War,” one former Visceral employee told IGN. “At the time we were working on the second [game], Uncharted 2 was having a big influence on single player games: cutscenes and quick time events were being replaced with scripted gameplay sequences where the player has full control over the character.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So much of the original game was classic hack-and-slash in the arcade, Mortal Kombat tradition,” Jonathan Knight, the original game’s creative director, told IGN, hinting at what he wanted the sequel <em>not </em>to be. “Here’s an arena, some gameplay happens, then you move through a tunnel to the next part of the level. Some of that’s inevitable in a game, but the really great ones figure out how to make believable, natural environments.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Had the developers been allowed to realize their creative vision, Dante’s Inferno 2 was planned to be to Dante’s Inferno<em> </em>what Assassin’s Creed 2 was to Assassin’s Creed, or God of War 2018 to the original trilogy: a sequel that dared to go above and beyond the confines of its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We cannot show you a game that was never made. But we can offer you an unprecedented insight into Dante’s Inferno 2’s entire campaign. What follows is a comprehensive (but by no means complete) written reconstruction of what playing this game would have looked like, from start to finish.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/lucia-reveal-storyboard-full-1761172647789.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">St. Lucia, who was first introduced in DLC for Dante's Inferno, would have been a major character in the sequel.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dante’s Inferno 2: Purgatorio - The Complete Story</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 1: Dream in Eden</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the script, Dante’s Inferno 2 would have opened in the Garden of Eden. Dante, lying in the grass, awakens next to Beatrice, cradling a baby girl who – she tells him – is their daughter. “Tell me this is real,” he says, but when he looks again, both the baby and Beatrice have disappeared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is when you’d be given control of Dante, who looks for Beatrice in the garden as the opening credits roll across the screen. You’d be able to press a button to call out her name, prompting her to respond and, in turn, allowing you to follow the sound of her voice. By the time you catch up with her, Eden has grown uncharacteristically dark and moody.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s opening boss, an enormous snake made of black smoke, appears from nowhere. Armed with your trusty scythe and cross, you battle to free Beatrice from its grasp, only when you get to her, she’s no longer herself. Having reassumed her corrupted, Queen of Hell-form from the original game, she speaks in Lucifer’s voice: “You’re dead, Dante!” The ground beneath you opens up, and you disappear into a bottomless chasm. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 2: At the Shores of Purgatory</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One title sequence and “previously on” montage later, you resume from where the ending cutscene of the original game left off: with Dante emerging from a cave and being too awestruck by the glory of Mt. Purgatory to notice that the cross-shaped tapestry he tears off his chest transforms into a small, red snake upon hitting the ground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Though defeated at the end of the first game,” Knight recalls, “Lucifer is able to come back through this device of the tapestry, which is really a representation of Dante’s sins. He’s not forgiven, and he’s still carrying his wrongdoings with him.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the snake slithers away unnoticed, Dante sets off in search of Beatrice, who – he informs via voiceover – awaits him somewhere up the mountain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On a beach at the foot of the mountain, Dante encounters Cato, a Roman senator who serves as a guardian of Purgatory. Giant and half-embedded into the cliffside, he welcomes a group of newly arrived souls that includes Beatrice’s brother Francesco, a fellow crusader whom Dante defeated – and absolved – back in Inferno. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dante tries to follow Francesco to the mountain, but Cato – sensing the former is “besmirched by the blackness of Hell” – stops him. When they clash, however, the red snake from earlier inexplicably bursts forth from Cato’s mouth, splitting his face in half. The beach itself splits also, giving way to a hellfire-filled crevice. “So it begins,” Lucifer’s voice announces as his army of demons launches a full-scale invasion of Purgatory. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/cato-cliff-concept-art-1761173531120.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Roman senator and pagan, Cato, guards the shores of Mount Purgatory.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A cutscene introduces us to Michael, the senior of God’s archangels. Looking down from Heaven, the divine magistrate sizes up Lucifer’s forces before sending down an army of his own. “Angelic airships” pierce through the clouds above Eden and make their way down the mountainside, where Dante has now found himself in the midst of a chaotic battle between angels and demons. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attacked from both sides, Dante comes face to face with Lilith. The original wife of Adam, she was seduced by Lucifer and now serves as his second-in-command. Similar to the boss fight against Death in Inferno, your battle ends with Dante taking Lilith’s weapon: another scythe, but with a unique move set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Lilith reports to Lucifer that everything is going “according to plan,” another key character makes their first appearance. It’s Dante’s guardian angel, Saint Lucia. First Introduced in the original game’s Trials of St. Lucia DLC, she rescues Dante from a burning airship by teaching him how to perform a Spirit Jump.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 3: Ante-Purgatory</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Once they reach safety, Lucia tells Dante he should not blame himself for unknowingly helping Lucifer escape from Hell. Introducing the game’s central plot point, she reveals that “there is a larger power at work.” The invasion is part of a plan that God communicated to her and her alone, one that ends with Dante defeating Lucifer once and for all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If only God had clued in Michael, too. Taking no chances, the chief archangel decides to close the Gates of Heaven that connect Eden to Paradise – a drastic, irrevocable measure that would keep out not just Lucifer and his demons, but also worthy souls like Beatrice. To make sure she can enter Heaven, Dante must find her and bring her to Eden before the gates are shut.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, he won’t have to do it alone. To show Dante the way up, Lucia summons an old friend: Virgil. Temporarily freed from Limbo, the Roman poet who guided you through Hell in Dante’s Inferno explains that, if you succeed, he too will be allowed to go to Heaven. With goals, stakes, and ticking timebombs established, the journey officially begins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Access to Mt. Purgatory proper is monitored by the Vicar of Saint Peter, a “massive angel with five wings” which he uses as legs “like a giant spider.” As with Cato, ordinary souls are let through, but Dante and Virgil are not. A boss battle – the “biggest and most exhaustive” yet – ensues, and despite Virgil’s protests, Dante ends up killing the Vicar: a crime guaranteed to place them on every angel’s radar. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/vicar-concept-art-1761173752974.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Vicar of Saint Peter would use its wings as both legs and weapons.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Levels 4 and 5: Pride / Envy</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">From here, the game falls into a consistent rhythm. On each terrace, Dante and Virgil interact with souls, some of whom Dante recognizes from his mortal life in Italy. Unlike in Hell, where people are tortured as punishment, the inhabitants of Purgatory suffer in the hope of earning redemption: the prideful carry giant boulders on their backs, while the envious wander around with their eyes sown shut, just as described in the poem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before they can leave the Terrace of Envy, Dante and Virgil are ambushed by Gabriel, the second archangel. Once God’s primary mouthpiece, Gabriel hasn’t heard from his Lord in eons, so why would He speak to Lucia? “If God truly commands you,” he warns Dante, “let’s see Him protect you from me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, it’s God who ought to protect Gabriel from Dante. After losing a tag-team boss battle in which he fights against you with his fellow angels – and witnessing your impressive spirit powers – Gabriel’s skepticism dissipates. Believing in Dante’s mission (“I feel Him in you…”), he orders his underlings to help rather than hinder us. From here on out, the player will be fighting alongside Gabriel’s angels, not against them.  </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 6: Wrath</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On the next terrace, Wrath, Dante and Virgil find Beatrice. Greeting Dante by punching him in the face, she’s still angry about everything that happened to her in the first game, and although – pious Christian that she is – she’d rather earn her way into Heaven through honest penitence, news of Lucifer’s approaching army convinces her to come along. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On this terrace, Dante and Beatrice enter a Vision Cave together. Inside, they are confronted with two episodes from their past: one of the night Dante slept with another woman while he was out fighting in the crusades, and another of the night Beatrice, having learned of Dante’s betrayal, spitefully agreed to marry Lucifer. Afterwards, Dante battles not a sin-demon, but Beatrice’s Queen of Hell-form, vanquishing her for good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Lucifer’s forces hot on their tail, Dante, Beatrice, and Virgil head for the next terrace. On the way, they again run into Gabriel, who offers to give them a ride. Before they can take off, however, they are interrupted by another archangel, Uriel, who is in a very bad mood. He’s recently discovered that neither Michael nor Gabriel have heard from God in a very long time, and so every order he’s obeyed since Lucifer’s exile has been based on lies. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/uriel-concept-art-1761173889884.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Archangel Uriel would have been one of the major antagonists of Dante's Purgatorio.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gabriel tries to explain himself, but Uriel didn’t come looking for answers: he tears off his brother’s wings and cuts off his head with a flaming sword. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separated from Virgil and Beatrice in the ensuing chaos, Dante runs into Lucifer. To everyone’s surprise, he’s not here to fight you but to <em>thank</em> you. After all, you helped him escape from Hell, opened the gates of Purgatory, and mowed down hundreds of angels standing between him and Heaven. You aren’t fulfilling God’s plan – Lucifer doubts He even exists. Instead, you’re a pawn in <em>Lucifer’s </em>plan, and have been from the very moment you first followed Beatrice into Hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Know the truth, Dante,” he says. “It has always been I, guiding you in your darkest moments, destroying everything you loved. Your entire life leading you to this moment has been shaped by me, and no other!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having dented Dante’s spirit, Lucifer vanishes. Alone and full of doubt, Dante is eventually discovered by Lucia, who – once she’s been filled in – can neither confirm nor deny what you have heard. She has no proof – only faith. It’s enough for her. But is it for you?</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Levels 7, 8, and 9: Sloth, Greed, and Gluttony</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Reuniting with Virgil (Lucia has taken Beatrice with her up the mountain), you discover that Lucifer’s forces have overtaken you, turning the remaining terraces of Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, and Lust into apocalyptic wastelands littered with dead angels, downed warships, and enemies Dante previously faced in the original game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the duo hurries to catch up, a cutscene set in the demon camp shows Lucifer telling Lilith that, from here on out, she is no longer second-in-command, but will be taking orders from Uriel, who has officially crossed over to the dark side. When Lilith protests, Lucifer – suggesting he never loved her – casts her out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next three terraces all revolve around big set pieces. In Sloth, you have your final encounter with Lilith. Determined to hit her ex-boyfriend where it hurts, she’s decided to kill Dante herself. The boss battle – which sees her trick Dante by pretending she’s actually an innocent person under Lucifer’s spell – ends with her death. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the climb to Greed, you fight a Phlegyas – one of those gargantuan fire-demons you encountered in the Anger level of Dante’s Inferno – which is scaling Mt. Purgatory like the Titans from God of War 3. Climbing its body, you defeat it by triggering a Possession-powered explosion that leaves a “Death Star”-sized hole in the mountain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Terrace of Gluttony, Virgil is captured by vine-mouthed demons. They imprison him inside a cage dangling from the Tree of Knowledge, the same tree that bore the fruit which Lucifer used to drive Adam and Eve out of Paradise. Corrupted by Hell, it now resembles the love child of a hydra and a Venus flytrap. To save Virgil, you have to fight the tree and restore it to its original form. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 10: Lust</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">On Lust, the final terrace, Dante and Virgil finally catch up to Lucifer’s army, which is trying to break into the Garden of Eden. After they explore the final Vision Cave and confront Dante’s lustful desires (complete with.. ahem… a love-making QTE sequence), Lucia shows up with an airship to take you to the summit.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you can reach your destination, a furious Uriel reappears. Despite hurling his flaming sword at Dante, it’s Virgil instead who takes the fatal blow. After the poet dies in his arms, Dante battles the archangel, killing him in the same way he killed Gabriel. Part of this boss fight takes place in the skies above Eden, with Dante sprouting angelic wings made of light and circling his foe. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/22/uriel-vs-dante-concept-art-1761174159121.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dante and Uriel clash at the summit of Mount Purgatory.</figcaption></figure></output></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Level 11: The Garden of Eden</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Uriel may be dead, but Lucifer’s forces push onwards. In an attempt to buy himself more time to find Beatrice in the Garden of Eden, Dante helps the angels hold the line in a two-phase tower defence minigame. After blasting the approaching horde with a cannon and washing away demons by redirecting waterfalls, you’re finally able to make it to the top of the mountain.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beatrice awaits Dante inside the garden. Searching for her in a gameplay sequence reminiscent of the opening act, their reunion is once again interrupted – not by a giant snake, but Michael, descending from Heaven in a chariot drawn forth by a griffin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dante begs Michael to hold open the Gates of Heaven so Beatrice can pass through. But the archangel won’t budge, having concluded that God has abandoned him in favor of Dante. “For what does it matter who rules in Heaven, if God has forsaken me?” he says, grabbing Beatrice and ordering his champions, a 24-strong team of elite angels, to kill Dante. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of the fight, Eden is gradually consumed by hellfire. Eventually, you are interrupted by Lucifer. He wields a spear, and on it – the severed head of Saint Lucia. Realising the scale of the threat on his doorstep, Michael reluctantly promises to let Beatrice enter Heaven if Dante manages to defeat Lucifer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Lucifer defeated, Michael lets Dante and Beatrice pass through the Gates of Heaven just before they close, as promised. Seeing the dazzling City of Paradise in the distance, they hardly have a chance to breathe before Beatrice walks up to Michael and, to everyone’s surprise, slits his throat. Smoke spews out of her mouth, and Lucifer rematerializes. Thanking you once more for carrying out his plan, he takes your scythe – <em>his scythe</em> – and kicks you off the edge of Paradise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dante falls. Past the Garden of Eden, past the terraces of Mt. Purgatory, past the beach, past the nine circles of Hell, all the way down to the frozen surface of Lake Cocytus, where Lucifer was originally imprisoned. A new traitor – Uriel – has now taken his place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Utterly defeated, Dante doesn’t move until he notices the deepest parts of Hell being illuminated by golden light. The spirit of Saint Lucia, descending from Heaven, tells him something that changes everything: “Don’t fear, Dante. Even <em>this</em> is part of God’s plan.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The credits roll on Dante’s Inferno 2.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso - The Not-So-Complete Story</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more. Another internal document acquired by IGN outlines what God’s plan entails, and how it would have factored into the plot of the third game, Dante’s Inferno 3: Paradiso. Put simply, God’s plan is to destroy the Christian afterlife we’ve journeyed through, to tear down the unfair, overly strict system of punishment and redemption administered by Michael and his fellow angels, and establish a new order based purely on love.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember thinking that if Lucifer’s invasion is part of God’s plan, then that plan cannot result in the maintenance of the status quo,” says scriptwriter Joshua Rubin. “On the contrary, God saw his system corrupted by his angels, over-administered, overly bureaucratic. He wanted everything torn down, and the only way to do that was to make a man fight his way through it all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the aforementioned document, the war between Heaven and Hell would spread to Earth, with a large part of the third game taking place in medieval Florence. This time, it seems, it’s Dante – joined by his daughter, born while he was off on the crusades and left behind in Italy – who would have played the role of the invader, storming Paradise with an army of people and angels to fight Lucifer and save Beatrice one last time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those involved, looking back on the early development of Dante’s Inferno 2<em> </em>is bittersweet. On the one hand, the sequel, cancelled in its infancy, is a representation of lost potential, an invitation to imagine what could have been. “The number of games that don’t get a sequel but should,” Rubin muses. “It takes an entire game for a team to gel, to figure out how to work together. Often, it’s only in the second game where things really come to life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, the work that Visceral poured into the Dante franchise was not for nothing. While the sequel ended up in Limbo, the people who had worked on it went on to apply what they had learned to other projects, from Visceral’s Dead Space 3, to Uncharted 3 and God of War 2018. It is through these franchises – the very franchises that inspired Visceral – that the spirit of Dante’s Inferno lives on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While we’re still waiting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-buys-15-billion-stake-in-epic-games-to-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite">Disney and Epic Games’ connected universe to arrive in Fortnite,</a> a big step has been taken towards that goal as Disney Parks has arrived in Fortnite for the first time with Disneyland Game Rush. We had the chance to try out this Fortnite island, created with the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), and discovered it to be an incredibly authentic experience that celebrates Disneyland’s 70th anniversary through enjoyable yet forgettable mini-games and environments inspired by beloved attractions such as Haunted Mansion, Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland Game Rush is a limited-time offering in Fortnite that officially launches on November 6. You can simply search for the game title or jump right in by using the island code, 4617-4819-8826, to experience this new adventure for free.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/4k-disney-game-rush-1762349122702.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first enter Disneyland Game Rush and in-between mini-games, you are welcomed into an esplanade that is modeled after the one between Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, complete with the 70th anniversary castle structure in the middle. On the perimeter, you can see Sleeping Beauty Castle, Haunted Mansion, Pixar Pier, the Matterhorn, and more, and all of these pieces make a very visually appealing Disney puzzle that I loved exploring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also open up presents that are each inspired by attractions or Nighttime Spectaculars, participate in Disneyland trivia for points, trade in the tokens you’ve earned in the mini-games for island-exclusive Disneyland 70th-inspired cosmetics like Mickey Ears, a Spider-Bot hat, the head of a Disneyland 70th-themed R2-D2, and even a Hatbox Ghost Back Bling, among others. One of my favorite touches is that you can find one Disneyland Key in each land and redeem it for a golden version of these cosmetics. For those unfamiliar, the Disneyland Key is a physical toy key you can use on locks around Disneyland during its 70th anniversary celebration, and it is represented here in a clever, fun way.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/01-disneyland-game-rush-hub-1762349167749.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the mini-games, there are seven that you and up to 11 others can randomly compete in, and they are Disney Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt, Matterhorn: Slip-and-Climb, Space Mountain: Rocket Race, Indiana Jones: Tomb Runner, Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Sneakout!, Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown, and WEB Slingers: Spider-Bot Blaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt was my favorite of the bunch, as it gives me an excuse to run through the spooky halls of one of my favorite attractions with a flashlight and a freedom you don’t have on the real thing. It also gets many bonus points for starting with the Stretching Room with that iconic welcome speech and paintings that are Fortnite versions of the real thing. While there really isn’t an objective besides collecting coins, it just made me smile so much with Grim Grinning Ghosts blasting through my speakers while I stumbled upon the Dining Room and got to dance with a group of ghosts that included Peely.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/06-haunted-mansion-scavenger-haunt-1762349167749.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Disney Haunted Mansion: Scavenger Haunt. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown was my next favorite, as it put you aboard a First Order Star Destroyer and tasked you with taking down as many Stormtroopers as you can. This was made even more fun as you could take on Kylo Ren and Captain Phasma and, if you defeat them, you can take their weapons as your own. There are even lightsabers hidden around the level, which is always a welcome addition. Fans of Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance will be happy to know the AT-ATs and laser cannon can be found as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/10-star-wars-stormtrooper-showdown-1762349167750.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: Stormtrooper Showdown. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’d place Matterhorn: Slip-and-Climb third because it is perhaps the most chaotic. You have to climb the Matterhorn with a Grappler, but the twist is that your feet become blocks of ice when you do. It’s fun to swing and climb up the face of the mountain, but there was a lot of slipping, falling, and friends hilariously soaring down next to you in agony. Once I got the hang of it, though, it was an enjoyable experience with some good strategy thrown in, especially when I swung right into a Disneyland Key!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/04-matterhorn-slip-and-climb-1762349167749.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Matterhorn: Slip-and-Climb. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Guardians of the Galaxy - Mission: Sneakout! takes spot number four in large part because it began with the welcome surprise of Jackson 5’s I Want You Back. What followed was a 2D adventure through a space prison where you had to avoid guards and make it to the Collector’s office on the top level. There were some nice touches in this level, with the Milano floating outside and the ability to throw Boogie Bombs at guards and friends to make them dance, but it wasn’t particularly exciting and the guards took you out way too fast.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/08-guardians-of-the-galaxy-mission-sneakout-1762349167749.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Guardians of the Galaxy: Mission: Sneakout! Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones: Tomb Runner was next, and it’s a race through a trap-filled level that features a ton of nods to Indy’s adventures, including giant boulders, spikes coming from the floor, and poison darts being launched from the walls. There are also speed boosts you can get to help you on your mission, but anytime you touch a hazard, you slow down. It was tough to get good momentum as the traps seemed very tricky to avoid, but maybe I’m just not yet very good at being a treasure hunter.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/09-indiana-jones-tomb-runner-1762349167749.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones: Tomb Runner. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">WEB Slingers: Spider-Bot Blaster was second last for me, even though I loved how the team used the same models and animations as the Spider-Bots in WEB Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure in DCA. It’s a shooting gallery with multiplying Spider-Bots - normal ones, golden ones, and even a giant boss one - but it’s not as engaging, as you are mostly standing still in a window and shooting bots and exploding barrels instead of running and jumping all over the place.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/07-web-slingers-spider-bot-blaster-1762349167749.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">WEB Slingers: Spider-Bot Blaster. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, we have Space Mountain: Rocket Race. I love how this mini-game starts in a space modeled after the actual attraction, but the mini-game itself is just grinding on rails for a couple of minutes. The sense of speed is nice and I do love that classic Space Mountain music, but it didn’t feel like I really had control of whether I was winning or losing and I fell off a few times and had to wait for a respawn while I was slowly gliding down into nothingness.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/11-space-mountain-rocket-race-1762349167750.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Space Mountain: Rocket Race. Image Credit: Disney</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, these mini-games are fun distractions and I’m very excited to bring my friends with me into this experience until we can reunite at the real Disneyland. Unfortunately, I can’t imagine coming back to them after the luster of living in these incredibly well-done homages to some of Disneyland’s top attractions wears off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this does most of all, however, is make me even more excited for this partnership between Disney and Epic. As someone who has extensively covered Disney and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disneyland-70th-anniversary-reasons-to-visit">visited Disneyland during its 70th anniversary celebration,</a> I think they captured the feel of these attractions and parks in a very special way. I mean, there are even popcorn carts hanging about, a railroad circling the hub area, and a party at the end where you can dance with Mickey in his 70th-anniversary best.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Disneyland Game Rush, despite its name, doesn’t feel like a game that was rushed. It feels like a project lovingly created by Disney to celebrate Disneyland’s big milestone and give fans a way to celebrate even if they can’t make it out to Anaheim. While I hope they can improve the actual gameplay of these Disney experiences in the future, I couldn’t be happier with how faithfully Disney Parks has been brought into Fortnite for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

                <p>New images for a "Cross-Buy" system have been spotted on the PlayStation Store, sparking speculation that Sony might be looking to introduce cross-platform purchasing of some kind in the future. The graphics for this were spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985841552288104906" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amethxst</a> on X and corroborated by reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p><p>According to Dealabs, the Cross-Buy tags were added by Sony all the way back in June 2025, but what the company's definition of this term could be is unknown. For comparison, Microsoft offers a cross-buy feature where Xbox games can be played on PC, (sometimes) through cloud streaming, or anything else that it considers to be an Xbox--like the ROG Ally X handheld.</p><p>Could Sony offer a similar deal, considering that it has made more of its first-party games available on PC after a period of exclusivity on PS5? That's unknown, but it is worth pointing out that Sony previously used Cross-Buy as a term for games sold during the PS Vita handheld era. If PS3 or PS4 owners purchased certain games back then, they'd get the PS Vita for free and vice versa, allowing them access to one game over multiple platforms. The service was eventually phased out, but at the time, it was a major draw for PS Vita owners.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">With a PS5 Portable handheld also rumored to be in development</a>, having some form of cross-buy that links both home and handheld consoles could be a way to drum up interest in that potential hardware.</p><p>While it remains to be seen what form Cross-Buy takes--if Sony pushes ahead with it--fans of the PS Portal handheld can look forward to a major update for that streaming device. After a year in beta, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps-portal-update-adds-full-cloud-streaming-two-years-after-launch/1100-6535944/">Cloud Streaming for the PS Portal</a> has officially "arrived" and is open to all PS Plus Premium subscribers. The game library for Cloud Streaming has expanded to almost 3,000 games, and several new features have been added to help users play games in different streaming modes.</p>

            <div property="schema:text"><p>Flameo! Magic: The Gathering's <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> set is dropping soon, bringing the journey of Aang and the gang to life in booster packs and drafts around the world. Wizards of the Coast offered us the opportunity to reveal some cards in the upcoming set, both new and familiar.</p><p>Our new card is leaning into the "Ally" creature type, as well as multi-colored deckbuilding. The Earthen Ally is a humble 0/2 for one Green mana, gaining power for each color among Allies you control. Heck, you can pay a whopping 2 plus WUBRG (that's one of each color of mana, plus an additional two mana) to Earthbend 5. (Earthbend is a new keyword that makes your lands attackers, essentially.)</p><p>We also have a batch of additional cards, which are reprinted versions of past Magic: The Gathering cards. Meteorite, Sunbaked Canyon, Treetop Village, Volcanic Torrent, and Warstorm Surge all get their own animated adaptations here in the cards. I like having a new Sunbaked Canyon to put in my Boros deck, and Treetop is a fun, classic reprint that lines up well with the Earthbending archetype.</p><p>It certainly looks like Magic: The Gathering is doing some fun things with its adaptation of <em>Avatar</em>. The full set will arrive on November 21, with pre-release events kicking off the weekend prior on November 14.</p></div>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> launched in full on Steam yesterday, and has been met with "mostly negative" reviews from users of the popular PC gaming platform.</p>
<p>As of writing, 5,224 users of submitted reviews are readable on the game's store page. 3,902 are negative reviews, with complaints covering UI gripes, bugs and technical issues, and a samey gameplay experience that clashes against the ambitious evolution of the series promised in the lead up to launch.</p>
<p>Currently voted the most helpful negative review on the game,<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/spittfooyer/recommended/3551340/"> user Spittfire</a> already has roughly 60 hours invested into Football Manager 26. In their review, they note their mixed feelings about the UI, a major part of the Football Manager experience: "The UI overhaul certainly is visually impressive at first glance but really creates a clunky experience when playing the game and navigating through different menus and pages."</p>

<p>They did, however, praise the tactics overhaul, a feature that has received widespread praise among early adopters: "I have always enjoyed the tactical side of the game, and FM 26 has introduced a new level of freedom to tactical-minded managers. While some of the player position terminology is a bit clunky (still better than the outdated terms used before), the overall tactical enhancements are clear."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-play-football-manager-26-now-in-early-access-if-you-pre-order-on-pc">Football Manager 26 was released into Early Access late last month</a>, which allowed keen football fans to give it a spin and come to their own conclusions ahead of the full launch this week. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/brace-yourselves-football-manager-fans-ive-played-a-day-of-fm26-and-its-going-to-take-a-lot-of-getting-used-to">In our own preview</a>, Eurogamer editor Chris Tapsell emphasised it would "take a lot of getting used to". Perhaps this and other previews were omens of this initial reception from the masses.</p>
<p>Here's hoping Sports Interactive can turn this negative public opinion around in the coming weeks and months.</p>

<p>One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 released back in 2020, and in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/27/one-piece-pirate-warriors-4-review/">One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 review,&nbsp;</a>Miguel said, <em>“One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is a fan’s dream game, as it takes the iconic battles and moments of eight major story arcs and puts you right in the action like never before. Combat is fun and flashy while still managing to be surprisingly thoughtful, and although a few characters aren’t a joy to control, a majority of the cast is an absolute delight to play as. One Piece Pirate Warriors 4 is a jolly good time.”</em></p>
<p>While new content is good to see for an older game, fans may be wanting to see One Piece Warriors 5 in the near future.</p>

		<p>Konami and developer ZDT Studio have released a new gameplay trailer for the side scrolling adventure game Darwin’s Paradox, in which players take control of a very intelligent octopus. The new trailer also brings with it two bits of news. First, Darwin’s Paradox has been delayed to 2026 and no specific release window has been given. Second, Darwin’s Paradox will be coming to Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darwin’s Paradox! | Gameplay Trailer | KONAMI (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FF8l7UJox-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new gameplay trailer for Darwin’s Paradox shows our heroic blue octopus navigate his way around a large industrial area after being taken from his home in the ocean. Players are going to have to use Darwin’s skills to navigate dangerous locations and evade people who will try to capture him, using skills like walking on ceilings and camouflage. The trailer shows various threats Darwin will have to deal with including factories full of fire, rats, and what appears to be quite a hungry seagull.</p>
<p>Darwin’s Paradox will be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e19b094b29201"><a title="Nintendo Firework" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e19b094b29201/nintendo-firework.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><blockquote>
<p>"Remember remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason, and an excuse to talk about 'Jump Up, Super Star!' again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a rhyme that we Brits are all familiar with (at least, words to that effect), because here it's Guy Fawkes Night. Or Bonfire Night, if you prefer.</p>
<p>On 5th November every year, we gather in cold, wet fields and back gardens across the country to witness firework displays of varying qualities — everything from a town council splashing out with the end-of-year budget to a wobbly dad navigating the flower pots with a damp sparkler in hand. In short, today's the perfect day to talk all things that go "<em>weeeeeeiiiii BANG!!!</em>"</p>
<p>In the absence of retelling the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot again (if you need a reminder, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXgVldv9ls4">baby-faced Alex</a> told it through the medium of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a> back in 2015), we've started thinking about our favourite game fireworks.</p>
<p>A quick search through our libraries revealed that there are, actually, quite a lot of rather good fireworks sequences. We quickly realised that the bonfires would have long petered out if we tried to put together an exhaustive list of 'Every Firework Sequence in Video Games', but let's pick out some of our favourites.</p>
<p>Get your "oooh"s and "aaahh"s at the ready...</p>
<h2>Our Favourite Video Game Fireworks</h2>
<p>The following are presented in no particular order, but we'll kick things off with the first moment that <em>jumped</em> to mind...</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> - 'A Traditional Festival!'</h3>
<figure data-uuid="a2daab4bb1806"><a title="Mario Odyssey Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2daab4bb1806/mario-odyssey-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might have been too busy tapping your toes to the immensely catchy 'Jump Up, Super Star!' or quietly shedding a tear at the nostalgic beauty of it all, but Mario Odyssey's masterful 'A Traditional Festival!' sequence has fireworks lighting up the New Donk City night throughout.</p>
<p>A stunning part of a stunning game.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> - Fireworks Festival</h3>
<figure data-uuid="c1e8a17e341ff"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1e8a17e341ff/animal-crossing-new-horizons-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fireworks weren't in Animal Crossing: New Horizons at launch, which made their inclusion in the 1.4.0 Summer Update all the more exciting.</p>
<p>Come on, try to tell us that you <em>didn't</em> squeal on the first Sunday in August 2020 when you saw one of your custom designs pop up in the night sky.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_party">Wii Party</a> - 'Lucky Launch'</h3>

<p>Not all Wii Party minigames are based on skill, and 'Lucky Launch' is certainly one of the less taxing options. But doesn't that make it all the more exciting? You pick a firework, almost at random, and watch it soar into the sky, hoping it explodes last. That's it. No skill, no challenge, just good vibes.</p>
<p>The winner even gets to see their Mii's face immortalised in the bright coloured light show, which is... not as creepy as it sounds.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> - Flagpole</h3>
<figure data-uuid="bf5c8c8e2f2a8"><a title="Super Mario Bros. Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf5c8c8e2f2a8/super-mario-bros-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>They're perhaps not the most visually impressive fireworks by today's standards, but we distinctly remember timing our final jumps with the level countdown so we could see them in action. (The timer has to finish with a one, three, or six at the end to set off that number of fireworks, kids.)</p>
<p>Super Mario Bros. is where it all started, obviously, but we'd be lying if we said that we haven't done the same with every 2D entry since.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> - 'Greatest Jubilee'</h3>

<p>Getting the 'Greatest Jubilee' fireworks weapon in Vampire Survivors is no mean feat, consisting of lots of unlocks and a particularly nasty boss battle. When you do have it, however, you'll see the true potential of an overly crowded screen.</p>
<p>This is a game that can look busy at the best of times, so just imagine what it's like with colourful explosives thrown into the mix!</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/kirbys_return_to_dream_land">Kirby's Return to Dream Land</a> - Crackler</h3>
<figure data-uuid="98d6ec6940e35"><a title="Kirby's Return to Dream Land Crackler" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/98d6ec6940e35/kirbys-return-to-dream-land-crackler.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We love just about any projectile weapon in a Kirby game, but one that fires cannonballs, which explode into colourful fireworks on impact? That rules.</p>
<p>Our fondest memories of the Crackler come from Kirby's Return to Dream Land, but you'll also find it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Air Ride</a> (and soon in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Air Riders</a>) as well as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kirby_triple_deluxe">Triple Deluxe</a> and the other <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/kirby_fighters_2">Fighters</a> games. What a beauty.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro: Year of the Dragon</a> - 'Fireworks Factory'</h3>

<p>Okay, part of us feels like this is cheating a little, since Spyro 3's 'Fireworks Factory' isn't strictly speaking all that much about fireworks.</p>
<p>However, it is probably the best level in the game, and it sees Spyro gobbling up fireworks and using them as weapons against enemies. That's enough to be worthy of inclusion.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> - 'The Fireworks Artist'</h3>
<figure data-uuid="f957c95913a34"><a title="Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Fireworks" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f957c95913a34/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-fireworks.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the grand scheme of Echoes of Wisdom side content, 'The Fireworks Artist' is pretty low-tier, but it does result in a super sweet Echo.</p>
<p>In it, you help a Goron firework maker, Basa, see in the new chief in style with a fireworks display. It's a simple little fetch quest that doesn't take all that much thinking, but once it's done, you can learn to summon fireworks at will, and who wouldn't want to do that?</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> - 'Words Drowned by Fireworks'</h3>

<p>With <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_vii_rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> heading to Switch 2 at some point down the line, we won't go into all the reasons why this moment is so iconic. If you know, you know; if you don't, you're in for a treat.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> - N64 Rainbow Road</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cdf0357944dc9"><a title="Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cdf0357944dc9/mario-kart-8-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Debate what the best Rainbow Road track is as much as you'd like, the N64 version is always going to be right up there. Why? Because it has funny little fireworks of every character exploding in the sky as you drive. That's why.</p>
<p>Okay, there are some other reasons, but none are quite as relevant to this list.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y</a> - Parfum Palace</h3>

<p>Pokémon X &amp; Y has a surprising number of genuinely touching moments, and the Parfum Palace fireworks sequence is one of them. Shauna opens up about how she wants to remember the show forever (either because she's never watched fireworks with a boy before or because she wants to remain "great friends", depending on which avatar you pick), and the twinkly piano keys help sell it.</p>
<p>If you happened to catch the sequence at night, you're in for a great show. If you watch it in the day... ehhhh, not so much.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/big_bang_mini">Big Bang Mini</a></h3>

<p>Oh, you thought we'd make it through this list without mentioning the DS shmup, Big Bang Mini? It's literally a game all about fireworks!</p>
<p>It might not be the best shoot 'em up out there, but we're hard pushed to think of a game with <em>more</em> firework displays to its name.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>That's some of our favourites, but which sits at your top spot? Do any of the above have your heart aglow, or have we missed a big hitter? How many shoot 'em ups with more impressive pyrotechnic displays can you name? Let us know in the following poll and the comments, Guys.</em></p>
