            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Borderlands 4</em>&nbsp;narrative director Sam Winkler has revealed that he intends to tone down what he identifies as an "overabundance of toilet humor" in the series' previous game.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1868741632449036648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to a follower</a> on social media platform X, Winkler says that while he's "not at liberty" to discuss the narrative content of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>at the moment, he remains "firm" in his "criticism of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>'s overabundance of toilet humor".</p>

<p>Another&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>fan then humorously asks Winkler if they'll be able to "use the poop poop farty 4000" to "clean up porta-potties with my companion skibidi toilet", which is a sentence that physically hurt me to write, even though I'm quoting someone else's sarcastic observation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=Ey-BmeCK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-toilet-humor-narrative-director-psycho.jpg?itok=wbmQTnEb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will focus less on "toilet humor", its narrative director says.</figcaption></figure><p>In response to this painfully-worded question (for which props must begrudgingly go to the post's writer Moxsy), Winkler says that while he can't guarantee there will be "no toilets", he'll "cry real tears" if "the word skibidi ships in the game".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that writer Paul Tassi joked&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>would feature a gun called "Hawk 2A" (a reference to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/06/28/hawk-tuah-meme-explained-how-woman-in-viral-interview-made-a-reported-65000-and-prompted-tiktok-craze/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the famous Hawk Tuah meme</a>) and that this suggestion prompted a fellow dev to ask if that gun was real.</p>

<p>That question, Winkler said, made him want to "put [his] hand down the sink grinder", so it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>will also de-emphasize the kind of meme humor for which the series has become known.</p>

<p>With all of that said, the thread originally began with Winkler praising&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s contract writers as "some of the funniest people [he knows]", so the game definitely won't be a serious grimdark take on the series.</p>




<p>The first gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was revealed during this year's Game Awards, alongside the likes of an&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow"><em>Okami&nbsp;</em>sequel</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">co-op survival spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and Naughty Dog's new game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a>.</p>

<p>Gearbox describes the game as a "mayhem-fueled looter shooter" packed with "billions of weapons, outrageous enemies, and intense co-op action", which sounds about right for the&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is set to come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, pit you and your friends against&nbsp;enemies from the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>series, game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu interview</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>), Ishizaki says that some&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will appear to fight you in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, although it seems like there won't be too many; the game's enemy roster will largely be made up of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>enemies, Ishizaki says.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he got permission from&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>creator Hidetaka Miyazaki and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>director Yui Tanimura to include enemies from their respective works in <i>Nightreign</i>, so it looks like you can expect&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2&nbsp;</em>enemies alongside iconic foes from the other two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=cMqza9I9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-combat.jpg?itok=4l-M7hwg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>will feature&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies, as well as those found in the original&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Eagle-eyed observers had already spotted&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s Nameless King boss in the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>debut trailer, as well as a boss that looked suspiciously like&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>' Centipede Demon, and now it looks like those won't be the only&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>callbacks in the game.</p>

<p>Ishizaki doesn't mention whether any&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies will be appearing in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, but given that the&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>IP is owned by Sony and not by FromSoftware or Bandai Namco, it's unlikely.</p>

<p>As for why&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>enemies turn up in&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>, Ishizaki's answer is rather amusing; he puts it down to the influence of the game's villain, the Night King, which rather smacks of "a wizard did it" to me.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming co-op survival action game created by FromSoftware and based on the 2022 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">smash hit</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>




<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards ceremony last week</a>,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>eschews FromSoftware's typical Soulslike formula, opting instead for a sort of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>-inspired roguelite approach that sees players banding together to survive three days and nights of increasingly difficult encounters.</p>

<p>The game's announcement came less than two weeks after FromSoftware head Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">said there were no plans</a> to expand the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>IP in the future, but then his games are well-known for featuring duplicitous or obscure NPCs, so perhaps we shouldn't be surprised.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010877" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox.</p>

Several heroes’ ultimate abilities have a brief startup animation before they get real crazy and can’t be stopped. Characters with crowd control abilities, like Wolverine and Peni Parker, can stop most ults if they strike just before the enemy executes the attack, and doing so will often come down to the stars aligning. The ability can’t be on cooldown, of course, and you have to have the perfect line of sight to strike. But if you’re going to play heroes who have that utility, it’s a good skill to have in your arsenal.</p><p>A lot of these shutdowns will become second nature as you memorize ultimate voice lines and are on the receiving end of every attack. Anticipating when your foe’s about to drop theirs is a big part of canceling a possible team wipe. This also comes with time, as you’ll get a sense of when enemies have likely racked up enough damage or healing to charge their ultimate. Then you’ll know what positioning to look for as enemies set up their attacks. You’ll see an Iron Man who tries to flank your team to surprise you with an Invincible Pulse Cannon, for instance, or Thor leaping into the air before he slams his hammer down. You can spend some time in the training range to see what abilities you can actually stop, but nothing will replace the practice of getting into casual matches and trying them out naturally. Then you’ll be ready to take those skills into competitive play.</p><p>For more on <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">check out <em>Kotaku</em>’s review</a></span>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox owners could be getting their hands on more PlayStation-exclusive games in 2025. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/inside-the-risky-strategy-that-will-define-xboxs-next-decade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Jez Corden of Windows Central, sources have told him that there will be “more unannounced and previously PlayStation-exclusive games” coming to Xbox Series X|S next year. </p>



<p>News of PlayStation exclusives coming to Xbox shouldn’t surprise anyone. Over recent years, both sides have continued to release games on the competing platforms. Recently, Genshin Impact finally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genshin-impact-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made its debut</a> on Xbox after being console exclusive to PlayStation since 2020. Another PlayStation exclusive,&nbsp;Predator: Hunting Grounds, released on Xbox in 2024 after four years as a Sony exclusive.</p>



<p>As of now, it’s unclear if Corden is referring to first-party or third-party games making their way to Microsoft’s consoles.</p>



<p>On the other side of the coin, Microsoft is bringing exclusives like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> to PlayStation 5 in 2025. There are also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-was-ready-but-delayed-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored plans</a> for Forza Horizon 5 to make its way to the console as well.</p>



<p>What PlayStation games do you think will make their way to Xbox Series X|S in 2025? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/more-playstation-exclusives-are-coming-to-xbox-next-year-its-claimed.1331/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-dev-seemingly-teases-snoop-dogg-appearance-in-project-century<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza / Like a Dragon developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio appears to be teasing a Snoop Dogg appearance in its mysterious new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/project-century-rgg">Project Century</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RGG Studio posted a photo of Snoop wearing the distinctive jacket worn by the protagonist in the Project Century trailer. At the same time, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama posted a photo of himself in the jacket, mirroring the pose of Snoop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Snoop photo has the teasing caption "...yet," while Yokoyama's, in Japanese, said: "please wait a bit, yeah?" It's not the tease RGG Studio fans were expecting of Project Century, which appears to be a new series potentially connected to Yakuza / Like a Dragon but set in 1915, given it was only revealed at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-everything-announced">The Game Awards 2024</a> a few days ago, but there are some elements which aren't completely bizarre.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="und" dir="ltr">"...yet." <a href="https://t.co/PZVRac0ag9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PZVRac0ag9</a></p>— RGG Studio | Like a Dragon &amp; Yakuza Series (@RGGStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/RGGStudio/status/1868824408225382702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop was also at The Game Awards 2024, for example, where he performed a medley of songs to the developers and press in attendance. It's therefore likely the photo was taken there, and could be as simple as him liking the jacket and wanting a photo in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn't the first time Snoop Dogg's name has been brought up in relation to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon series. Following on from Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, which featured Danny Trejo as the likeness and voice for villain Dwight Méndez, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-asks-yakuzalike-a-dragon-fans-if-they-want-celebs-like-keanu-reeves-and-mark-hamill-in-next-game">publisher Sega asked fans which other celebrities they'd like to appear</a> in the series going forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside video game adjacent stars such as Keanu Reeves, Mark Hamill, Jack Black, Rami Malek, and David Hayter came other celebrities, one of which was none other than Snoop Dogg. This tease could therefore be the end result of this poll, though nothing is confirmed yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snoop would likely appear as a new character and not just as a cameo of himself, especially if he does show up in Project Century since it's set 56 years before he was born. Little is known about the game, however, so anything is possible.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ちょっと待ってね <a href="https://t.co/N2hkLB5Z53" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N2hkLB5Z53</a></p>— 横山昌義 (@yokoyama_masa) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokoyama_masa/status/1868823727687057888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-like-a-dragon-fans-are-already-theorizing-what-the-heck-rgg-studios-project-century-is">RGG Studio fans are already deep in the theorizing phase to figure out what the heck Project Century is</a>, of course, and already have ideas on where it's set, if it's connected to the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, who it's main character is, and if it's using the developer's Dragon Engine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They'll have to be patient for these answers though. Project Century is probably still a while away given it doesn't have a title yet, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-set-to-take-on-street-fighter-and-tekken-once-again-with-virtua-fighter-the-game-awards-2024">RGG Studio is currently developing Virtua Fighter 6</a> and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii alongside it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is known for its unbelievably speedy development times, however. In the last five years, for example, its released Yakuza 4 Remastered, Yakuza 5 Remastered, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Judgment Remastered, Lost Judgment, Like a Dragon: Ishin, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, alongside three Super Monkey Ball Games and an enhanced remaster of Virtua Fighter 5. That's 12 games in total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last RGG Studio release</a>, IGN said: "Sprawling, enthralling, and packed with dynamic brawling, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth isn’t just the best turn-based Like a Dragon game, it’s one of the greatest games in the entire series."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-admits-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-anti-cheat-did-not-hit-the-mark-at-the-launch-of-season-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision has outlined the steps it’s taken to combat cheating in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 after Ranked Mode came under fire by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ranked, Black Ops 6’s most competitive Multiplayer mode, began November 21 but<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-cheat-complaints-ramp-up-activision-says-its-doing-hourly-sweeps-to-stem-the-tide"> reaction so far has been largely negative</a>. This is because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Activision’s Team Ricochet, the division responsible for its Call of Duty anti-cheat tech, admitted not enough had been done to prevent cheating with the launch of Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After a series of updates our systems are in a better place today across all modes; however, we did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 01 — particularly for Ranked Play,” Activision said. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said account bans are now happening hourly due to increased “velocity” from several Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, in addition to the over 19,000 accounts it’s removed recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cleanup of the Ranked leaderboards, which has suffered greatly from cheaters, is now faster, Activision said. And Activision has “significantly expanded” its Replay Investigation render farm (the machines used to generate clips for examination.) The company said it’s also ramped up the group dedicated to manually reviewing clips based on a priority order that favors detections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the last several weeks, the Replay tool updates have been highly effective at validating detections and reports, providing further training for AI systems for the anti-cheat team, and removing cheaters,” Activision added.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision also promised more updates to come for its Ricochet Anti-Cheat systems, including its kernel-level driver and brand-new server-side protections. These are set to launch during Season 2 and 3. In the meantime, Activision encouraged players to enable 2FA on their account, and report cheaters in-game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The things you work so hard to earn (Ranked Play status, camos, etc.) are attractive targets to cheaters who want nice things but don’t like to put in the work,” Activision said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Ricochet Anti-Cheat team will be continuing its work to fight cheaters throughout the remainder of the month. While we have made progress, we know more needs to be done and we’re eager to share details of our planned major updates coming in the new year.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Activision anti-cheat updates are met with a healthy dose of scepticism from hardcore fans, and this latest one is no different. Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputation issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match"><u>it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</u></a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applied to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly — they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

		<p>NetEase Games and Marvel has announced that Marvel Rivals’ first seasonal event will be starting on December 20th, and it is called Winter Celebration. This event will add a new limited time 4v4 mode called Jeff’s Winter Splash Festival, where everyone plays as Jeff in what looks like a mode inspired by Splatoon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Winter Celebration, Joyful Jubilation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Be5Err7ygLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Marvel Rivals Winter Celebration will allow all players to unlock items like the Jeff the Land Shark: Cuddly Fuzzlefin costume, nameplate, and spray by completing certain objectives. Other Winter themed costumes are going to be added to the Marvel Rivals too, though these cannot be unlocked for free by the looks of things. Groot, Rocket, Venom, and Magik are all getting these winter themed costumes.</p>

<p>While we haven’t review Marvel Rivals, Nick did play it before release and in his preview wrote, “Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I’m gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.”</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals did launch on December 6th, and it is living up to some of its potential as a multiplayer shooter. You can play it for free now.</p>

		<p>No, probably not. And why would you? </p><p>Technically speaking, we announced these <a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/?ref=remapradio.com">new additions to <em>Remap</em>’s merch store</a> during Save Point, where we donated any profits to Save Point’s donation total, but didn’t actually publish anything on the website. Or share details on social media. We are, in theory, a business.</p><p>But it’s true!</p><p>We have two new items in the <em>Remap</em> store, and think they're awesome. Every time we add an item, we use it ourselves before you can buy it. It'd be easy to flood our store with junk—but we try not to.</p><p>How can you engage in a little capitalism with us? Glad you asked:</p><figure></figure><h3 id="shaker-pint-glass-aka-beer-storage-%E2%80%94-2350"><a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/store/p/shaker-pint-glass?ref=remapradio.com">Shaker pint glass (aka beer storage)</a> — $23.50</h3><blockquote><em>Enjoy your refreshing drinks in this shaker pint glass! It can hold up to 16 oz and will be a durable, high-quality addition to your glassware collection. What’s more, you can even use it as a mixing glass for cocktail evenings.&nbsp;</em></blockquote><figure></figure><h3 id="gaming-mouse-pad-aka-desk-mat-%E2%80%94-3995"><a href="https://dogfish-seadragon-f2ms.squarespace.com/store/p/gaming-mouse-pad?ref=remapradio.com"><strong>Gaming mouse pad (aka desk mat)</strong></a><strong> — </strong>$39.95</h3><blockquote><em>With its large size and quality edge stitching, this gaming mouse pad turns your gaming setup into a professional gaming station ready for Dota, CSGO, and more. Don’t worry about jerky mouse movements ever again, as the under layer features a reliable non-slip surface that keeps the entire mat firmly rooted to your table.</em></blockquote><p>You’ll still be able to buy these after the end of 2024, of course. </p><p>But why not now?</p>

<p>One of the most popular memes is making its way to Fortnite as Skibidi Toilet is coming to the game. According to Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, a Skibidi Toilet bundle will be available in the game starting on Wednesday, December 18.</p>



<p>Players will be able to buy the full bundle for 2,800 VBucks or a la carte. The main piece of the bundle is a Plungerman skin for 1500 VBucks that includes a LEGO variant and a Skibidi backpack. Also available is a Skibidi Toilet backpack for 600 Vbucks and a Plungerman’s Plunger pickaxe for 800 Vbucks.</p>



<p>As of publishing, Epic Games has yet to confirm the release of the bundle. If and when that happens, this article will be updated with full details.</p>



<p>The continued growth of Skibidi Toilet shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone. Earlier this year it was announced that a Skibidi Toilet TV show and movie were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skibidi-toilet-movie-and-tv-show-are-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the works at a major studio</a>.</p>

                <p>Disney Speedstorm is finally starting to get characters from Moana, with the addition of the demigod Maui as a playable racer. The trailer shows off the Speedstorm makeover for the character with his own racing suit and themed car, along with a handful of his special moves.</p><p>As you might expect, Maui is a Trickster class. Tricksters have more Boost than other classes, and can gain nitro fuel by drifting. They also tend to get skills like Hack or Bomb. Maui's unique skill is called Hero to All. The standard version uses his magical fishhook to deliver a huge explosion, while in the charged version, he shapeshifts into a hawk to counterattack and speed past opponents.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney Speedstorm - Exclusive Maui Racer Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The trailer notes that Maui is available now, and teases that Moana herself will be coming soon too. Like Maui, she appears to have gotten her own Speedstorm makeover and car, with a similar appearance to Maui's. Her skills were not detailed in this trailer.</p><p>Disney Speedstorm is a kart racer featuring characters from across a wide swath of Disney properties--the Mickey Mouse family of characters, animated films like Frozen and Toy Story, live-action movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, and even tangential properties like the Muppets. New seasons rotate in roughly every month, and the current season features five characters from The Incredibles films: Mr. Incredible, Mrs. Incredible, Violet, Dash, and Frozone.</p>

It has a simple interface, is easy to understand, features no ads, and is free to play. Guess a five-letter word in six tries, come back the next day for another. So when it was released in October 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, it caught on very quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just a few months later, The New York Times bought it for a price "in the low seven figures." A few years later, it's still a gigantic hit, having been played more than 4.8 billion times in 2023 alone. It's so big that when the organization's tech union went on strike in November 2024, workers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://nytimesguild.org/tech/guild-builds/">made versions of its game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">s, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, that users could play instead of crossing the picket line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s massive popularity is just one inflection point in the history of newspaper games—typically word or number puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku, and other games you play once per day. These kinds of games have been popular for over a century, and almost every mainstream subscription publication you can think of has their own.&nbsp;</span></p><p>via New York Times</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there was something about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">that made publications and platforms take notice. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pinpoint-queens-crossclimb-game-lakshman-somasundaram-k1zwc/">LinkedIn launched</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> three "thinking-oriented games" in May 2024, while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/cinematrix-vulture-movie-trivia-grid-game.html">Vulture unveiled Cinematrix</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a grid-based movie trivia guessing game, in February. Subscription-based games platform Puzzmo launched in late 2023, offering standard fare like crosswords along with experimental endeavors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-Up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, an oddly satisfying and challenging combination of poker and Sudoku. It was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hearst.com/-/hearst-newspapers-acquires-puzzle-games-platform-puzzmo">acquired by Hearst Newspapers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a couple months later, and can be played across multiple websites like the San Francisco Chronicle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wardle says </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s success is tied to its simplicity. "I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">he told the New York Times</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "It's something that encourages you to spend three minutes a day… Like, it doesn’t want any more of your time than that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experts interviewed for this article agree on this… to a point. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a simple yet effective game that appeals to almost everyone. However, it also benefited from great timing, releasing during a pandemic where people were aching for community in a world where building it felt impossible, and showed what still needed to be done to push daily games to the next level. It was time for a change.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is The New York Times a gaming company?">Is The New York Times a gaming company?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The leader in the newspaper games space is undoubtedly the New York Times. Its crossword is one of the most well known, and puzzle editor Will Shortz might be as close to a household name as puzzle editors get. It was already a huge draw before the publication bought </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and has become even more important in the age of digital subscriptions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As traditional publications struggle with subscriber counts and making a profit, the New York Times has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/315041/new-york-times-company-digital-subscribers/">increased its numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> almost every year since 2014. This is thanks in part to a bundle that costs $25 per month and packs in subscriptions for both its games app and the paper itself. Its investment into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is just one part of its growth strategy. As of November 2023, it had around 100 team members—up from around a dozen over the past decade—and has since hired more in community and design. “The half joke that is repeated internally is that The New York Times is now a gaming company that also happens to offer news," one anonymous staffer told </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/inside-the-new-york-times-big-bet-on-games">Vanity Fair</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You'd be forgiven for wanting to call the New York Times a gaming company. According to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/08/2024/the-new-york-times-is-testing-a-new-puzzle-called-zorse">Semafor</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the NYT Games app was downloaded more than 10 million times in 2023. But despite this success and growth, Times executive editor Joseph Kahn maintains it's not looking to create a games studio, telling Vanity Fair that the company is not "Activision, and I don’t think we’re looking to become that." "These are brainteaser games for smart people who want a challenge in the course of the day. So I see them as very complementary, but not replacement, products for a news organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times is very much a media organization first, but since buying </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it's launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which requires players to find four groups of words among 16 new ones each day. Semafor reports that it's been played around 2.3 billion times. It also released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strands</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game inspired by word searches, and is currently testing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zorse,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a phrase guessing game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It’s undeniable that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a big tipping point for us,” chief product officer Alex Hardiman told Vanity Fair. But “it’s not </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only. It’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> driving more attention to other games, allowing us to invest more in games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The pandemic's affect on daily games">The pandemic's affect on daily games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> massive popularity isn't the only reason for the rise in daily games. It was also spurred on in part by the pandemic, where people stuck inside with little to do were looking for a bit of routine to fill their day. Video game popularity and sales </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-world-turning-to-video-games-150704969.html">surged during the pandemic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/gaming/2020/03/28/video-games-whos-prescription-solace-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2932976001/">World Health Organization encouraging people</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to play games during lockdown. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> capitalized on that by being one of those tiny daily tasks. You solve one puzzle per day, and you're locked out until the next.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stella Zawistowski, a puzzle constructor for Vulture, the New Yorker, and other publications, says that the pandemic "accelerated" the daily games space because people were looking for something that "makes you feel a little smarter." </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also had a secret weapon: a feature that automatically created a colored grid of your results that you could copy onto Twitter/X or a group message.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I don't think [</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] would have been successful if you could just play as many times as you want every day," Zawistowski said. "I don't think it would have been nearly as successful if you couldn't post your score on Insta, on Twitter, on Facebook because then it gets people talking about it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That community building is one of video games' greatest strengths, and that's all the more relevant with daily games. The New York Times has been slowly building up community, adding stats to its games and allowing people to join forums (although they're mostly just links to comment sections), but its success is often in spite of its lack of features. So many people play New York Times games, and there are a lot of chances to go viral. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Connections </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">has become a viral hit in certain circles thanks to the chaotic nature of some of the solutions (a long running joke about how users see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://slate.com/life/2024/07/connections-nyt-today-wordle-wyna-liu.html">editor Wyna Liu as their nemesis</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been the subject of many TikToks and memes). That's why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> co-creator Zach Gage believes that it doesn't have a lot to offer for many online players.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Their platform is terrible," Gage said. "It's terrible in the sense that it is non-existent. Their platform is a website with a bunch of links to games, and then you go and play the games, and the games don't really interact with that website where you started."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage noted that during the pandemic, he noticed that his wife was playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Words with Friends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a mobile, multiplayer version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scrabble</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, with family through multiple group chats. I see something similar among people who play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Even in 2024, I know people in group chats that are specifically for sharing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wordle </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If this was any other game that was big, there would be a social space that was connected to this game that everybody would just be able to enjoy… Why isn't there a social space for players like that?" Gage said.</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gage, known for daily games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Really Bad Chess</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SpellTower</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, launched </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2023 with engineer Orta Therox not only as a place to house his games, but to fill a gap that the New York Times left behind in terms of community building. There are leaderboards, social features like friend requests, easy access to a Discord server where players and constructors gather, and daily announcements discussing how well people did on puzzles.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even LinkedIn noted the potential for games to connect people as its reasoning for adding daily games to its platform. You play one of the three four available at the time of this writing—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pinpoint, Queens</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossclimb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—then see which of your connections have played. You can also then head over to leaderboards or immediately hop into the official post to talk with other people. It's barebones, but it works as a little push to socialize over its games.</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">"You share your knowledge and get knowledge back, you share your experiences and hear about others’ own roads. And with games, you finish a puzzle and then talk about it with colleagues, friends, and distant connections," editor in chief and VP at LinkedIn said in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/bringing-professionals-together-games-daniel-roth-mxnfe/?trackingId=MdaPeLw5RO2vvQU%2Fvg5asg%3D%3D">games announcement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of an old format">The evolution of an old format</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It makes sense that the New York Times would be the market leader in the daily games space just due to age and brand recognition—it debuted in 1942, so it's had the time to build up a name for itself. But it's been making changes to keep it up to date for 2024. It's fallen behind in regards to community building, but it's been working on its reputation for being stodgy, traditional, highbrow, and almost completely inaccessible. The only way to get good at a New York Times crossword isn't to know random trivia, but to do them over and over again so you start learning the answers to favorite clues and notice patterns.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are better ways to do this, if you want them. A priority for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was to provide multiple difficulty experiences in one app. If you want to solve a crossword without any hints, you can. If you want to go for some extra sidequests in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pile-Up Poker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and engage further with a game's mechanics, you can do that as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via Puzzmo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing I've noticed is The New York Times tends to target either super high-end players or super low-end players," Gage said. "Their crossword is not very approachable for people who've never played a crossword, and their game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tiles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not very interesting for people who are really deep into games and want a deep experience… In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, our focus is on building games that work for anybody."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Puzzle constructor Brooke Husic leads the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crossword, which is a great example of this balancing act. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Puzzmo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> crosswords vary in terms of difficulty, but that's not defined by the obtuseness of the clues. The crossword allows you to use multiple hints before revealing the answer, and&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want somebody who's like, we have some of the best speed solvers in the world solving [the crossword] every day. And I want them to be there. I really want them to be there," Husic said. "But at the same time, I want someone who's never solved a crossroad before to go to post about any day and have it be their first crossword, and have a good experience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The New York Times, for what it's worth, has been making changes to increase the accessibility of its puzzles, specifically its crossword. Everdeen Mason became the newspaper's first editorial director of games in 2021, and she told Vanity Fair that while the Times had to maintain the difficulty it's known for, it wants to be more accessible for newer players. "If we’re asking people to pay for a product that’s primarily this thing that they can’t access, then that’s not very smart," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond the sheer amount of thematic variety out there that lets players choose which crosswords or games they might prefer, a more diverse array of constructors and editors have also been behind some of the most well-known puzzle sections. The New York Times is no longer run by purely white men; Mason is a black woman who dyes her hair, wears anime shirts in interviews,&nbsp; and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/insider/puzzles-director-mason.html">immediately wanted to challenge the team</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and "get people out of their comfort zones" with a Black History Month theme and more freelance constructors of different backgrounds.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zawistowski has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://paw.princeton.edu/article/crossword-constructors-are-mostly-male-heres-how-we-fix">written before</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about how crosswords are mostly constructed by men, and began her career struggling against that establishment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-chairman-masayuki-kato-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom founder and chairman Masayuki Kato has passed away at the age of 78, the studio has revealed. His cause of death has not been stated.</p>

<p>Per an announcement by Nihon Falcom (with translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1hg50yo/comment/m2gmzk3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Reddit user TheBlueDolphina</a>), Kato died on December 15th, which is also when he "resigned from his position as Director" at the company. That might sound obvious, but I'm guessing confirming this is some kind of requirement with regards to corporate structure.</p>

<p>Kato's death will be marked by a funeral and a wake that are open only to close family members "in accordance with the wishes of the bereaved family", Nihon Falcom's statement reads. The studio is also "respectfully" declining condolence gifts or physical messages of sympathy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-chairman-dies-ys-x.jpg?itok=ZQJ-kNcH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-chairman-dies-ys-x.jpg?itok=DtqOkBVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nihon Falcom is known for franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nihon Falcom was founded by Masayuki Kato back in 1981, with the studio <a href="https://shmuplations.com/ys/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">named for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>' Millennium Falcon spaceship</a> (and the N being swapped for an M due to the popularity of the "com" suffix at the time).</p>

<p>The company's early games would prove hugely influential in shaping the then-nascent JRPG and action RPG genres; with franchises like&nbsp;<em>Ys</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Slayer</em>, the company arguably laid the groundwork for later giants like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>.</p>

<p>Today, Nihon Falcom is perhaps best known for the still-ongoing&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>franchises, the latter of which has birthed the popular&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series to which luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel&nbsp;</em>belong.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=9K48phDZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nihon-falcom-trails-of-cold-steel.jpg?itok=MZqYu2jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Trails&nbsp;</em>sub-series is just one of Nihon Falcom's exports.</figcaption></figure><p>While Kato remained the chairman of Nihon Falcom, he wasn't its president; that role is filled by Toshihiro Kondo, who said back in October that the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation" rel="nofollow">considering utilizing generative AI</a> for speedier translations.</p>

<p>It's not clear how the day-to-day running of Nihon Falcom will be affected by Kato's death, but for now, we can simply mourn the loss of one of the JRPG world's most influential figures. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It stands for “Second Valuable Player.” A few games here and there have used it, namely some MOBAs like <em>League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>, but it isn’t the most common gaming phrase. It is fortunately an easy concept to understand, and one worth knowing when it comes to ranked play. Let’s break down what SVP means in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p><h2 id="h167359"><a id="svp"></a>What is SVP?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-recommend-id="image://9486f2106988401fd4cb7b3f41e1d0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Post-Match result screen shows a defeated team with Jeff the Land Shark as the SVP." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The MVP is always the best-performing player on the winning team. <strong>On the flip side is the SVP, or Second Valuable Player, who is the best performer on the losing team.</strong> Even though they lost, they’re highlighted for putting in the most work among their teammates.</p><p>SVP is likely awarded on the same merits that MVP would be. The Ace players for each team are likely the ones that will be awarded MVP and SVP in the end. <strong>Here are some general guidelines to improve your chances of being considered the best on your team</strong>:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Spending time on the match’s objective is key for everyone.</li><li>Blocking damage is an important duty for Vanguards.</li><li>Getting the most kills isn’t always the most important thing in a team game, but it is what Duelists should aim for.</li><li>Healers are vital for every team, so Strategists should heal as much damage as possible.</li></ul><p>The SVP title doesn’t mean much in regular quick matches besides earning some kudos for doing your best. When it comes to Competitive Play, however, it does have a functional purpose that everyone on the losing team will want: Hanging onto more Ranked points.</p><h2 id="h167360"><a id="avoid"></a>How to avoid losing Rank with SVP<br></h2><p>The Rank system in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is pretty simple. When it comes to progress, your Rank will increase with every win and decrease with every loss. There is one small consolation though—<strong>the SVP in a Competitive match loses fewer Ranked points</strong>. </p><p>Although there is no way to prevent the entire team from dropping their Rank, the best player on the losing team can at least receive a more lenient deduction. It’s a great way to motivate you to try your hardest during the most difficult situations. You should be aiming to win no matter what, but it’s still nice to know you might have a saving grace waiting if you do really well despite losing the match.</p><p>SVP isn’t as flashy as MVP, but earning the title is still a great accomplishment in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. You’ll need to take your role seriously and be a real team player to be the best for either team. If you want to know how else to be an asset to your allies, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up Abilities</a></span> can make a difference. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://playdauntless.com/news/reflections-what-comes-next/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>website titled "Reflections on the Launch and What Comes Next", Phoenix Labs says it "hear[s]" players' frustration with Awakening and that it "sincerely apologize[s]" to players who felt their "time, effort, and trust were overlooked".</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs goes on to say that while its goals for Awakening were "ambitious", it acknowledges that the release of the update caused "frustration and confusion" and that it's "committed" to earning players' trust back.</p>

<p>Additionally, all game modes will be unlocked from the jump for returning players in an upcoming update, so you won't have to complete the new questline to unlock your favorite mode.</p>

<p>Phoenix Labs also says it's currently working on "immediate adjustments...to address progression, monetization, and technical issues", which were three of the biggest areas players identified as frustrations with Awakening.</p>

<p>Throughout the rest of the post, Phoenix Labs goes into detail regarding how it plans to reimburse players' time, detailing what initiatives are in place to fix&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and make it appealing to returning players again.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Awakening update, it launched earlier this month, with the Steam version of the game also arriving on the same date.</p>

<p>Handily, that means&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam reviews</a>, which are currently sitting at Overwhelmingly Negative,&nbsp;pretty accurately reflect players' feelings about Awakening. Complaints include new paywalls where none previously existed, as well as massive changes to weapon crafting, technical problems, and much more.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that although&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-boasts-over-four-million-players-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">more than four million players</a> in its opening week, numbers have dwindled massively since then, and the Awakening update hasn't exactly restored trust in Phoenix Labs.</p>

<p>Hopefully, the changes outlined in the developer's blog post can bring players back, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was the beginning of the end for&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>either. You can play the game right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/331370/Dauntless/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dauntless/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dauntless/9nq0v4dwrk49" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dauntless-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> for free.</p>

But, as it turns out, I might have spoken too soon! 2024 provided a huge list of great third- and first-person shooters across console and PC, from devs both big and small. This year had so many awesome games that deciding which shooters to recognize here and which to leave aside was a painful process.</p><p> As before, this list is split into two sections. First, we’ll look at seven fantastic new shooters that arrived this year. Then, we’ll look at a few older shooters that received updates and continued support in 2024.

On the flip side, when I see a Venom try to do that and I’m playing as Black Widow, I just smile and snipe that gooey bastard from afar. Everyone is powerful. Everyone feels dangerous in the right hands. Is this balanced? Probably not.

<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a game that some might not have expected to see happen after the dissolution of Google Stadia and its studios shortly after the launch of its predecessor, Journey to the Savage Planet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, after Typhoon Studios was shut down in 2021, its founders started another studio called Raccoon Logic and acquired the rights to Journey and the planned sequel. Now, over three years later, Revenge of the Savage Planet is on its way to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC in May 2025.</p>



<p>I was recently invited to a preview event for the game to get a more detailed look at the gameplay, a few missions, weapons, enemies, the planets you’ll visit, and more. While I didn’t get to play the game firsthand, I was shown over 30 minutes of gameplay that left me excited with what I saw and wishing I was shown more.</p>



<h2 id="h-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-preview">Revenge of the Savage Planet Preview</h2>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is built in Unreal Engine 5 – specifically, 5.3 – and features a vibrant world with unique creatures and over-the-top animations that could best be described as goofy. There are four main planets with a secret fifth planet that you unlock “if you figure out the mysteries of the world and find it yourself”.</p>



<p>As opposed to the first game in the series, this game moves to a third-person perspective. Creative Director Alex Hutchinson said the developers made the move for a few reasons, including opening up for more character customization, better platforming, and better for seeing things that can happen to players such as catching on fire or slipping. With the move to third-person, the game removed the slap mechanic in favor of keeping the kick that can send creatures launching high into the air. It was done because kicks looked “funnier” in third person than a slap did, Hutchinson said.</p>



<p>As far as what players can expect with gameplay, Hutchinson said that Revenge of the Savage Planet is a “Metroidvania at heart”. You have to get new weapons and equipment, upgrade your skills, and uncover coordinates for the new planets to progress forward. There’s also character customization and home customization that lets you express yourself in the way you see fit.</p>



<p>Each planet has its own unique creatures that vary between friendly and hostile. Some will just roam around you while others will go out of their way to attack. One example on the desert planet is a beetle that digs its horn into the ground to help it flip and try to hit you with its back.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Exploration Is The Name Of The Game</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a map that the team debated adding. Hutchinson said they didn’t want players to play the game through a map. To avoid that, Raccoon Logic made it so the map reveals itself as you go to various areas rather than being available from the get-go. That’s part of the game’s ultimate goal as well. The developers don’t want you to get through the planets in one fell swoop while you play. With the various locations, they said that the goal is to distract you with everything around you. Each planet has a number of secrets to unlock and special areas to explore that will keep you from getting what you need in order to return to Earth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking of exploration, the planets have a layered environment, giving you more areas to visit and traverse. Some have you bouncing through a fungi canopy while others have you gliding through the sky to get to your destination.</p>



<p>The game can be played alone or with a friend either locally or online with cross-play support. Despite talks of potentially allowing for four-player co-op, Racoon Logic said that the decision to limit it to two-player was a creative choice. They found that players are more likely to talk and interact more with one other play than with a group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding game length, Raccoon Logic says tests have shown it taking around 20 hours to 100% the game while some have completed the main story in 15 hours. This is by design as the studio wanted to keep it realistic to complete where it didn’t feel like a chore or burden to get through. To hit that time frame, the game’s difficulty scale isn’t one to push players away. Rather than a traditional scale as you progress, Revenge of the Savage Planet’s difficulty will adjust based on how efficient you are as you play. The more efficient, the more challenging it can be. Still, they didn’t want the game to be too challenging for anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not about challenge, it’s more about exploring,” Hutchinson said while adding that they view the game as something for all ages. “We’re not Dark Souls, we’re ‘Light Souls’.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, I was left excited about what Raccoon Logic has built with Revenge of the Savage Planet. The planets, for the areas shown, look great — there’s an ice planet that wasn’t shown but was talked about that I’m really interested in visiting — and the gameplay appears fun and accessible. One thing I would’ve liked to see more of during my time around the game, though, was its satire and humor. Journey to the Savage Planet was a bit hit or miss in that area. So, I’m hoping the writing is a bit better this time around. That said, humor is subjective so I know what I may find funny or not likely won’t be the same as you or someone else playing the game.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the game will be coming to PC and consoles when it launches. For those on consoles, it’s currently planned to launch at a locked 30 frames per second (FPS). They are looking at getting it to 60 FPS on the systems, but it’s not something in the cards just yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing that the game will feature are platform-specific costumes at launch. For example, those on Xbox will have a Red Ring of Death costume available exclusively to them. Eventually, the plan is to bring every outfit to every player, but, at the start, they want to give players a unique feel depending on what they choose to play on.</p>



<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet launches in May 2025, so stick with Insider Gaming for a full review around release.</p>

<p>Certain meta decks dominated Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s early weeks, but the release of Celebi ex prompted a new meta deck in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, and we have a walkthrough of our best deck, and how to get it.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-set-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a> expansion brought about a new, complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-card-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set of cards</a>. Alongside fiery new ex pulls and stunning Full Arts, one card arguably stands out above the rest—Celebi ex. Mew may be the cover star of Mythical Island, but Celebi ex has a certain quality, making it a necessity for the best grass decks.</p>



<p>I present to you our best Celebi ex meta deck, how to get the card, and how to get the most out of it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-celebi-ex-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How to Get Celebi ex in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The heart of this deck. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Celebi ex can either be pulled from Mythical Island booster packs in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket, or crafted using Pack Points.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not a Premium Pass promo card like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-promo-10-mewtwo-card-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewtwo 10 card</a>, and there is no special challenge to get a Celebi ex. You need to get lucky with a Mythical Island booster pack and score one of the multiple ex designs, or save up 500 Pack Points—<strong>for Mythical Island, not Genetic Apex</strong>—and purchase it.</p>







<p>The best Celebi ex meta deck requires <strong>two each of Celebi ex</strong>, <strong>Snivy</strong>, <strong>Servine</strong>, <strong>Serperior</strong>, one <strong>Dhelmise</strong>, and one copy of <strong>Mystical Island’s</strong> <strong>Exeggcute</strong> and <strong>Exggecutor</strong>.</p>



<p>Grass decks are boss, but to get the top cards, they’re normally Two-Stage Evolutions—which isn’t ideal in a very RNG-orientated card game. So, for my best Celebi ex deck, I want a good mix of Basics and later evolutions.</p>



<p>Here’s my best Celebi ex Meta Deck I recommend using.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-celebi-ex-type-alternatives-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Best Celebi ex type alternatives in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>The main alternative to Celebi ex has to be <strong>Venusaur ex</strong>—another hard-to-get card if luck isn’t on your side.</p>



<p>You can charge up a Venusaur ex fast using the deck’s Serperior emphasis. Players might prefer this as Venusaur trumps Celebi ex’s HP with a whopping <strong>190 HP</strong>. This makes the card extra tanky, and while its Giant Bloom attack <em>only </em>(in the context of a Stage 2 ex) does 100 damage, <strong>it recovers 30 HP with every attack</strong>—prolonging its life. </p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-celebi-ex-deck-so-powerful-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Why is Celebi ex Deck so Powerful in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>The star of the show is Celebi ex. The reason? <strong>Serperior’s Jungle Totem ability</strong> makes it so “Each Grass energy attached to your Pokémon&nbsp;provides 2 Grass Energy. This effect doesn’t stack.” This effectively makes it the <strong>grass equivalent of Garvedoir</strong>, only, you can’t have two Serperiors at once both using Jungle Totem—just the one.</p>



<p>Now, you can stack energy on Celebi ex, making its Powerful Bloom move deadly. Here’s a description of the attack, “<strong>Flip a coin for each Energy attached to this Pokémon. This attack does 50 damage for each heads.</strong>“</p>



<p>You need to focus on building up a Celebi ex, all the while trying to speed through Snivy’s evolution line until it becomes Serperior. Having two lots of each highlighted Pokémon gives us better chances of pulling them faster. To fill out the deck, Dhelmise has great HP for a Basic, and if you don’t have Celebi ex yet, its main attack can also be charged up to great effect.</p>



<p>Finally, I prefer the Mystical Island Exeggcute and Exggecutor for a couple of reasons. While I love Exeggcutor’s EX card from Genetic Apex, it was very luck-dependent, and <strong>its ex status risks a two-point loss</strong>. The Mythical Island Exeggutor has 130 HP as a non-ex (we love this) and its main attack is another that can be charged through Serperior.</p>

<p>No doubt Rebirth will befall a similar fate - I look forward to seeing the Weapons replaced by Thomas the Tank Engine.</p>
<p>Hamaguchi's comments <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">echo those of Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida</a>, who similarly asked fans not to create inappropriate mods for that game's PC release. That may have been asking for trouble, but since its release in September the weirdest mods were simply <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-modders-put-ben-starrs-shining-meme-face-on-clives-cape">adding Ben Starr's shining meme face to Clive's cape</a>.</p><p>Hamaguchi also told Epic that DLC was considered for the PC version "as an episodic story", much like the Yuffie INTERmission DLC for Remake. However, with limited resources, the team ultimately decided finishing the third game in the trilogy was the "highest priority".</p>
<p>"However, if we receive strong requests from players after the release regarding certain matters, we would like to consider them," added Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth will come with improved lighting, though, and fans have been sharing comparisons on social media.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 has yet to be released, but a talented fan has already managed to quite convincingly reimagine a small portion of the game in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Over the past weekend, an alleged leaked video of the new entry in the series started making the rounds, fooling the vast majority of fans with its great attention to detail. The short video, however, isn't a real leaked video of Grand Theft Auto 6, but an Unreal Engine 5 creation made to look as close as possible to the real leaked videos of the game, which surfaced online a while back, made by a developer known as Long Long Time in around one month. While it may have been disappointing to learn that the video wasn't the first look at the game in a very long time, it is still an interesting watch that showcases the developer's amazing talent at creating a very believable slice of a game we have seen very little of so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Confirmed fake. <a href="https://t.co/Hz8MNeSDTh">pic.twitter.com/Hz8MNeSDTh</a></p>
<p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1868021749687931287?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>No matter when it will launch, Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to have a huge impact on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-publishers/">video game industry</a> as a whole, so much so that some publishers are planning the release of their own titles so as not to coincide with its launch. Analysts also predict it will be the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/"> biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, and its failure could have some important consequences for the industry. Not that a failure is likely, judging from fake leaks like the one above, as the hype for the next entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only getting bigger the more we inch closer to its late 2025 launch.</p>

Developer Creatures Inc. has still added myriad new missions and solo battles for players to interact with though, which somewhat recreates that opening day feeling of the digital trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of special cards added with Mythical Island too, which despite adding 86 cards total officially caps out at 68 cards. This means there are 18 of the "secrete" alternate art cards, including one immersive and one crown card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the mission front, Mythical Island Dex Missions have been added which, just like Genetic Apex, reward players with special shop tickets for collecting five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 50, and 60 unique Mythical Island cards. These can be used to redeem a Mew icon.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deck Missions are added too, rewarding players with Rental Decks for collecting some of the major new cards available in Mythical Island including Celebi ex, Gyarados ex, Mew ex, Aerodactyl ex, and Pidgeot ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Themed Collections are also updated for Mythical Island. A variety of missions here reward different items for collecting, well, themed collections of cards, such as the Flower Travelers mission tasking players with collecting the three flower Pokémon in the Florges evolution line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solo Battles at the Step-Up and Expert tiers have also been updated with new challenges. Eight new Step-Up Battles have been added for Mythical Island decks, with players able to take on the second most challenging versions of decks such as Celebi ex and Mew ex to earn rewards such as pack hourglasses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another eight decks are added at the Expert Battle tier, which each reward seven Pack Hourglasses upon completion. The Step-Up Battles offer five, so a total of 96 Pack Hourglasses are available in solo battles alone, letting players open eight booster packs at no cost. This comes on top of 12 Pack Hourglasses that Creatures Inc. offered as free gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Wonder Picks, these now appear to only serve Mythical Island packs and no longer Genetic Apex, though it's possible the new set is just dominating the random selection since the majority of players are presumably opening it on launch day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Other changes to the game will emerge over the coming days, as the 86 new cards are slotted into the meta and shake up the player versus player scene. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">A new Vaporeon card is already threatening to make Misty even more powerful</a>, while Aerodactyl ex may lead Pokémon TCG Pocket's first control deck by stopping players evolving their Active Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>Earlier this month, CD Projekt Red finally shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">a new teaser featuring Ciri</a> as a fully fledged Witcher on her own adventure. And while there wasn't much time for fun and frivolity in that preview, the developers are hinting that the card game Gwent will be featured in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba and executive producer Gosia Mitręga were asked about Gwent's presence in The Witcher 4 during their joint interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmbhFPninuw&amp;t=635s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Allies</a>. While neither Kalemba nor Mitrega came right out and said Gwent is in the game, they certainly seemed to confirm it.</p><p>"We really love [Gwent], and we also really carefully, always listen to the community⁠--which we love--and it's an amazing one. But I don't think anyone will be disappointed," said Mitrega. "It's a part of the experience, absolutely," agreed Kalema. "We also love Gwent."</p><p>Gwent was featured extensively in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, and its popularity among players led CD Projekt Red to release a standalone title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/gwent-review-heart-of-the-cards/1900-6417024/" data-ref-id="1900-6417024">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a>. Near the beginning of December, Hachette Boardgames UK and No Loading Games announced plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">release Gwent as a physical tabletop game</a> with a deck of 400 cards and a playmat. It's expected to be released in late 2025.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and CD Projekt Red only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">ramped up its team to over 400 developers</a> and officially began production. Kalemba also shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a scene-by-scene breakdown of the teaser trailer</a>, which sheds more light on Ciri's actions and dropped hints about a potentially different outcome than the one fans witnessed in the preview. </p>

Ciri had a big role role the third game, and as seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser for The Witcher 4</a>, she's going to be the main character in the next title. However, sharp-eared players may have already picked up on the fact that CD Projekt Red has recast Ciri for her upcoming starring role.</p><p>CD Projekt Red confirmed <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-witcher-4-ciri-voice-actor-jo-wyatt-recast-rumours/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>'s report that Irish actress Ciara Berkeley voiced Ciri in the teaser trailer, and she will portray the heroine in The Witcher 4 as well. Jo Wyatt previously voiced Ciri in The Witcher 3 and its DLC. Berkeley only has a handful of credits to her name, including the TV miniseries Swing Bout, The Deceived, and Normal People. A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told The Gamer that "Ciara is a talented actress who impressed us with her enthusiasm and vocal acting skills, and in this trailer we believe she truly brought Ciri to life in a way that is both faithful to the character and exciting for fans of the series."</p><p>There may potentially be other parts that are recast in the game, but Doug Cockle will be back as Ciri's mentor Geralt. Earlier this summer, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">confirmed that Geralt will be a part of the next game</a>, although he later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">walked back his comments</a> shortly before the teaser reveal at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6077/" data-ref-id="2900-6077">The Game Awards</a>. Geralt's voice was heard at the end of the teaser that streamed during the ceremony, but not in the standalone trailer on YouTube.</p><p>The Witcher 4 game director Sebastian Kalemba recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/" data-ref-id="1100-6528474">a breakdown of the first teaser</a>, which included details about the monster that Ciri was hunting as well as the young woman that she was trying to save. The scenes that played out in the trailer will be a part of The Witcher 4's narrative, and Kalemba hinted that players may be able to change the outcome in Ciri's favor.</p><p>CD Projekt Red hasn't announced a release date for The Witcher 4 yet.</p>
