        <p>Plug being pulled in May.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Just weeks after laying off the "majority" of its staff, developer Phoenix Labs has announced it's shutting down its free-to-play Monster Hunter-style action game, Dauntless.
</p>
<p>
Dauntless' fast-paced take on the Monster Hunter formula received a warm reception when it launched into PC early access in May 2018, but it struggled to maintain that early momentum following a wider launch a year on. And its journey is now officially near its end.
</p>
<p>
Announcing Dauntless' closure in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayDauntless/status/1894090939267702888">terse message on social media</a>, Phoenix Labs wrote, "Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025. Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. Dauntless will no longer be available to play on and after May 29th, 2025 at 11.45pm PST. Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey."

<p>
Confirmation of Dauntless' demise follows several rounds of layoffs at Phoenix Labs, which was acquired by crypto company Forte in 2023. Last May, the studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fae-farm-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-staff-and-cancels-projects-in-significant-restructure">cancelling all projects other than Dauntless and Fae Farm</a> and laying off staff - a move believed to have impacted 140 employees - in order to "pave a path for a strong future". Then came the news last month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dauntless-and-fae-farm-studio-phoenix-labs-lays-off-majority-of-employees">a "majority" of employees would lose their jobs</a> in another round of cuts - which the studio blamed on "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations".
</p>
<p>
At the time, it said it would discuss the future of Dauntless and Fae Farm "in the coming weeks". And while Dauntless' fate is now sealed, Phoenix Labs hasn't yet shared its plans for Fae Farm.

He has covered tech and gaming for all of his 15-plus-year career for publications like Forbes, Business Insider, and more.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ongoing scarcity has made it challenging to purchase Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo since its soft launch last year, but it appears those days are behind us. The $99.99 alarm clock is now readily available from third-party retailers in the US, starting with <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/z73qyjwthc940">Best Buy</a>. You can also buy it directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> without a subscription, with the only caveat being that you must sign in with a Nintendo account.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->100</span></p><div><p>The Alarmo takes dozens of characters and scenes from classic Nintendo franchises and places them in a charming alarm clock that’s designed to help you sleep and wake. It uses motion sensors to detect whether you’re still in bed and gets more aggressive the longer you sleep in.</p></div></div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">announced its alarm clock in October</a> while we patiently awaited (any) news regarding the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which is set to launch later this year. Although the Alarmo is certainly not as exciting as a new console, it is unapologetically Nintendo, with a cartoonish look that calls to mind a vintage alarm clock — albeit with a few modern features.</p><p>Nintendo’s bright red alarm clock features an illuminated button on top and a rounded face that houses an LCD display. The 2.8-inch panel shows the time/date and will attempt to wake you each morning with scenes and sounds from several iconic franchises. It makes room for visits from beloved characters like Link and Mario, as well as pikmin. There are currently 35 scenes across five franchises available, and Nintendo says you’ll be able to download more in the future. An integrated motion sensor can detect whether you’ve moved, too, and each scene will get progressively more aggressive based on whether you’re knocked out cold or making an effort to get out of bed (it goes silent once you’re up).</p><p>Button mode enables a more traditional alarm clock experience by allowing you to start and stop alarms or access the settings by tapping and twisting the button on top. The Alarmo can also automatically initiate sleep sounds once you’ve jumped into bed for the night, provide basic insights into your sleeping habits, and even sound hourly chimes to help you keep track of time throughout the day. Individually, these features don’t always work as well as those on a dedicated alarm clock or sound machine, but most of those aren’t nearly as cute.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2D “Metroidbrainia” was first revealed back in 2024 and it continues to look very neat. You have to uncover secrets and manage the clock to liberate yourself from a glitched time loop.

            <p>
It's been a bit of a showcase-y start to the week - first with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">Annapurna Interactive doing its thing</a> and now with another instalment of Microsoft's occassional indie-focused ID@Xbox showcase. This time around, we got a couple of new announcements, a whole bunch of release dates, a tanuki postie, a fresh helping of Tron, another look at that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> DLC, and more. And if you missed any of the announcements, you can read on to learn more.

If it's lightly satirical sci-fi action you're after - and it absolutely must contain goo - then you might be interested in Revenge of the Savage Planet. This third-person follow up to 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/journey-to-the-savage-planet">Journey To The Savage Planet</a> features new planets, online co-op, cross-play, and more - and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC on 8th May.

<p>
Keepsake Games' Jump Ship is a co-op FPS where up to four players attempt to leap across the universe by selecting from a variety of hand-crafted missions. As the action plays out, they can seamlessly transition from operating their ship to on-foot planetary exploration, even space walks if need be. There's also talk of scavenging to make upgrades and repairs, as well as random elements to keep things fresh. Jump Ship comes to early access this summer.

<p>
Echo Weaver is a "time loop metroidBRAINia where time is [the] best resource and secrets are [the] only upgrades." It sees players navigating the remnants of a ruined society - a task made more challenging by the fact they're stuck in a glitching time loop. To escape, they'll need to rely on the energy of the loop itself, using it to heal, trade, and more. Developer Moonlight Kids also proudly proclaims, "No upgrades, no unlocks, just secrets... you can already do everything, you just don't know how yet." Echo Weaver doesn't have a release date, but it's coming to Xbox and PC with a day one release on Game Pass.

<p>
Fans of rogue-lite dungeon-crawling and shop management can witness their loves smash together again later this year when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> 2: The Endless Vault launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass. On a basic level, developer Digital Sun's sequel promises more of the same, but it does have a few new tricks - including a new setting and a leap from the original's charming pixel art to striking 3D.

<p>
There's a lot of buzz already for developer Dogubomb's "atmospheric architectural adventure", Blue Prince - a deeply intriguing puzzler set in an ever-changing house. The ultimate goal is to find the elusive Room 46 by unravelling the secrets on its 9x5 grid of chambers, but players can only venture so many steps before it reconfigures itself again. Blue Prince looks like fiendishly clever stuff and it now has a release date, coming to PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Game Pass on 10th April.

<p>
If, like me, you've been itching to get back into an orange camper van ever since your family's beloved Volkswagen dramatically burst into flames in the middle of the road somewhere in the 90s, developer Square Glade Games' Outbound should be pure bliss. It's a game of open-world wilderness roving and survival, where you'll need to grow your own crops, harness natural resources for energy, customise your vehicle, and build a comically impractical house on your roof. Sadly, it's not out until next year, but I'm ready and eager.

<h3>Herdling</h3>

<p>
Herdlings, the latest from Far: Lone Sails developer Okomotive, is a "stirring and beautiful journey into the mountains... and beyond" that sees players shepherding (or herding, I guess) mysterious creatures across a strikingly picturesque landscape of sweeping peaks, fog-shrouded forests, and more. You'll need to hone your skills to overcome its challenges, threats, and a smattering of light puzzles - and you'll probably need a few tissues too given it's promising an "emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing through a fallen world". Herdlings is out this summer on PC and consoles.

<p>
Wax Heads, from developer Patattie Games, continues to look a treat. It's a "cosy-punk" narrative game about running a struggling record store, where players are tasked with satisfying eccentric customers by rooting out the perfect musical purchase. It's got puzzles, arcade cabinets, stickers, and "punchy, humorous" dialogue - and it's coming to Xbox Series X/S and PC in "summer" next year.

<p>
The Lonesome Guild is a single-player action-RPG "full of heart, battles, and bonds that change everything". It's the work of developer Tiny Bull Studios and follows protagonist Ghost (a ghost) and their ragtag team of friends as they try to save the world. It promises puzzles, intense battles, and a land full of mystery and treasure that players can explore by seamlessly switching between party members - with new side quests and abilities unlocking as bonds are strengthened among the team. It's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC this autumn.

<h3>Buckshot Roulette</h3>

<p>
Pretty much everything you need to know about Buckshot Roulette is right there in the title. Developer Mike Klubnika's grimly comedic twist on Russian Roulette - the twist being that it involves a shotgun - is a game of bargaining, begging, and betrayal, as players battle to walk away rich over the course of a 15-minute match. It was a bit of a viral sensation when it launches in 2023, and it's coming to Xbox and Game Pass "soon".

Suda51 and Swery's 2.5D slasher parody Hotel Barcelona <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year">didn't quite make its originally planned 2024 release date</a>, but today's ID@Xbox showing indicates it's still on track to launch this year. Its weird, wild premise sees novice federal marshal protagonist Justine - who's got an insane serial killer named Dr. Carnival living inside her - breaking up a serial killer shindig in the titular Pittsburgh hotel. That involves rampaging across seven levels, each inspired by a different horror movie and featuring a distinct boss. She's also got a bit of extra help from the ghosts of her previous attempts, which manifest to fight alongside her.

Developer LocalThunk's poker-inspired roguelite Balatro has been a smashing success since releasing last year. But if you haven't had chance to play it yet, you've <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-balatro-has-shadow-dropped-on-game-pass">now got the option to do so via Game Pass</a>. And to accompany its arrival on Microsoft's subscription service, a free new DLC - adding cosmetic card backs inspired by the likes of Assassin's Creed, Fallout, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> - launches today on all platforms.

<p>
The last band management game I can remember playing was Rockstar Ate My Hamster, and that came out over 35 years ago. Yet Rockbeasts from developer Lichthund somehow reminded me of that game's anarchic spirit, even if you're playing grumpy, grungy animals instead of parodies of real-life musos here. "Lead a band of misfits on a roller-coaster ride to stardom in the age of MTV, rock anthems, and bad haircuts," explains its official blurb, before dropping the bombshell that it also stars Iggy Pop. Rockbeasts, officially a "story-driven, role-playing management game" is coming to Steam and consoles later this year.

<p>
Ratatan, if you're unfamiliar, is the spiritual successor to Sony Japan Studio's beloved PlayStation Portable rhythm adventure Patapon. It managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patapon-creators-ratatan-kickstarter-funded-within-an-hour">smash its crowdfunding goal within an hour of launch</a> back in 2023 and development's been quietly ticking along since then. Helmed by Patapon creator Hiroyuki Kotani, with original Patapon musician Kemmei Adach also onboard, it promises a roguelike blend of rhythm and side-scroller action in which players build an army of 100 Cobun to take on foes. Ratatan was originally targeting an Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC release this April, but its latest trailer - shared during ID@Xbox - now only says "2025".

When last we heard from developer Witch Beam, it was gracing us with Unpacking - a lovely little thing that would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is">go on to be crowned Eurogamer's game of 2021</a>. Four years later and it's poised to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tempopo">Tempopo</a>, a vibrant musical puzzler set across a world of floating islands. Each island is a puzzle and finding the solution enables protagonist Hana to reclaim a lost musical bloom and replant it in her garden. Finding the solution, however, involves using Hana's conducting skills to guide the titular Tempopo onward, encouraging them to smash, block, lift, and push their way to victory. It's coming to PC, consoles, and Game Pass on 17th April.

<p>
Tiny Monks Tales' Woodo is absolutely adorable, and I'm already sold based on that fact alone. But more specifically, it's a "cosy 3D puzzle matching game" in which players work through a series of dioramas charting a new episode in the life of Foxy and Ben the frog. Each new stage brings a new selection of items - lovely, chunky wood-carved things - and players have to figure out where they belong, dropping them into a scene with a satisfying plop. There's no release date for Woodo yet, but it's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation, and PC.

<p>
In Denkiworks' Tanuki: Pon's Summer, the Tanuki Festival is just a month away. Unfortunately, the shrine is also in need of repair - and so enters Pon, a well meaning Tanuki who gets himself a part-time job delivering packages, all in the name of raising some coin. There's a colourful cast of characters to befriend, a whole bunch of side activities and sports to pursue - from baseball and sushi-making to enthusiastic drumming - and best of all, you get a BMX you'll be using to hurtle around the game's four towns, inspired by Kyoto, Aomori, Sapporo, and Beppu. It's a delightful looking thing and it's out on PC, Switch, Xbox, and Game Pass later this year.

<p>
Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to developer RageSquid's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has a release date and is coming to Xbox, PC, and Game Pass on 9th April. It's an intriguing one too, ditching the exhilarating mountain biking of its predecessor in favour of basically as many extreme sports as possible. That's obviously a pretty ambitious goal, so Descenders Next is starting smaller and focusing on boarding sports - the snow kind and otherwise - across "multiple huge biomes". It's got extensive customisation, a Monstercat soundtrack, and support for up to 12 players.

After getting its neon on in 2023's Tron: Idenity, Bithell Games is back with more future action in Tron: Catalyst. It's an "all-new story-driven, isometric action adventure game" in which players ride Light Cycles and engage in Identity Disc combat as they traverse the crumbling Arq Grid. There's talk of "intriguing stories within a budding revolution", as well as secret areas and shortcuts to find - all of which players will be able to experience when Tron: Catalyst comes to  PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on 17th June.

After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spiritfarer-studios-33-player-co-op-roguelike-33-immortals-has-been-delayed-into-next-year">bit of a delay</a> nudged Spiritfarer studio Thunder Lotus' 33 Immortals into this year, it's finally launching into PC and Xbox Series X/S early access on 18th March. It's an intriguing thing too, serving up a striking action roguelike in which players, in the role of damned souls, must co-operative to defeat hordes of monsters and massive bosses in order to rebel against God's final judgment and fight for their eternal lives. There's a twist, however; as its name implies, this is a chaotic quest designed to be tackled by 33 players.

<p>
And finally, a bit of a treat for twinky puppet fans. Lies of P: Overture, the eagerly awaited expansion for 2023's well-received Souls-like adventure, just got an atmospheric new story trailer. Overture, a "dramatic prequel" to the base game, transports players to the city of Krat to witness its final days before the Puppet Frenzy massacre. They'll meet a legendary Stalker and journey through Krat together, uncovering untold stories and hidden secrets. And probably a bunch of extremely tough battles too. There's still no release date for Lies of P: Overture, however, so you'll just have to make do with its latest trailer for now.

  <div>
      <div><p>A new <em>Catan</em> Kickstarter campaign has gone live. Fanroll LLC's new <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> campaign isn't for a revised board game edition but for a series of artisanal, bespoke game components in the vein of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-3d-expansion-and-dawn-of-humankind-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan 3D</em></a>. The campaign was fully funded in an hour.</p>

<h2>The Catan Masterpiece Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the Kickstarter page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ultimatecatan/catan-masterpiece-series/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan Masterpiece</em></a> campaign started as a premium dice set. This escalated to the studio wanting to reimagine every element of the beloved board game. Those reimagined elements include game pieces made of wood, metal, resin, and cut gemstones.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=bgJO1-GM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/catan-masterpiece-ancient-civilization-pieces.jpg?itok=cQUfq52_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That is what you are backing with this Kickstarter. Not a premium version of the <em>Catan</em> board game, but individual components made with pristine materials. Backers have tons of options from resin or painted wooden dice to metallic or resin Robber pieces to gemstone hex tiles. There are even three sets of player pieces: Metal Classic, Plastic Civilizations, and Metal Civilizations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The CATAN Masterpiece Series is a tribute to the game that has brought joy and camaraderie to so many. It's a celebration of the countless memories made around the table, the friendships forged through friendly competition, and the sheer excitement of watching your settlements and cities come to life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the Catan Masterpiece series are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Explorer for $25: Your choice of two plastic Ancient Civilization pieces and one of eight plastic pins</li>
	<li>Harbormaster for $69: Everything in the Explorer tier, a full set of nine Ports, a wooden dice set, and your choice of resin Robber and two of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Traditionalist for $99: Everything in the Harbormaster tier, a set of Classic Metal player pieces, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, your choice of Metal Robber, and three of eight pins</li>
	<li>Architect for $149: Your choice of four plastic Ancient Civilizations, one Metal Ancient Civilization, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Sharp-edge Dice, a Gemstone Robber, and four of eight pins</li>
	<li>Woodcutter for $299: A set of wood hexes, wood sea frames, Acryllic number discs, everything in Architect tier, and five of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Artisan for $499. A set of Sparkle Resin hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and six of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Stonecutter for $749: A set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, everything in the Architect tier, and seven of eight pins.</li>
	<li>Noble for $999: a set of gemstone hexes, Sparkle Resin sea frames, metal number discs, all Ancient Civilizations, a set of Metal Classic Player Pieces, a set of Nine Ports, a set of Painted Wood and Sharp-edge dice, a Resin Robber, a Metal Robber, a Resin Robber, and all eight pins.</li>
</ul><p>For those wanting a more specialized bundle, the individual pieces can be purchased as separate add-ons once you have backed the project.</p>

<p>At time of writing the <em>Catan Masterpiece</em> Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$286,318, more than five times its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign concludes on March 21.</p>

After a messy run with Zack Snyder, the new plan was to reboot the DC film franchise, connect the shows and movies to it, and give creators more freedom to make varied projects in different genres. And the two said that the goal is to create a universe that feels interconnected, but with films that still feel separate and standalone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As covered by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> who attended the recent DC Studios press event, Gunn doesn’t want people to feel like they need to do homework and watch a bunch of past content before they see the next big DC show or film. </p><p> “We remain steadfast that each of these projects work as a standalone project,” said Gunn. “So you can see <em>Superman</em>, you can watch <em>Lanterns</em>, without having to see both of them. Although if you can, there will be special things in there for people who have seen both.” </p><p> And this is all part of a larger six-year plan, which the duo confirmed will culminate in an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>-like crossover movie. Neither exec had any more details to share about this big movie, which is not likely to hit theaters until 2030, but Gunn has experience producing these kinds of superhero event films, having served as an executive producer on Marvel and Disney’s <em>Endgame </em>in 2019. </p><p>To reach the point where such a project is viable in the new DC universe, Gunn and Safran laid out a plan that calls for a lot of content. According to the DC Studio bosses, the company will produce two-live action movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows every year, some of which will be created exclusively for WB Discovery’s Max. </p><p>It’s an ambitious plan and I worry that it might be too much, too fast, but Gunn and Safran are committed to making sure every movie has a solid script before production begins. Likewise, they admitted they are flexible and will change the plan as needed. </p><p>For example, in 2023, they had no intentions of making a movie about Batman villain Clayface. But then Mike Flanagan, the filmmaker behind works such as <em>Doctor Sleep </em>and <em>Midnight Mass</em>, pitched them one and wrote a script they both loved and it got greenlit. Of course, I’ve not seen <em>Clayface</em>, but it at least sounds like Gunn isn’t too worried about changing plans or fiddling with canon if it means getting a cool movie. That might be the key to defeating superhero fatigue and competing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913">Marvel’s massive MCU</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the nearly 23 years since its release, Neverwinter Nights has remained popular with players who have supported the title with fan-made mods. Now, there's a new expansion for Neverwinter Nights called Doom of Icewind Dale, and it's officially authorized by Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>Doom of Icewind Dale was developed by Luke Scull, a game developer who got his start as a modder for Neverwinter Nights before joining Ossian Studios and working on the official expansion for Neverwinter Nights 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neverwinter-nights-2-mysteries-of-westgate-review/1900-6209264/" data-ref-id="1900-6209264">Mysteries of Westgate</a>. Scull also established himself as a fantasy author outside of the gaming realm, and he's crafted Doom of Icewind Dale as the first installment of a new multi-part storyline called The Blades of Netheril.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449255" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449255"></a><figcaption>A screencap from Doom of Icewind Dale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449255-doomoficewinddale1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449257,1300-4449258,1300-4449259,1300-4449260,1300-4449261" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449257-doomoficewinddale2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449258-doomoficewinddale3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449259-doomoficewinddale4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449260-doomoficewinddale5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4449261-doomoficewinddale6.jpg"></figure><p>The story for Doom of Icewind Dale begins around two decades after Neverwinter Nights' campaign with the player's character left for dead and their memories stripped away. From there, players have to reclaim their identity, figure out why they were abducted, and "uncover a sinister plot to unleash a rage-filled godling upon the North."</p><p>The base game is required to play the expansion, but Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition is currently on sale on Fanatical. As for Doom of Icewind Dale itself, players can pick it up for $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3093340/Neverwinter_Nights_Enhanced_Edition_Doom_of_Icewind_Dale/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It has approximately 10-15 hours of gameplay that lets players explore some of the 10 towns of Icewind Dale, as well as other locations including Icewind Pass, the Dwarven Valley, and the Reghed Glacier. It also includes new monsters and original music created for the expansion.</p><p>Like several of D&amp;D's adaptations, Neverwinter Nights and Doom of Icewind Dale are set in The Forgotten Realms. That setting is also going to be used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-developing-a-live-action-dungeons-dragons-series-set-in-the-forgotten-realms-report/1100-6529513/" data-ref-id="1100-6529513">the Dungeons &amp; Dragons live-action series</a> that is currently in development.</p><p><em>GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t release until March 20, but that hasn’t stopped some players from getting their hands on a copy of the game. Ubisoft knows about the situation and has, in turn, released a statement to players about Assassin’s Creed Shadows getting out to the public early and the leaks that have followed.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1894135156312617339/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledges that players have</a> “accessed Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of its official release”. Ubisoft says that players, if they see the gameplay, should know that there is still some work being done to prepare for the day one experience.</p>



<p>“The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game,” Ubisoft said.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dauntless-being-shutdown-by-phoenix-labs-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dauntless Being Shutdown By Phoenix Labs In May</a></h6>



<p>The studio also called the leaks “unfortunate” and “can diminish the excitement for players”. To that point, they suggest those with the game avoid publishing anything to avoid spoiling it for those who are waiting until the game launches.</p>



<p>“We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others,” they said. “Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.</p>



<p>“Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!”</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game’s launch comes after multiple delays from its original fall 2024 release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that DC Studios</a> is in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm for any upcoming DC video games. This was mentioned during a visit that brought the press out for a studio update on their upcoming films, shows, and games. Typically, games aren't included in these sorts of meetings, but after James Gunn was announced as co-head of DC Studios, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-boss-reveals-plans-to-expand-arkham-universe-beyond-suicide-squad/">announced a plan</a> to include games in an interconnected DC universe.</p>
<p>During this meeting, James Gunn confirmed that the heads of DC Studios have been meeting with WB Games Division Head JB Perrette, where they then meet with members of NetherRealm and Rocksteady.</p>
<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "it's really the first time its ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Gunn says that there are designs for the projects "in their very earliest stages," when he then goes on to talk about what the story could be for the character or the game's overall theme. However, when asked about when people will begin to see hints of video games coming in the DCU, James Gunn said that it will be a "couple years" from now.</p>
<p>There's also been no hints as to what kind of games will be in development. It's well-known and well-documented as to what fans would like. Fans have been waiting for Injustice 3 for nearly a decade. However, fans instead received Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. These are two games that did not perform well at all, with the support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League ending last month.</p>
<p>As a result of this, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/">Warner Bros. Games CEO left</a> the company thanks to the major failure of the Suicide Squad game and MultiVersus. It's always been known that Marvel is more popular than DC in nearly every avenue, but especially when it comes to DC games. They are known for being hit or miss. However, with new Batman games reportedly in development, there is hope that these games will be as successful as the other Batman games that were released.</p>

Three years later, the game has been brought over the finish line by the rest of the team at Indonesian studio Pikselnesia, with a result that feels unavoidably prescient. Though <em>Afterlove EP </em>isn’t without its flaws, its meditation on the mundane ways grief distorts us, and the unglamorous journey of finding our way back to the light, offers an understated catharsis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>follows Rama, an indie band frontman who loses a part of himself when his partner Cinta unexpectedly passes away. He spends a year in self-inflicted isolation, and by the time he’s ready to crawl out of his apartment and try to be a person again, he’s surprised to see how much of the world has moved on without him. Or, at least, tried to. His bandmates have felt trapped in his indecision, so they’ve been looking for lifeboats off a sinking ship with new projects and career paths. Rama expected everything to be where he left it a year ago. <em>Afterlove EP </em>spends much of its time underlining that while grief deserves sympathy, it doesn’t become a free pass to treat people however you want.</p><p>Grief requires some grace. No one handles the loss of a loved one “perfectly,” and a story that criticizes someone going through that pain can be a tough sell, and easy to fuck up if its characters come off as irredeemable or its approach feels insensitive. <em>Afterlove EP </em>starts out with Rama hearing the disembodied voice of Cinta encouraging him to get back out there and perform again, but as the game goes on, it becomes clear it’s less an echo of a lost loved one and more a manifestation of Rama’s inner monologue. Cinta is defensive and accusatory, and puts Rama’s feelings above everyone else’s. As I lived out Rama’s life, I gradually became frustrated when Cinta would weigh in. This wasn’t the compassionate person her grieving friends described, it was someone who almost always defaulted to Rama’s point of view, siding with him even when his friends had grievances that were more than reasonable.</p><figure id="" data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If that disconnect between player and protagonist sounds frustrating, it is, but it makes Rama’s growth and the story’s pay-off so much sweeter.

He’s grieving the loss of someone who was clearly close to him, but the longer I played <em>Afterlove EP</em>, the more it became clear he was myopically obsessed with his own pain and ignoring how others were affected by his absence. The identification I felt with him gradually gave way to alienation as I stood by and watched his relationships unravel, like I was a friend powerless to stop someone I care about from falling further down into despair. <em>Afterlove EP </em>gave me plenty of opportunities to argue with my friends who felt abandoned by me, but for most of the game, I couldn’t find dialogue options that resembled an apology for my absence, my belligerent musician’s ego, or the selfish way I talked about my grief as if it was more important than anyone else’s. I spent hours of <em>Afterlove EP </em>watching people who cared about each other nearly lose one another because Rama couldn’t see past his own pain. Every time I met up with bandmates trying to pick up where things left off, it felt like the ties between them were one wrong word away from snapping as he insisted on his own vision of the music and the band’s future, and was indifferent to his friends’ pain after they lost a friend, too. Rama can be a frustrating character to pilot in a dialogue-based game, and Cinta’s inability to challenge him made me skeptical of her from the beginning, but <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s commitment to its damaged hero and his dysfunctional friend group is a crucial piece of the story it’s telling.</p><p>There’s a fine line between a sympathetic protagonist and a selfish one, and <em>Afterlove EP</em> balances on it so well that by the time I was hours into Rama’s story—watching him be so fixated on his own shit that he was hurting those closest to him—I only felt sorry for him. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees, even in the face of so many possibilities for forming new connections and repairing old ones.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>plays like a <em>Persona </em>game in which you manage relationships and work each day, deciding whether to spend your limited time seeing friends, busking for money, going to therapy to unpack all the discord within your social circles, or possibly building a relationship with a new suitor. I spent most days hanging out with Satria, a record store shopkeeper who knew exactly how to push Rama’s buttons. He’s part of a queer community that plays music in the local park. Rama hasn’t explored this side of himself, and that kind of self-discovery isn’t made easier by having the disembodied voice of your ex talking to you while you try to form new connections. However, <em>Afterlove EP </em>doesn’t reach for the low-hanging fruit I expected it to when it comes to Rama finding new love. Given Cinta’s hold on him, I feared that Rama moving on to a new partner might see the game create a toxic love triangle in his mind, but instead, things play out quite differently. It was a welcome change after Rama’s mourning had gotten in the way of him moving forward for most of the game. Grief is the foundation <em>Afterlove EP </em>is built on, but its waxings on the topic aren’t the only thing it has to say.</p><p>The thread connecting all these relationships is the indie rock music Rama plays. When you’re not chatting with friends and potential lovers, <em>Afterlove EP </em>is a rhythm game with some really catchy tracks that capture the spirit and gusto of young performers who want a life for themselves outside of the bars and kitchens they work at now. Even if I can’t understand the Indonesian lyrics, I feel the pain and yearning in Rama’s voice and the heavy riffs underneath.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That being said, <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s rhythm game segments are exceptionally hard to read. Each note you play runs down a sheet music-like track, prompting you to press one of the four directional buttons when it reaches the center of the screen. The way it’s presented can be disorienting and frustrating—its use of directional inputs comes with a muscle memory expectation that some of the movement you’re seeing should correlate to which button you’re pressing. Instead, I tripped up a fair bit as notes came from the right side of the screen but required me to press up or down. Rhythm games, like playing a real instrument, are meant to be instinctual. You train yourself on something long enough and it becomes muscle memory embedded in your fingertips. <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s UI design is minimalistic, and doesn’t communicate its mechanics well, so it never quite reaches that level of intuitive rhythm you need to get lost in the music.</p><p>Like Rama’s music, <em>Afterlove EP </em>balances the thorny and heartwarming parts of love and loss. Given what the Pikselnesia team went through to make it happen, it’s not surprising that it understands all the ugly and beautiful parts of losing someone you care about. A lot of <em>Afterlove EP </em>guides you by the hand through the mundane parts of becoming a person again. When you lose parts of yourself, finding something new, good, and healthy to fill that void isn’t always glamorous or fun. It can be awkward and uncomfortable, and require talking to people who see through your bullshit and call you out on it when you can’t see past it yourself. <em>Afterlove EP </em>is sympathetic to the fact that none of us handle grief in a way that is easy to swallow for everyone around us, but its best moments come when it’s willing to slap you across the face and tell you to do better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Phoenix Labs is officially shutting down its free-to-play action RPG Dauntless this spring. In a post on Steam and social media, the studio kept the announcement pretty short and sweet.</p>



<p>“Dauntless is shutting down on May 29, 2025,” the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement reads</a>. “Dauntless will receive no additional content or updates. The game will no longer be available to play on May 29, 2025.”</p>



<p>They closed the social media post, specifically, saying, “Thanks to all for being a part of the Dauntless journey.”</p>



<p>Dauntless’ shutdown comes nearly six years after it first launched in September 2019 for PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. The game had since been released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. </p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-ceo-says-company-will-train-new-ai-on-a-catalog-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft CEO Says Company Will Train New AI On A “Catalog Of Games”</a></h6>



<p>The movealso comes during a tumultuous time for Phoenix Labs as a studio. </p>



<p>In January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming learned</a> that roughly 50 people were let go at the company. There was a belief among those let go at the time that Phoenix Labs as a whole was set to be closed. </p>



<p>As of writing, parent company Forte has yet to make an announcement on the status of the studio. Insider Gaming has reached out, however, to attempt to get clarity on the situation.</p>



<p>At its peak, Phoenix Labs said that Dauntless had seen over 6 million players.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fellowship | Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Just like in WoW's Mythic+ system, players will have a limited amount of time to slay a dungeon's bosses as well as clear out a certain percentage of enemies. Higher difficulty dungeons will have additional modifiers, but will reward better loot upon a successful run, thus enabling players to push even higher difficulty dungeons in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who has run a WoW dungeon in the last decade will feel right at home. However, what's impressive about Fellowship is how it's taken WoW's Mythic+ system but distilled it down to its core, without 20 years of outdated UI elements, need for player-made add-ons to play optimally, or lengthy grinding to level-up new characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Its interface is clean and customizable and enemy attacks are easy to read and react to. Many of the add-ons players need to download in WoW in order to play well, like a threat meter, a way to track party interrupts, or a detailed dungeon map so players can plan effective routes, are baked into Fellowship by default. That makes it far easier for players who may have always been interested in playing WoW's dungeon-heavy endgame, but found the entire thing too confusing and unapproachable, to jump in and understand what's happening at a glance.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether there is a huge audience for a standalone MMO endgame experience minus the whole MMO part is still an open question, but Fellowship looks like it has a lot of the essential pieces in place. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fellowship's open Steam Next Fest playtest</a> will run from February 24 through March 3, with six different heroes for players to choose from. It does not currently have a release date.

Good question, because as cute and wonderful as this trailer and its song might be, I wasn’t sure what the game actually was. Its really confusing that at the end there is a note mentioning that this new game isn’t actually <em>about </em>food or cooking despite the giraffe’s catchy song. </p><p>According to Annapurna Interactive, <em>To a T</em> is being developed by <em>Katamari Damacy </em>creator  Keita Takahashi and is described as a “colorful” “narrative adventure” game. Here’s the official description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>To a T </em>is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it. </p></blockquote><p>I’m down to play this.

But I can do just that in <em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em>, which is planned to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 15. </p><p>And if you want to watch the whole showcase, which featured a new trailer for <em>Wanderstop </em>and news of a PS5 port of<em> Sayonara Wild Hearts</em>, you can watch the entire event below.

<p>The CEO of esports tournament organizer PGL says there have been “concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop” running CS2 events. The most recent PGL event at Cluj-Napoca sold out tickets, despite many teams backing out of the tournament at the last minute.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pgl-ceo-says-anyone-trying-to-monopolize-cs2-will-simply-fail">PGL CEO Says Anyone Trying to Monopolize CS2 “Will Simply Fail”</h2>



<p>Following the conclusive grand finals of PGL Cluj-Napoca, where MOUZ defeated Falcons 3-1, PGL CEO Silviu Stroie <a href="https://x.com/ssilviu/status/1893928028591251706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took to X </a>(formerly known as Twitter) to celebrate. While celebrating the event, Stroie also spoke against the alleged efforts to thwart PGL, and called out those looking to monopolize the CS2 tournament circuit.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Cluj Napoca, this is Romania!!! We finally decided to run an event with audience in our home country and we were all blown away! By far one of our best events ever. We will continue to run CS2 events despite concerted efforts from multiple parties to stop us. Counter-Strike is a global phenomenon and any single company that will try to monopolize it will simply fail. Our next arena event is in May in Astana, where we expect another sold out arena full of [Counter-Strike] fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But who are the parties trying to stop PGL? Stroie’s comment about monopolization suggest he’s referring to the larger competing organizers in ESL and BLAST. Prior to 2025, ESL and BLAST’s primary Counter-Strike leagues featured partnered organizations, which incentivized those teams to prioritize those events over any other ones, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save for Majors</a>. Not only did those teams prioritize ESL and BLAST events, put the partner programs restricted the number of non-partnered teams that could qualify for those events.</p>



<p>These programs were effectively dashed by Valve changes made in 2023 that went into effect at the start of 2025. These changes banned partnership programs between team and organizer, forced all events to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-vrs-in-cs2-valve-regional-standings-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">use Valve rankings</a> or open qualifiers for qualification, and forced organizers to make compensation public. In an attempt to get teams to re-prioritize their events, both ESL and BLAST have publicized new revenue share models. According to HLTV’s Milan “Striker” Švejda, the lack of revenue share <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/57777/striker-reveals-why-several-teams-skipped-pgl-cluj-napoca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">directly led</a> to some of the top teams choosing to skip PGL Cluj-Napoca.</p>



<p>While PGL has not pursued a revenue share model, their Cluj-Napoca event drew praise for its format. Namely, fans were overall pleased to see a meaningful 3rd place match adopted, upping the stakes with an improved result in the Valve rankings and a big prize pool bump.</p>

			<p>It's been announced by publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam that the "<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-is-an-unreal-engine-5-remaster-plus-due-early-next-year/">radically overhauled reawakening</a>" of The Talos Principle will be released on April 10, with its new title being The Talos Principle: Reawakened. This release will see the puzzle game launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. For those who are on PC, a demo is now available to play as part of Steam Next Fest.</p>
<p>Additionally, to celebrate the official launch date, a release date trailer has been released, showing off some of the puzzle editors and the new environments available in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Talos Principle: Reawakened - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SyMjhahRJhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you've played this game before and plan on picking up the remastered version, it will still have the same story that you loved, but now it will look better than ever, as it was rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. As a result, the Simulation world you explore is now more detailed than ever, introducing enhanced textures, lighting, and environmental design to upgrade the experience of the original Talos Principle experience.</p>
<p>Alongside the game, you'll also get to experience the acclaimed expansion, Road to Gehenna, where you'll get the opportunity to play through the new chapter, In the Beginning. This is a brand-new addition that dives into the beginning of the Simulation, where new layers are added to the complex story of The Talos Principle.</p>
<p>For those who enjoy the head-scratching puzzles that are featured in The Talos Principle, there will be a brand new Puzzle Editor, which allows creative minds to create new puzzles for players to take on, as well as new worlds to explore.</p>
<p>If you're unsure whether this game is for you and you're on PC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2806640/The_Talos_Principle_Reawakened/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is a demo</a> for The Talos Principle: Reawakened currently available on Steam. This demo will give you access to a medieval environment where there are plenty of puzzles and challenges to undertake. The puzzles available in the demo have been cherry-picked to showcase some of the key mechanics that are utilized in the game. This includes laser connectors, pressure plates, and force-field jammers.</p>
<p>Along with this, you will be given the opportunity to try out the fully-featured Puzzle Editor, where you can build your own worlds and create your own challenges for other players to take on, giving control back to the dedicated modding community.</p>
<p>The Talos Principle: Reawakened will fully launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam on April 10.</p>
