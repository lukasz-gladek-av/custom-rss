		<p>Funcom has announced that the hotly anticipated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> will launch on 20th May 2025 for PC, priced at $49.99, with the console release remaining TBC.</p>
<p>In the meantime, PC gamers can get a slight headstart with the freely available Character Creator and Benchmark Mode to test your hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The character creator and benchmarking tool is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">available now via Steam</a>, with gamers that download and open it up able to receive a free Frameblade knife skin.</p>
<p>The character creator is themed around the Reverend Mother’s test of the Gom Jabbar, letting you fiddle with ever aspect of your appearance, select your home planet, caste and mentor. This can then be imported into the full game at launch.</p>

<p>The benchmark sequence will use a fly-through of a player-built base in the desert, racing through to Harko Village – the Harkonnen player hub – and conclude with an encounter with a huge sandworm that defines this iconic sci-fi world. This should give a decent baseline to determine your PC performance and adjust graphics settings to meet your goals.</p>
<p>With the success of the recent films, Dune video games have been popping up left and right, with Dune: Awakening one of the most exciting and intriguing in development. Coming from Conan Exiles developer Funcom Oslo, this is a big open world survival MMO.</p>
<p>It definitely feels like survival will be quite tricky here, given the setting. Worms are just one unkillable threat to contend with, as sandstorms, the heat and sunlight, and just finding water in this desert all being particular challenges. Of course, you can band together with other players, sharing resources, building bases, going on raids and quests, and deciding which of the factions vying for control over the planet you wish to align with.</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation support is being integrated into Indiana Jones and the Great Circle with a new game update. As previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, players can take advantage of the new transformer-based DLSS AI model, which improves image quality compared to the previous CNN-based model. Users with the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards can also enable Multi Frame Generation, reaching much higher frame rates on their configurations. And even GeForce RTX 40 GPU owners can take advantage of the updated Frame Generation model, which delivers higher frame rates and consumes less video RAM.</p>
<p>Moreover, MachineGames improved the game's visuals by adding fully ray traced shadows to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. If you own an RTX GPU and use ray tracing, the update also adds DLSS Ray Reconstruction, which replaces multiple denoisers with NVIDIA's unified AI model, improving surface detail, drawing more precise shadows are more precise, enhancing lighting and delivering more accurate reflections. Lastly, the game also includes native DLAA support for those with spare headroom (GeForce RTX 5090 owners, in all likelihood). However, it seems like the new RTX Hair feature didn't make it into this update as previously planned.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™ | DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation &amp; Ray Reconstruction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laTPVKs0nqA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available tomorrow in Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, the campaign mode of the shooter game developed by Team Jade. According to NVIDIA, a GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card can get up to 265.9 average frame rate per second in the game with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance mode (CNN model). For more about Delta Force: Black Hawk Down, check out Kai's hands-on preview of this mode.</p>

<p>As we <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in an earlier article today, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation will also be available starting tomorrow in NetEase's Marvel Rivals with the new patch.</p>
<p>Today is also the launch day for Don't Nod's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-records-bloom-rage-part-1-and-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Part 1</a>, which supports DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation and the DLAA, and Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-did-sega-already-drop-the-gaiden-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>, which features the same NVIDIA technologies.&nbsp;Lastly, Wemade's Unreal Engine 5 powered MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/honor-of-kings-world-to-support-dlss-3-ray-tracing-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legend of Ymir</a>, inspired by Norse mythology, is also live today in South Korea with DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation support.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also released a new Game Ready driver (version 572.47) today to&nbsp;<span>accompany the official launch of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/colorful-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-battle-nx-16-gb-gpu-review-enthusiast-performance-at-749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5070 Ti graphics card</a>. The driver is optimized for the Marvel Rivals DLSS 4 update and fixes some driver stability issues when waking up the </span>monitor from extended sleep time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/615263/xbox-game-pass-microsoft-cloud-gaming-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hello, and welcome to a special episode of <em>Decoder</em>! This is David Pierce, editor-at-large at <em>The Verge</em>. Nilay is off this week for a much-deserved break from what I can only describe as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/612069/fcc-brendan-carr-elon-musk-donald-trump-first-amendment-free-speech-censorship">pretty bleak</a> news cycle. So I’m filling in for him, and the <em>Decoder</em> team thought this would be a good opportunity to switch gears a little bit from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">political apocalypse beat</a> and talk about something completely different. </p><p>So today we’re diving into the video game industry and discussing a particular set of thorny problems facing Microsoft and its Xbox division. Microsoft is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, and for nearly half of that history, Xbox has been a central pillar of the company’s consumer hardware and software businesses. The first Xbox launched in 2001, and it has sat alongside Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo as the Big Three of console gaming for the last quarter century. </p><p>But things in Xbox land have not been that great lately. In fact, Xbox has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad">struggling for quite some time now</a>. And a lot of the issues it’s facing can be traced back to core problems at the heart of software distribution: as video games get more expensive to make, and the demands for their scope, size, and quality become greater, how do you produce certifiable hits that get people to buy your hardware? How do you finance those hits, and when they launch, how do you get them into the hands of more consumers — consumers who may not want to buy an Xbox anymore and balk at the idea of shelling out $70 for a new game?</p><p>Nintendo and Sony seem to have this pretty much figured out, and both companies have been reaping the benefits of dominating the console-gaming market, albeit in different ways, since at least 2017. That’s when the first Switch launched and when it became clear Sony’s PS4 had cemented the PlayStation as the clear winner of the 2010s. But 2017 is also when Microsoft launched Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service designed to be a bit like Netflix for gaming. </p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer developed a master plan to shift the Xbox business model. After the better part of 20 years having proprietary hardware at the center of its strategy, Microsoft pivoted. The idea was it would lean on its expertise in cloud computing and its considerable war chest of software profits from Windows to try something new. It would mix subscription gaming, cloud streaming, and a willingness to put its software on competing platforms to try and break free from a losing race against its rivals. </p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>Eight years later, and well… it hasn’t quite worked out like we might have thought. Xbox is still in a distant third place in the console race, with some estimates putting Xbox hardware sales at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">less than half the number of PS5’s Sony has sold</a>. That’s despite some record-breaking game studio acquisitions that have cost Microsoft almost $100 billion dollars. </p><p>Meanwhile, Nintendo is off in a league of its own. It has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">sold more than 150 million Switch units</a> since that console launched, and the eventual Switch 2, coming later this year, is also expected to be a smash hit.</p><p>So, sure, GamePass is reasonably successful for what it is — but it definitely hasn’t changed the world like Netflix did to Hollywood. People are still mostly buying new games, sometimes even still on a disc from Best Buy or Walmart. Streaming a game to your phone or TV over the cloud remains pretty niche. </p><p>So, what exactly happened here? Why did Microsoft’s master plan not pan out? And can it still succeed if the right combination of factors comes together over the next several years? To break all this down, I invited Ash Parrish, <em>The Verge</em>’s video game reporter, on the show to talk all about the struggles of Xbox and Game Pass, as well as where she sees the future of the game industry headed next. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about the topics we discussed in this episode, check out the links below:</p><div><ul><li><span>Xbox continues its push beyond consoles with new ad campaign | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Why the video game industry is such a mess | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>The next Xbox is going to be very different | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>2025 looks like a great year for Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft prepares to take Xbox everywhere | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft and Google are fighting over the future of Xbox | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313976/microsoft-google-xbox-app-android-future-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft was the No.1 games publisher in the world last December | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-was-the-no-1-games-publisher-in-the-world-last-month/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Xbox games in Game Pass ‘can lose 80% of premium sales’ | <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-games-in-game-pass-can-reportedly-lose-80-of-premium-sales/"><em>VGC</em></a></span></li><li><span>Phil Spencer: No ‘red lines’ over Xbox games coming to Switch, PlayStation | <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft’s Xbox turmoil isn’t slowing down | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242790/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-turmoil-notepad"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li><li><span>Microsoft says Game Pass is profitable as subscription growth slows | <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></li></ul></div><div><div><h2>Decoder with Nilay Patel</h2><p>A podcast from <em>The Verge</em> about big ideas and other problems.</p></div><p><a href="https://pod.link/decoder"><span>SUBSCRIBE NOW!</span></a></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developer Funcom announced that its upcoming multiplayer survival game <em>Dune: Awakening</em> will be launching on Steam on May 20th. But there are a pair of apps launching today that will help tide you over <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112467/dune-awakening-survival-game-preview-xbox-ps5-pc">until you can drink the blood of your enemies</a>.</p><p>First up is the character creator, which appears to take the form of <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Gom_Jabbar">the infamous Gom Jabbar test</a>. According to the developer, you’ll not only be able to set how your character looks but also choose “your home planet, caste, and mentor, be it Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper,” which, in turn, will impact the abilities you have to start the game. Your choices can then carry over when the full game launches.</p><p>Also available today is a benchmark mode, which lets players test their systems to see if they can handle the game. Funcom says that players will be “treated to some epic scenes from the game, including soaring with an ornithopter and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm.” Both the benchmark tool and the character creator are available <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1172710%2FDune_Awakening%2F" rel="sponsored">via Steam</a> for free.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Scuf just announced its latest pro-style controller for Xbox and PC, the first to come close to the $100 price point. The $99.99 Scuf Valor Pro — <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fscufgaming.com%252Fxbox%252Fscuf-valor-pro-steel-gray" rel="sponsored">available for purchase starting today</a> in 15 different styles — isn’t exactly a budget controller in its own right, but context matters.</p><p>I’ve tested the delightfully translucent version of the controller for nearly two weeks now to see where exactly it fits among Scuf’s current Xbox lineup, consisting of the $169.99 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B06VTRJGCP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Instinct</a> and the $219.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price">Instinct Pro</a> (our previous pick for the best pro-style Xbox controller), both wireless. The wired-only and Valor Pro somehow sits in the middle. </p><p>It has the Instinct’s smooth thumb sticks with replaceable tops, now with Hall effect magnetism to reduce the chance of developing stick drift. It also borrows the flagship Instinct’s four programmable rear buttons, its dedicated switch for swapping between its three mapping profiles, and the interchangeable faceplates. </p><p>At the same time, you get the Instinct Pro’s rubberized rear grips (adding comfort while retaining that premium feel) and trigger stops. And yet, neither has the Valor Pro’s dedicated dials to adjust game volume and chat mix, nor the dedicated mute buttons embedded beneath both.</p><p>As a long-time Xbox gamer, I felt at home using the Valor Pro, which still largely takes after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/31/24210403/microsoft-xbox-controller-translucent-blue-model">the official Xbox Wireless Controller’s</a> ergonomic design. Scuf’s refinements to that winning formula seem minimal, but can make a meaningful difference. For example, the bumpers are a bit wider and a few millimeters longer than you’ll find on most controllers, draping further down each side. This makes it easier to shift my finger from the trigger to the bumper. </p><p>I don’t even have to remove my fingers from the triggers to press the bumpers. The design allows me to use the sides of my index fingers to actuate them with a light press. That meant I could lob grenades in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> while staying at the ready for a gunfight or jump out of fights as Doctor Strange in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> without lowering my shield. The travel and feel are consistent across the entire surface, so it doesn’t feel stabby or straining. </p><p>I immediately noticed the redesigned rear paddles, which felt off to me on the Instinct Pro. They’re in roughly the same position as the Instinct’s, designed for all four buttons to be comfortably reachable where your middle and ring fingers drape when gripping the controller.</p><p>But the two inside buttons have a bit more topside surface and use a downward vertical force for actuation instead of the horizontal motion required on the Instinct Pro. They’re easier to press while maintaining control over the bigger side paddles. They also don’t require as much force as they did on the Instinct Pro, but the give isn’t so light that misfires become problematic (and you can disable them entirely, if so).</p><div id=":R5irarr6:"><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div><p>As much as I’ve tried, I’m simply not a back-button gamer. My proportionally stubby fingers combined with cast iron skillets I call palms make it difficult for me to use them effectively in most games. The Scuf Valor Pro is the first controller with four rear buttons that feel natural and don’t make me feel cramped.</p><p>PC gamers will soon get support for a 1KHz polling rate in a post-launch update. That update wasn’t available as of writing, but I’d wager you’d find the intended reduced input lag imperceptible if you aren’t the type to qualify for tournaments. I sure couldn’t tell the difference on other controllers I’ve tested with the feature.</p><p>Should you buy a Valor Pro? That depends. Although you can swap thumbstick sizes and remove two of the rear paddles, it’s not quite as customizable as something like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, but also not nearly as expensive. There are also considerably cheaper wired options with comparable features I’ve tested recently like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Controller-gamepad-Windows-Console/dp/B0D8T82K5C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$69.99 PowerA Fusion Pro 4</a>, which offers four rear buttons, Hall effect sticks with adjustable height, <em>and</em> Hall effect triggers with three stop levels. </p><p>Most don’t remain as faithful to the patented Xbox shape, however, and that might be a deciding factor. Perhaps after an eventual sale, the Valor Pro can be a great first stop for someone new to Scuf, so long as you don’t mind playing with a cable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sometimes it’s not enough. Say, for example, you finish a season early. What then? Well, you could roll a new character and grind to max level a second time…or you could swap games for a bit while you wait for the next <em>Diablo 4 </em>season start date. That’s likely some time in April, so what to do with the next month? Here are a bunch of other ARPGs to enjoy. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-recommend-id="image://b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-recommend-id="image://b347666fb82b7a736efe660d1498214e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sparkly blue lightning is used to kill a baddie on some brown steps." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> How can we talk about <em>Diablo IV</em> without mentioning the reigning free-to-play ARPG champ that launched into Steam Early Access at the end of 2024? <em>Path of Exile 2</em> is a monolith in the genre, with the most impressive, yet daunting, passive skill tree in history, a genuinely massive build variety, multiple end-game modes, and a challenging story mode that borrows from the ever-growing Soulslike genre. You can easily spend 100 hours per character, and there are six of them already in Early Access.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-recommend-id="image://5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Iron Lore Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-recommend-id="image://5e4fd0db91ed5e31e0aff4823e029d6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player fighting satyrs on a bridge in Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s nothing wrong with nostalgia. Do you remember your very first ARPG? For many, it was the original <em>Diablo </em>or one of the numerous <em>Forgotten Realms</em> titles on consoles. But how about <em>Titan Quest</em>? The Greek mythology inspired hack-and-slash holds up well today, especially considering it still receives occasional expansions and updates through its Anniversary Edition. Plus, <em>Titan Quest 2</em> is on the horizon, so delving into a battle against the Greek gods never felt more pertinent.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-recommend-id="image://42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wolcen Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-recommend-id="image://42fd7e48426196da90f6c40be2890c76" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Purple magical mayhem surrounding a red portal gate." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Yes, even so long after its release, <em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem</em> retains its ‘Mixed’ rating on Steam due to poor design choices, bugs, and lackluster end-game content. That said, this is easily one of the most gorgeous ARPGs in the genre, thanks to the power of CryEngine 3, which also powers <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> and <em>Crysis 3</em>. One of the things I like most about <em>Wolcen </em>is its build diversity, allowing you to swap between weapon sets and skills to change up your approach to a dungeon or boss on the fly.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="17ff293d14a4f256b921354eab7060d7" data-recommend-id="image://17ff293d14a4f256b921354eab7060d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The bridge outside of town in Grim Dawn leading to the abandoned village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The bridge outside of town in Grim Dawn leading to the abandoned village." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Crate Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17ff293d14a4f256b921354eab7060d7" data-recommend-id="image://17ff293d14a4f256b921354eab7060d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The bridge outside of town in Grim Dawn leading to the abandoned village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In certain circles, if you mention you’re a fan of any modern ARPG like <em>Diablo 4</em>, you’ll receive messages and replies pointing you toward <em>Grim Dawn</em>. It’s a spiritual successor to the countless hack-and-slash titles many of us grew up playing, like <em>Diablo 2</em>, and it’s a favorite for a reason. The game offers hundreds of items and affixes, crafting, base-building, quests with choices and consequences, and build diversity that allows you to tailor the game to your liking by combining multiple classes into an amalgamation of power and prospect!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-recommend-id="image://d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Runic Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-recommend-id="image://d9312eab48b8201c098a91ae919285a6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colorful spells being cast in a Torchlight 2 battle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Seriously? It’s <em>Torchlight 2</em>! The colorful aesthetic may throw some players for a loop, as its cartoonish appearance belies a serious game created by some of the genre’s grandfathers. The gameplay loop in this exceptional ARPG holds up so well, many years after its release. To many long-time fans, it’s the last in the series. They don’t consider any of the new releases canon. With unique pets, straightforward builds, enthralling loot, and a handful of side activities (like fishing) which can transform and evolve your pet, there’s much to see and do in this old-school hack-and-slash. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-recommend-id="image://309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NeocoreGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-recommend-id="image://309f99f31729013113b2bd6e2ba233f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A plague space marine in Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p> Why did developers take so long to smush together the hack-and-slash genre within the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> universe? Instead of the usual magic, missiles, and cold, hard steel of sword and board fighters, <em>Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr</em> allows players to wield highly explosive grenades, bolters, lasguns, chainswords, and more impressive weaponry from the vast arsenal of the space marines. You’ll traverse the galaxy, fight solo or with up to three other players, upgrade weapons, and run through nearly endless seasonal and end-game content. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a new job listing, Cyberpunk 2077’s sequel will feature “the most realistic and reactive crowd system in any game to date.”</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-most-realistic-and-reactive-crowd-system-job" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, the new information was revealed through Pawel Sasko’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1892298966961725540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, which talks about seven job openings for the “next Cyberpunk.” If you dig a little deeper into the daily responsibilities of Lead Encounter Designer, the listing implies that CD Project Red is working on creating the most advanced crowd system to date for the next Cyberpunk, with a focus on the realism and reactiveness of the NPCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The community has started sharing their views on this upcoming crowd system for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1itiifo/cyberpunk_sequel_has_new_opening_for_lead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cyberpunkgame</a> subreddit. The players are discussing whether the developers should work on an entirely new city or improve and evolve the existing Night City to flesh it out even more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have compared the crowd system for games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V with the original Cyberpunk 2077. Some also wonder whether the next Cyberpunk’s crowd system will be able to beat what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the details about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel are currently unknown. All we know is that it is internally referred to as Project Orion. The developers have also stated that Cyberpunk’s plot is a “uniquely American story” with “punk energy”, and thanks to the Boston studio, the sequel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-sequel-more-american/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feel&nbsp;more American</a>.&nbsp;</p>

When I first heard about the game, I was absolutely thrilled, and now that it has become a reality, I couldn’t be happier. I was especially surprised to learn that the game is being developed in the Netherlands! It felt amazing to say ‘Tenkamuteki no Daishōri!!’ (‘Unrivaled, ultimate victory!!’) again. I love Yattarou so much!”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichiro Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Hearing Kon-chan (Ko’on-no-Kami) and Gen-chan (Gennarisai) banter, Kenyū-san’s witty narration, and the Nyankī squad’s signature introductions—it was like stepping back into the recording studio from all those years ago. I was also blown away by how faithfully the trailer recreated the original animation style. The love and dedication from the Dutch development team truly shine through. And of course, a big thank you to Seiichiro Yamashita for bringing Sukashii to life!”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamaguchi:</strong> “Congratulations on 35 years of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>! Over time, I’ve been hearing more and more people say, ‘I loved Teyandee!’ and it makes me so happy. The fact that this series continues to be loved not only in Japan but also overseas is truly special. This is a work that I will cherish forever, and Yattarou will always be an irreplaceable part of my career.”</p><p><strong>■ Ai Orikasa (Pururun)</strong></p><p><strong>How did it feel to record Pururun’s voice again after so long?</strong></p><p><strong>Ai Orikasa:</strong> “I was deeply moved by the quality of the visuals. The passion of the game development team for this series was so evident, and it made me incredibly happy. Seeing Ko-on-no-Kami and Gennarisai’s interactions was exciting, and I was delighted to say Pururun’s signature catchphrase once again.”</p><p><strong>What was it like reuniting with the original cast? And what are your thoughts on Seiichirō Yamashita joining as the new voice of Sukashii?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even after 35 years, this series remains as vibrant as ever in my heart. The moment I stepped into the studio with Kappei-san and the rest of the team, Pururun’s lines just came naturally. Seiichirō Yamashita did a fantastic job as Sukashii—he really captured the character’s essence.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as Samurai Pizza Cats?</strong></p><p><strong>Orikasa:</strong> “Even our post-recording gatherings (laughs) were a blast! I truly believe the camaraderie among the cast and crew translated into what audiences loved about the show. It is such an honor to be part of a series that continues to be cherished after all these years. Please continue to support <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>!”</p><p><strong>■ Seiichiro Yamashita (Sukashii)</strong></p><p><strong>Were you familiar with <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> before? What was your experience recording for the trailer?</strong></p><p><strong>Seiichiro Yamashita:</strong> “To be honest, I wasn’t familiar with Kyatto Ninden Teyandee before this project. It’s incredible to be involved with a series that predates my birth. The recording session was truly special—I had the privilege of performing alongside legends like Kappei Yamaguchi, watching them work up close in such a dynamic setting.”</p><p><strong>How did you feel about taking over the role of Sukashii from your senior colleague Jurota Kosugi?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Even now, I feel like it’s too great an honor to say I’ve ‘inherited’ the role. This is my first time stepping into a character previously portrayed by another actor, and I was deeply conscious of preserving the image of Sukashii that fans hold dear. The encouragement from the production team was invaluable, and this has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for me.”</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on the 35th anniversary of <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em>, which continues to be loved both in Japan and overseas as <em>Samurai Pizza Cats</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yamashita:</strong> “Stories have a way of leaving lasting impressions on people, and the love for <em>Kyatto Ninden Teyandee</em> has endured over decades.

<section><p>Comfort, function, and convenience come together to produce a phenomenal option for Xbox and PC players if you don't mind the wire</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In order to be successful, a controller needs three things: comfort, function, and convenience. There's a reason why the Duke--the notoriously large controller that accompanied the original Xbox in 2001--was eventually replaced with a smaller design, durable as it was. The Duke was heavy and huge, with buttons spread out a little too far across the interface.</p><p dir="ltr">Scuf's newest controller, the Valor Pro Wired Controller for Xbox and PC, nails all three of these elements. Its light weight and smooth front faceplate makes it easy to carry and hold without irritation. The design of the bumpers and triggers on the top of the controller make it very simple to alternate between, while the four rear paddles offer extra control in tight situations. A few other additional features--like built-in audio controls--add additional convenience. It's not reinventing the wheel, but the Valor Pro is a great choice for Xbox and PC players alike, provided you can live with a wire attached to whatever you're playing on.</p><p dir="ltr">Right out of the box, the Valor Pro felt great in my hands, which are larger than most. The placement of the buttons and sticks seem to slot right into the positions my hands want them to be. It's surprisingly light in the hands too, to the point where it feels like a toy rather than a pro controller. That's not to say it feels cheap, though, as the sticks, buttons, and d-pad feel strong to the touch. The smooth faceplate creates a tight grip, and the nonslip grips work as advertised, no matter how sweaty the palms get--and I, a person with pretty sweaty hands, would know.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks on the Valor Pro are especially comfortable thanks to a ridged fabric-like border on the outside rim. There's no hard edge to irritate the thumb; instead, that fabric serves as a nice cushion when I'm blasting people in Fortnite or Call of Duty. The sticks should last a while too, as the Valor Pro contains Hall Effect anti-drift measures to keep them precise longer. There was no drift to speak of during this review--which, if there were, would be a huge issue for a brand-new controller--and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. Meanwhile, the d-pad's contoured shape fits the thumb nicely, and where other controller d-pads sometimes feel flimsy, this one has some weight to it with every touch.</p><p dir="ltr">The four back paddles on the controller are the most impressive thing on it, as each one avoids a common pitfall I've experienced with back buttons for some time: They resist accidental button presses. I've routinely pressed a button on the back of a controller at inopportune times, usually in quiet moments where stealth is key, and it immediately turns my strategy into mush. These paddles feel more like front face buttons than any I've used before, and that feeling has resulted in zero accidental activations during this review period.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valor Pro also offers controller profiles, where you can alternate between three different button designations for the back buttons. One is specific for shooters, and puts the change-weapon and reload buttons in the back; another is for sports games and assigns the A and B buttons back there, which helps with, for example, easy shooting and passing in NBA 2K. The third profile is for racing games, turning each back button into a different direction, and while I wasn't quite as enamored with that profile, the experience wasn't so bad that it killed the convenience of the other two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446762"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4446762-ambushpr_1200x675_hero3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If none of those profiles fit for you, the Valor Pro’s custom remapping feature lets you set each profile to the buttons you use the most in the games you play the most. Remapping is simple; each profile is set to a different color, and if you hold in the profile button on the back until the colored LED blinks, you can then assign paddles to buttons however you like. Controller customization is increasingly becoming the standard, and the Valor Pro's version gets the job done.</p><p dir="ltr">If you plug a headset into your Valor Pro, you’ll have extra control over the audio thanks to the controller’s built-in volume knobs. The left knob on the bottom of the controller handles in-game audio, while the knob to its right focuses on chat volume, and both can be pressed down to mute the corresponding audio. Having these controls onboard the controller is super convenient, not to mention the knobs are, like the rest of the buttons on the Valor Pro, placed in a comfortable spot for your fingers to reach.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite its execution, the Valor Pro doesn't provide much in the way of <em>new</em> features. At $99, it sits in the "budget pro" controller tier with options like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> and Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot--or, at about two-thirds the price, the 8BitDo Ultimate. Those offer similar features to what the Valor Pro is doing here. Still, Scuf has done a great job designing this controller to feel like the top of the line rather than the less expensive option.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also the matter of that pesky wire. Wired controllers are fine if your gaming setup allows for it, but wireless controllers are also popular for a reason--and something like the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra, Razer Wolverine V3 Pro or Xbox Elite 2 offers those options on a wireless controller for a similar price. It's true that latency is reduced with a wired controller, and Scuf's focus on precision calls for a low-latency solution, which something like a wire provides.</p><p dir="ltr">Again, people with close-quarters gaming setups won't be worried about this, but if your Xbox is across the room from your couch, the Valor Pro being shackled to the system likely won't work for you--even with the 10-foot USB-C cord included with the controller; a wireless controller works better than a potential tripping hazard.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I am very pleased with the Scuf Valor Pro. It's one of the most comfortable controllers I've ever used, with buttons placed so naturally that it's as if the controller was made for my hands specifically. The back paddles are fully customizable and resistant to frantic accidental pushes, the smooth grip keeps the controller in my hand no matter how wild a gameplay session gets, and the built-in audio controls give me easy access to both game sound and chat audio. A wireless version would have been great, but even with the wire, the Scuf Valor Pro is a fantastic option for your next Xbox or PC controller.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Valor Pro Wired Controller is available now for $99 at select retailers and at scufgaming.com.</p>

<p>The creator, of course, has players popping their hand in the box and taking the Gom Jabbar test, just like in the novels and films. Players can "fine-tune every aspect" of their look, plus choose a home planet, caste, and mentor (Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper), the latter of which will determine starting abilities.</p>

<p>The PC release in May will be followed by PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>And while the game has been in closed beta testing for a year, May will bring a full release on PC, not early access.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening is an open world, multiplayer survival game set on Arrakis that draws from both Frank Herbert's sci-fi novels and Denis Villeneuve's film adaptations.</p>
<p>"You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within," said our Bertie when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">previewed Dune: Awakening</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Prologue is the start of something. When you understand what Brendan Greene and the team at PlayerUnknown Productions are attempting to create – its ambition, its scope, its real-world applications – then you can understand both the blazing focus of Greene’s vision, and why Prologue: Go Wayback! is a compartmentalised start within a new digital world.</p>
<p>Brendan Greene is a modern day video game rock star. There’s little other way to describe a man who redefined the online shooter, first via the modding scene for Arma and DayZ, and then by building <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pubg">PUBG Battlegrounds</a>. It’s afforded him a unique position, creating PlayerUnknown Productions, and letting him head off to experiment and explore what is possible, not just within video games, but in the way we communicate and interact with each other digitally. It’s wildly ambitious, and almost too big for even his own team to fully grasp. But first, there’s Prologue.</p>



<p>Prologue is a survival game, set within a map that changes every single time you play. That, in and of itself, isn’t particularly groundbreaking. We’ve seen No Man Sky, Valheim and others match survival crafting to a procedurally generated world, but Prologue is taking a different approach to it because this is, the team hope, a new beginning for the creation of worlds.</p>
<p>Prologue marries machine learning with procedural generation, systems that are interlocked and intertwined in such a way that they can create surprising, meaningful landscapes. The difference here is scale. While Prologue’s map is an ‘achievable’ 8km x 8km (for context, that’s the size of Skyrim’s map), it’s also a proof of concept that sits alongside the Preface: Undiscovered World tech demo, with the end goal of creating a system that can form and create whole planets, whole ecosystems – sitting down to talk, Greene utters the word ‘Metaverse’, but is obviously conflicted about doing so.</p>

<p>He leans in, broadening the scope of what they’re working on, saying, “I hate using the word Metaverse. I really do, because it’s got such a dirty stink to it now, right? Because no one’s building it. The metaverse is the internet, but in 3D essentially, that’s what we’re trying to do here. I’m trying to provide an open-source world creation engine, like the [Star Trek] Holodeck, where it’s quite easy for you to create your own world, your own experience, your own part of the world.”</p>

<p>Prologues come first, though, and our early look gives us a clear picture of the first game in this project. We’re met with the immediate instruction that Prologue is a hard game, with Creative Director Scott Davidson telling us, “If you find that it’s easy, it’s probably a bug”. We’ve been given a window into an early, though perfectly functional build, but there’s a sense of fact-finding, testing the water to see how our small group of press get through this initial demonstration.</p>
<p>Prologue has a simple and straightforward goal: make it to the weather station. That simple task is warped, moulded and wrangled by the resources you have access to, your ability to read a map and visual topography, and the weather. Here, the greatest enemies to your survival are a lack of food, water or setting out into the bitter, deadly cold of a snowstorm.</p>
<p>You’re dropped into a cabin. It contains a selection of necessary tools, like a map and compass, as well as a hammer for making repairs and a pair of binoculars for looking out across the world. Hopefully, there’s also some food lurking in the drawers or in the fruit bowl on the counter, and you can fill up your inventory with as much as your small backpack is capable of carrying. Besides that, you’ve got four fast-access equipment slots, and then you can’t carry any more.</p>

<p>You can feel the legacy, and the cadence of Greene’s PUBG. Battle Royale fans will recognise the drive to collect better equipment, to make the most of their starting loadout, and the need to set out across the map in search of the end game. That’s the Weather Station, and while it’s reductive to say that it feels as though success is hard won, this is a game that seems to delight in killing you. Death by exposure, starvation or dehydration come quickly and repeatedly, and though its painful, a streak of realism is at the heart of the team’s drive.</p>
<p>Your immediate decision is whether to run out the door, or to stay in the relative safety of your cabin, exploring, gathering and preparing for the long journey to the weather station. Depending on where you drop, the station will be between 3 and 6 kilometres away, introducing the element of chance and variety that it feels as though will be a hallmark of both Prologue, and its ambitious technology.</p>
<p>I play PUBG like a game of hide and seek, with an unwelcome surprise for you or the seeker at the end of the game. It’s little surprise that I gravitated to shoring up my cabin, staying warm by keeping a fire going, and repairing broken windows to keep the heat in. You can stay here for hours if you want, but aside from your essential food supplies, there is a finite supply of diesel for your generator. It gives some urgency to your foraging, assuming you want to keep the lights on. Heading out, collecting more and better equipment, each of these tiny successes micro doses of dopamine have the effect you’d expect. You want to play more, and you want to get to the weather station.</p>
<p>From the creaking of the trees in the wind to the constant crunch of your footsteps through the world, there’s a bleakness and loneliness of spirit to the game’s central loop that some might find unsettling. Brendan hopes that people will take time to appreciate that time alone though, saying, “Prologue is a lonely space, but you can just wander in the forest, set up your cabin, make it nice and cozy, sit there by the fire, right, and just have it on the background while you read a book. Then you can just read a book in front of your computer – you don’t actually have to play the game.”</p>

<p>Once again, that speaks to a game and an experience that hopes to be more than its base parts. Early Access is the perfect way to introduce the world to Prologue. This is a game that’s mid-development, and which, the team say, needs the community to help direct it moving forward. Scott tells us, “We’re making the type of game that would be very hard to make without player feedback. You can’t focus group your way to success.” He continued, “It needs that back and forth from the community, it needs for them to be engaged in the process, and to want to build something.”</p>
<p>Prologue is undoubtedly part of an exploration. One part technological and another fundamental to the human experience. Striving to survive in an ever-changing world, learning to appreciate the sounds and the solitude of that journey. It’s an ongoing process, one that has potential and pitfalls, but it feels as though this could be the start of something. A prologue to our digital future that rests on the most fundamental human need – it’s a glorious and tantalising juxtaposition.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has announced the release date of its upcoming game, Dune: Awakening. Previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled for Q1 2025</a> on PC, the survival MMO will now debut on May 20, priced at $49.99. Pre-orders will begin soon, said Funcom, promising the in-game bonus Terrarium of Muad’Dib, a beautiful in-base decoration that houses the iconic desert mouse.</p>
<p>Even more interestingly, the Norwegian developer has released both benchmark and character creator. Players can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download</a> the former to check how well their PC will run the Unreal Engine 5-powered Dune: Awakening while the benchmark goes through an ornithopter flight and a dramatic encounter with a colossal sandworm. With the latter, players will be able to create their characters starting today, which will then be importable into the full game on May 20.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DA_MuadibCage_2K_02-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>They must undergo the Gom Jabbar test and fine-tune every aspect of their appearance, as well as pick their home planet, their caste, and their mentor, which is tied to different combat schools: Swordmaster, Bene Gesserit, Mentat, or Trooper. This choice also determines the player character's starting abilities, though the game later opens up access to all schools, letting players mix and match abilities from any of them to create their own play styles. Those who play both benchmark and character creator will get a complimentary Frameblade knife skin at launch.</p>
<p>Funcom <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-develop-games-dune-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">secured the license</a> to develop Dune games in early 2019, before any of the movies were released. Shortly afterward, they were <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-offers-to-fully-acquire-funcom-scope-of-dune-survival-game-to-be-increased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Tencent, which allowed them to increase the scope of this project. Now, the studio is calling this 'the most ambitious survival game ever made', and it might just be correct based on what we've seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2J60DGHWLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can find our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-hands-on-preview-before-the-spice-can-flow-one-must-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developer Q&amp;A</a> at the respective hyperlinks. On PC, the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjnEiP9a9kQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a> for owners of the new GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards. A console version of Dune: Awakening is highly likely, but will come at a later date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-evidence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has responded to a lawsuit brought against it by ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett, whose employment was terminated by the&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>developer last year following allegations of misconduct.</p>

<p>Barrett brought the suit against Sony in December, alleging that the company, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-is-acquiring-destiny-2-developer-bungie" rel="nofollow">is Bungie's parent</a>, engaged in a "sham" investigation in order to support its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-director-fired-report-bungie" rel="nofollow">termination of his contract</a>.</p>

<p>However, as spotted by Stephen Totilo of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game File</a>, Sony has now filed a response, and the 128-page document contains evidence that Sony says reveals Barrett's "pattern of misconduct" with regard to his communications with female employees.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=HzhTMBAC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-destiny-2-sony-lawsuit.jpg?itok=uuMNcmc8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-Bungie employee Christopher Barrett is suing Sony, but Sony has a thing or two to say about that.</figcaption></figure><p>As you can probably imagine, the document is extremely extensive and exhaustive. It contains answers to many of Barrett's claims in his own suit, but most explosively, it includes several exchanges Sony says are evidence of Barrett's attitude towards female employees.</p>

<p>The exchanges include Barrett allegedly telling a female employee she was "hot" and asking her what she thought her best and worst physical features were, as well as telling another employee he would "hit on [her]" if she wasn't being treated well by her boyfriend.</p>

<p>He asked the same employee what "the steps one would have to take" to date her were, asking "what's the strategy guide". To another victim, he said he didn't want her boyfriend to "get the right idea" about the messages he was sending her.</p>

<p>There are several more text exchanges like these, and if they are indeed legitimate, then I think they're pretty damning with regards to Sony's motive for firing Barrett.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=l_rlxe0h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/christopher-barrett-sony-lawsuit-halo-3.jpg?itok=5lJq3S9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Christopher Barrett has also worked on Bungie games like&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony goes on to say that Barrett's "predatory behavior" caused his victims to "seek guidance" from other employees on how to manage his "constant boundary-pushing".</p>

<p>Victims reported to HR that they were "afraid for their jobs during" the encounters with Barrett, but Sony says these employees were "placed...in a vulnerable position" in which they "felt compelled to engage with" Barrett in order to maintain "good standing".</p>

<p>In Barrett's original suit, he says he was a "scapegoat" for Sony and Bungie and that he was "falsely" accused of sexual misconduct, which Sony says is "outrageous considering the evidence". The company says the evidence provided in the document "will demonstrate his termination...was justified".</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see where this lawsuit goes next; none of this represents a definitive conclusion, of course, and Barrett will doubtless have responses prepared for Sony in due course. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Supergiant Games has dropped the hot Warsong Update for Hades 2’s Early Access phase. It welcomes a ton of new content to the Underworld, including a new God, more content on the surface, and thousands of new voice lines, and it also gives us a peak into the next major update and addresses the full release.</p>



<p>Hades 2 Early Access is about the most reassuring content I played in 2024. I was worried the sequel wouldn’t be able to live up to the towering expectations of its predecessor. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-play-hades-before-hades-2-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades</a> was a success inside and out and introduced thousands (daresay millions) of gamers to the roguelike realm. Thankfully, Hades 2 Early Access is encouraging, and its Warsong Update is the next step toward completion.</p>



<p>The developer has explained everything you can find in the major update. It has so much for you to explore and find. But we also know even more is coming.</p>

<h3 id="h-ares-has-arrived">Ares Has Arrived</h3>



<p>People not familiar with history can conceivably confuse Kratos with the God of War. In Norse mythology, it’s actually Tyr, but in classic Greek, it’s Ares. Hades 2 introduces Ares as a new God Melinoe can encounter.</p>



<p>His primary function is to interact with the Princess of the Underworld. But Ares also has a line of his own Boons to choose from.</p>



<h3 id="h-surface-tension">Surface Tension</h3>



<p>Supergiant Games says the Warsong update makes life above the Underworld even more dangerous: “Are you prepared for the&nbsp;Final Confrontation&nbsp;on the surface? Discover what lies beyond the Guardian of&nbsp;Olympus…if you dare!”</p>



<p>I haven’t reached it myself yet, but a new fight likely awaits. Make sure your loadout and setup are ready by the time you reach it.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-animal-familiar-amp-over-2-000-voice-lines-added">New Animal Familiar &amp; Over 2,000 Voice Lines Added</h3>



<p>One of Hades 2’s newest features over the original is Animal Familiars. You need to unlock the ability, but once you do, Melinoe can be joined by one of several creatures. The Warsong Update adds “<strong>One last animal companion</strong> to join your journey and aid you in battle.”</p>



<p>Plus, crank up the audio as “More than&nbsp;2,000 new voice lines&nbsp;and new events with most of the game’s cast!” have been implemented. This likely means all existing Gods have new lines to hear. Plus, Ares’ new dialog likely contributes to a large part of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-next-hades-2-early-access-major-content-update">Next Hades 2 Early Access Major Content Update</h2>



<p><strong>The developer has already announced the third major content update for Hades 2 is in the works and will be released “some months from now.”</strong></p>



<p>Early Access doesn’t stand still for long. It’s a chance for a game developer to keep improving a game, make it better, and present an excellent product before release. Hades 2 has already had two sizable updates, and the third one is already in development. </p>



<p>Given that we’ve had two major updates in nine months, I would expect the third major update to drop around <strong>July or August</strong> time.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-hades-2-release-date-is">Do we Know When Hades 2 Release Date is?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Supergiant Games still can’t pinpoint the full release for Hades 2, saying: <strong>“It’s still too early to share our plans, including when our v1.0 launch will be.”</strong></p>

                <p>Like previous games in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-release-date-trailer-news/2900-6171/">WWE 2K25</a> features a Showcase mode that will let fans relive the past by taking part in several legendary matches. Essentially an interactive documentary--and hosted by "The Wise Man" Paul Heyman this year--2K Showcase: The Bloodline Dynasty will also allow players to alter the outcomes of these matches.</p><p>The trip down wrestling memory lane features a selection of classic bouts, including Yokozuna's infamous battle against Hulk Hogan at the 1993 King of the Ring, the brutal No Holds Barred match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Rikishi, and the Royal Rumble 2022 showdown between Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins.</p><p>Each match fits into one of three categories--Relive History, Change History, and Create History--and in total, 15 of them have been revealed so far. Here's the full list:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnz8zsUmIBA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tnz8zsUmIBA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h3>Relive History</h3><ul><li>Yokozuna (with Mr. Fuji) vs. Hulk Hogan -- King of the Ring 1993</li><li>Rocky Maivia vs. Hunter Hearst Helmsley -- RAW February 13, 1997</li><li>Nia Jax vs. Lyra Valkyria -- Queen of the Ring 2024</li><li>The Usos vs. The New Day (with Big E) -- Hell in a Cell 2017</li><li>Solo Sikoa vs. Carmelo Hayes (with Trick Williams) -- NXT September 13, 2022</li></ul><h3>Change History</h3><ul><li>The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) vs. The Steiner Brothers -- WrestleMania IX</li><li>Rikishi vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin -- No Mercy 2000</li><li>Umaga (with Armando Estrada) vs. John Cena -- New Year's Revolution 2007</li><li>Tamina vs. Natalya vs. Carmella vs. Charlotte Flair vs. Becky Lynch -- Money in the Bank 2017</li><li>Naomi vs. Bayley -- Super ShowDown 2020</li><li>Roman Reigns vs. Seth Rollins -- Royal Rumble 2022</li></ul><h3>Create History</h3><ul><li>High Chief Peter Miavia vs. George "The Animal" Steele</li><li>The Wild Samoans (Afa and Sika) vs. The Dudley Boyz</li><li>The OG Bloodline vs. New Bloodline in WarGames</li><li>The Islanders (Haku and Tama) vs. The Street Profits</li></ul><p>Showcase Mode is typically one of the biggest highlights of a WWE 2K game, but this year's version of the mode is a big departure from previous instances, as it focuses on the Anoa'i family instead of a single superstar. The last couple of years in WWE programming have seen Roman Reigns, Jey Uso, Jimmy Uso, Solo Sikoa, and several other members of that extended wrestling dynasty rise to prominence, while other WWE legends like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, the late Umaga, and the Wild Samoans have all been praised for their contributions to the sports entertainment industry.</p><p>Beyond the Showcase mode, you can also hop on a boat and head to The Island--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-shows-off-its-new-open-world-island-mode-for-the-first-time/1100-6529460/">a new social space</a> that looks like it was heavily inspired by NBA 2K's The City--take part in custom exhibition matches, and chart your own rise to the top as part of the MyRise mode. WWE 2K25 will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, and PS4 on March 14, but if you purchase the Deadman Edition or The Bloodline Edition, you'll get into the game a week early on March 7.</p><p>"With another interesting Showcase subject, fun new match types, and subtly cool new camera controls, I really liked what I played of WWE 2K25," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25-like-cody-rhodes-explores-what-comes-after-you-finish-the-story/1100-6529209/">WWE 2K25 preview</a>. "There's a lot more to see, including several major modes like the narrative-driven MyRise, and the card-collecting MyFaction, and possibly the most impactful of them all: the new social space called The Island, so I'll reserve my final opinion for when I review the game later this year."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Not only can you do it yourself in Design Home, but now the game will let you become your own DIY star for HGTV with a new collaboration. For starters, a Fixer to Fabulous crossover has already kicked off in the mobile title. Next up are weekly challenges based on House Hunters, one of the most popular shows on the network.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fixer to Fabulous crossover began February 19 in Design Home, with weekly challenges called Bentonville Beauty and Arkansas Amazement. The partnership will also be reciprocated. An upcoming episode of Fixer to Faborlous--set to air on March 25--will see hosts Dave and Jenny Marrs playing the mobile title.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMhq6vyZKv0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WMhq6vyZKv0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There's no date yet for the House Hunters challenges; EA says they will be coming soon. The company also states Design Home has seen 131 million players worldwide, and the HGTV collaboration isn't the first partnership for the game. For example, almost a year ago, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/design-home/news/design-home-sims-freeplay-interior-design-series" rel="nofollow ">renovation game partnered up with Sims Freeplay</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Design Home launched in 2016 and wasn't originally under EA's umbrella. That changed, however, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-completes-acquisition-of-glu-mobile-in-2-1-billion-deal/1100-6490777/">the company acquired Glu Mobile for $2.1 billion</a> in 2021. Design Home is still free-to-play but features in-app purchases. EA touts that actual brands, such as West Elm and Pottery Barn, can be utilized to decorate interior rooms in the game.</p>

                <p>The recent announcement that NetEase was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laying off some of its US-based Marvel Rivals developers</a>, including one of the game's directors, prompted concern and questions given that the hero shooter is performing well in the market <a href="https://ir.netease.com/system/files-encrypted/nasdaq_kms/assets/2025/02/20/3-04-13/Q4%202024%20Earnings%20Release.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with 40 million players</a>. Now, a clearer picture of what's going on and the context behind the shocking decision is coming into focus.</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://nikopartners.com/chinese-video-game-companies-are-adapting-their-us-strategies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published a report</a> in which he offered his take. Ahmad said there is "some truth" to how various Chinese game companies are downsizing their US operations due in part to "geopolitical risks" under the new Trump administration. However, there may be more to the story. Ahmad said the "full picture is more nuanced" and might also reflect NetEase performing a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p><p>In addition to the layoffs at the Marvel Rivals team at NetEase is Seattle--under a dozen people were reportedly affected--NetEase made a number of other significant drawbacks to its global games business. Ahmad pointed out how NetEase either closed or scaled down funding for Ouka Studio in Japan, Worlds Untold in Canada, and Jar of Sparks in the US. More recently, Just Cause creator Christopher Sundberg's new studio Liquid Swords announced cuts, as did Halo Infinite co-developer SkyBox Labs in Canada. Both teams were funded in part by NetEase.</p><p>"NetEase aggressively expanded its overseas footprint between 2019 and 2023, opening and investing in numerous studios outside China with the aim to develop high-end PC and console games," Ahmad said. "NetEase's recent decisions regarding its overseas investments and studio operations reflect a broader recalibration of its global strategy, driven by multiple factors. This change in strategy has impacted both US based studios and non-US based studios."</p><p>Ahmad went on to note that the "core" development team for Marvel Rivals is based in Guangzhou, China. This includes a second game director, Guangyun Chen, alongside the US-based director, Thaddeus Sasser, who was let go this week.</p><p>Also in his note, Ahmad said NetEase and other Chinese giants like Tencent and miHoYo invested significantly in overseas games and teams to try to reach players globally. However, Ahmad said a "turning point" for Chinese companies came in 2024 when Black Myth: Wukong, developed by a relatively small Chinese team at Game Science, broke out and became a giant success.</p><p>"The success of Black Myth: Wukong challenged the industry's assumption that only Western or Japanese AAA studios could produce globally competitive PC and console titles," Ahmad said.</p><p>So why did NetEase cut its US-based Marvel Rivals development team? We may never know the real answer, but Ahmad said it has more to do with "high costs and lower returns" over the past few years following a pullback after the boom of the pandemic. "Therefore, streamlining operations helps reduce costs and shorten development cycles, and NetEase is now following a new strategy both for these reasons and to mitigate risk from US-China policy changes," he said.</p><p>It's not just NetEase that's scaling back operations in the US, as the US video game industry has undergone turbulent times of late, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">thousands of layoffs rocking the business in the past few years.</a> These cuts come as some US-based video game companies, <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including Electronic Arts, continue to see huge profits.</a></p>

Sony's often keen to be careful of high-profile conversations like this, and the pair had a rare opportunity to speak frankly about the highs and lows of creative leadership.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Sony was probably happier with how this conversation went compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/sony-apologizes-after-completely-botching-interview-with-naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann">his previous public conversation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with another PlayStation employee...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Druckmann (who is also studio president at Naughty Dog, and executive produced the HBO series The Last of Us based on the video game of the same name), shared one anecdote that stood out in a conversation about grappling with self-doubt and "putting faith in the process." As he and Barlog mused about why they stay in game development despite the stress, Druckmann indicated he's been thinking about the need for studio leaders to move up the ladder to create space for the next generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He recalled a conversation with Naughty Dog co-founder Jason Rubin where the former studio boss expanded on his decision to leave the company.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-controversy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The portrayal of a real-life religious shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has prompted officials at the shrine's real-world counterpart to take "action", according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per Japanese platform <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20250220-PF3AE6LOHRA6DGWT3APVNP6GLI/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sankei News</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-real-life-japanese-shrine-officials-are-taking-action-over-ubisofts-portrayal-of-religious-site/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), officials at the Itate Hyozu Shrine, which is located in the Hyogo Prefecture and which can be visited in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' historical representation of Japan, are taking "appropriate action" over the shrine's depiction in the game.</p>

<p>Specifically, the officials appear to be taking umbrage at the fact that it's possible not only to visit the shrine in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but also to destroy parts of said shrine, "including its altar and sacred objects" (as Automaton puts it).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=WNKK05DQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-naoe.jpg?itok=1HC68NHq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has angered officials at a real-life Japanese shrine.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, the shrine's destruction isn't part of the game's main quest, and it also hasn't been used for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' promotional cycle, but that hasn't stopped some calling the very ability to destroy the shrine disrespectful.</p>

<p>Sankei News reports that shrine officials said they "would have refused" if Ubisoft had contacted them for official approval to include the shrine in the game, but that they were not approached by the studio.</p>

<p>It's not exactly clear what the Itate Hyozu shrine officials mean by "appropriate action"; that phrase is ambiguous, and it could mean anything from legal action through to simply requesting the shrine be removed from the game and anything in between.</p>

<p>In any case, it's far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has gotten into trouble regarding its historical accuracy or reverence for Japan. Back in July, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">apologized after including a Japanese re-enactment group's flag</a> in a book of concept art without the group's permission.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=3sFrmaN0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-shrine-portrayal-combat.jpg?itok=Hj1_taXh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has found itself at the center of a controversy.</figcaption></figure><p>There's also an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">ongoing controversy surrounding protagonist Yasuke</a>, who's depicted in the game as a samurai, a classification that some folks are disputing from a historical perspective (although I rather suspect there's an unpleasant <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ulterior motive</a> to that argument in many cases).</p>

<p>Figurine company PureArts also issued an apology in October after pulling an "insensitive" figurine from sale. The figurine in question depicted a one-pillared Torii gate, a symbol that can famously be found at the Nagasaki Sanno shrine, which stands as a memorial to the devastation caused by the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>Ubisoft will be banking on&nbsp;the success of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>after what has been a rough year for the company. Flops like&nbsp;<em>Skull and Bones&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, as well as repeated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-march" rel="nofollow">delays</a> to&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>itself, mean the game is carrying rather a lot on its back.</p>

<p>If Ubisoft itself is to be believed, however, pre-orders for the game are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"solid"</a>, so the company may well have another big hit on its hands come March, when&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-presents-february-2025-officially-revealed-for-next-week.1114269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has officially announced a Pokemon Presents presentation for next week, and as you've probably come to expect by now, it's set to air on Pokemon Day.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/pokemon/status/1759850669333160265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the Pokemon X account, the latest Pokemon Presents showcase is set for February 27th at 6am Pacific. That's around 9am Eastern and about 2pm GMT, in case you're wondering.</p>

<p>We don't yet know how long the showcase will be, but previous Pokemon Presents videos have been anywhere from around 10 minutes long to about 25 minutes, so expect something that's somewhere in that time range.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=7PfFw3mp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-presents-february-2025-announced-legends-z-a.jpg?itok=L2p6k6D_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could we finally be about to get more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info?</figcaption></figure><p>If past form is anything to go by, we can probably expect some updates for currently-running&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Masters EX</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Cafe Remix</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>(whose developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor" rel="nofollow">might be about to sell up to Saudi Arabia's PIF</a>).</p>

<p>We can potentially also expect a new announcement or two, so this showcase might give us our first glimpse of the next major generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>The timing would track; the mainline games have been launching roughly every three years for the past few generations, and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, so this year feels like the perfect time to announce whatever the next games will be.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which is the Copperajah in the room at this point. We haven't heard much more about the game since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">its announcement during last year's Pokemon Presents show</a>, so hopefully, we'll get more info about it next week.</p>




<p>The timing of next week's Pokemon Presents might be slightly inconvenient for Nintendo given that the recently-revealed Switch 2 is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">due to get its own Direct showcase in April</a>.</p>

<p>If Nintendo reveals any&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games coming to Switch 2, it might be jumping the gun on the console's launch lineup announcement (which will presumably come in April), but only covering games coming to the original Switch feels a touch odd in the shadow of the new console as well.</p>

<p>In any case, the next Pokemon Presents is due to air on February 27th at 6am Pacific. You can watch it over on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel.</p>

For example, cloud gaming is a natural thing for us to invest in because that will just expand the TAM [Total Addressable Market] and expand the ability for people to play games everywhere," he said.</p><p>Nadella went on to say that Microsoft's new investments into gaming-focused AI with its Muse technology can be helpful to allow Microsoft's game team to make games faster and more efficiently.</p><p>"As the biggest, world's largest publisher, this will be helpful. But at the same time, we've got to produce great-quality games. I mean, you can't be a gaming publisher without, sort of, first and foremost being focused on that," he said.</p><p>Microsoft's new Muse technology is what the company claims is the world's first "world and human action model" that is trained right now on Ninja Theory's abandoned game Bleeding Edge. Ninja Theory has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-new-ai-found-another-use-for-this-long-abandoned-game/1100-6529582/" data-ref-id="1100-6529582">Muse won't be use to make games</a>, but instead to help empower humans to work faster.</p><p>"I think about gaming data as perhaps, you know, what YouTube is perhaps to Google, gaming data is to Microsoft. And so therefore I'm excited about that," Nadella said.</p><p>AI is a controversial technology within the gaming space and across numerous other businesses. A recent GDC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">study</a> found that the majority of game studios worldwide use generative AI already, despite concerns about the technology. Microsoft itself has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">gone on record saying advancements to AI will lead to job losses</a> in the short term but may lead to more opportunities in the long term. Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 people in the past year in gaming roles, though whether or not the reduction had anything to do with AI is unknown. Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>
