		<p>The Xenoblade franchise has weaved an unusual path through Nintendo’s recent history, each new entry in the series being both separate and at once part of the greater whole. While Switch fans have been treated to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Definitive version of the original game</a>, two <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">stellar</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/26/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review/">sequels</a>, and even <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/21/xenoblade-chronicles-2-torna-the-golden-country-review/">a whole game’s worth of DLC</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> has remained an oddity that, until now, remained cast out on the commercially unsuccessful Wii U.</p>
<p>However, the entire Xenoblade franchise will now be available in one place, with Xenoblade Chronicles X arriving as a swan song to the Nintendo Switch. That’s nice, because it’s one of the greatest RPG stories of our time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — The Year is 2054 — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ah9JgFGdqWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X is, in itself, an atypical example of the franchise. While the rest of the series feel like a merging of fantasy and sci-fi, Chronicles X leans far more heavily on science fiction, creating a universe-spanning adventure that sees humanity stranded on an alien planet.</p>
<p>Earth was caught up in a battle between two titanic extraterrestrial foes, forcing the survivors to escape on giant colony ships, with alien foes destroying many of humanity’s last hopes. Your ship, the White Whale, made an initial escape, but was soon brought down to an alien world filled with danger. At the opening, you’re busted out of your escape pod by soldier Elma, and you make your way to the city while learning the ropes of the game’s combat and basic systems.</p>

<p>Anyone that’s played the original Xenoblade Chronicles will recognise the action palette running across the bottom of the screen. You can set up to eight different arts here for your character to utilise, many of which will have different effects and interplay between one another, helping you to cause massive damage if they’re used in the right order. It’s an MMO-influenced system that I’ve loved since the original game, and it still works fantastically here.</p>

<p>Set in our future, Xenoblade Chronicles X feels more grounded and realistic than the other Xenoblade titles. The lost colony and the city of New Los Angeles within it, showcase a community trying to hang onto the trappings of their home, despite having crash-landed in the midst of a hostile and utterly alien world.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition has taken a sensible approach to remastering, and right from the the outset, the performance is much better than it was on the Wii U. It’s not gone crazy with improvements to the visuals or changes to make the art direction more cohesive, though this is the sharpest and clearest the game has ever looked. The scale and design of the world remain the key highlights, and though the contrast between realism and fiction might surprise people who’ve only ever played the central trilogy, it’s nonetheless an attractive and engaging experience.</p>
<p>There’s a further contrast in the different musical styles that the soundtrack hops between, one moment rock, the next hip hop, before settling into the swells of a vocal orchestra. I’ve always loved the weird, almost irrational approach to audio in Xenoblade Chronicles X, and it has continued to delight, even if, at times, it feels as though it might have been slightly more of-the-moment than I realised.</p>

<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X does make you wait for one of its best, and most integral features, the giant mech suits known as Skells. These huge units open the world up, being able to transform between their central robotic form and a super-fast wheeled vehicle, while giving you the firepower to get past Mira’s most powerful foes. It’s a treat you have to earn though, and you’ll be chomping at the bit to get your hands on one.</p>
<p>Thanks to its launch on the Wii U, and its change in outlook and direction from the original game, Xenoblade Chronicles X has always been the series’ outlier. However, it’s one of the most exciting and untamed RPG worlds, has a great story to tell, and fully deserves for its charms to be discovered by more players. Thankfully, that time is nearly here.</p>

			<p>Infold Games has confirmed that its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">cozy open-world adventure gacha game</a>, Infinity Nikki, will be making its way to Steam. This is an ongoing effort from the developers to help make the game more accessible to a wider audience, as well as continue its efforts to engage with its community. For those who are excited about Infinity Nikki, the game is already available to wishlist on Steam. At the moment, there isn't a set release date for when the title will be playable via Steam, but it will be coming in the future.</p>
<p>Since the game was initially released on December 5, 2024, Infinity Nikki has taken the gaming world by storm. Players worldwide have been gathering in Mirawish to unlock new outfits and complete the story. So far, there have been over 20 million downloads worldwide. With the release of the game on Steam, that number will surely grow, with more players being able to access Infinity Nikki for the first time. The Steam version will also include seamless integration with the Infold account system, which will allow players to access their accounts and continue their progress across all available platforms.</p>
<p>Once the game is released on Steam, players will have access to the full range of features, which includes achievements, controller support, and social integration. Thus far, there is no mention on the Steam page about whether this game will be playable on Steam Deck, or whether there will be plans to make the game compatible with the Steam Deck at a later date.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Infinity Nikki has been incredibly popular, receiving critical acclaim for the blend of gameplay, merging dress-up gameplay with open-world questing, platforming, and puzzles along the way. Players will get to explore the expansive world of Miraland, where there are beautiful landscapes providing many opportunities for virtual photography, along with some fun and simple combat. Players can also expect to solve puzzles to get Whimstars, get to fuss over adorable pets, and uncover some of Miraland's hidden secrets, such as the paper cranes and ghost trains.</p>
<p>Updates are released frequently for Infinity Nikki, adding new outfits, quests, and banners to pull from for those who engage with the gacha mechanics. The game is entirely free to play, with optional microtransactions that have the potential to provide you with more outfits and customization for Nikki.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Infinity Nikki once it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releases on Steam</a>? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oxenfree-developer-night-school-hit-by-layoffs.1113183/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>developer Night School has been hit by layoffs, although how many staff have been affected by the move is unclear at the moment.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/netflix-has-laid-off-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>, an "undisclosed number of employees" have been laid off at Night School, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-acquires-oxenfree-developer-studio" rel="nofollow">acquired by parent company Netflix</a> back in 2021 as part of a wider expansion into the gaming industry.</p>

<p>While the layoffs apparently won't affect the games Night School is currently working on, Game Developer says that "current and former Night School employees" were "shocked" by the layoffs, which were revealed to the team in January.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oxenfree-2-night-school-layoffs.jpg?itok=lUgP6FZk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oxenfree-2-night-school-layoffs.jpg?itok=8CbhHT5D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Night School is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>games.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these layoffs, Night School <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/night-school-studio_come-make-some-rad-games-with-us-were-hiring-activity-7297698599251910657-OACv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted on LinkedIn just yesterday</a> that it's hiring a lead artist, a game director, and a senior producer, which probably isn't going to be particularly comforting to those who have been let go.</p>

<p>Game Developer says that Netflix declined to comment on the situation, so these layoffs haven't officially been confirmed by Night School's parent company, but a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stephanie-bedford-pmp_opentowork-activity-7297678853500506112-exik" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">couple</a> of ex-Night School <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7290496710072512512/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">employees</a> have posted about the situation on LinkedIn within the past couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Night School isn't the only studio to be targeted by Netflix's apparent desire to slim down its gaming industry presence in recent months. Back in October, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">reportedly shut down star-studded AAA studio "Team Blue"</a>,&nbsp; which counted luminaries like&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>'s Joseph Staten and&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>'s Chacko Sonny among its ranks.</p>

<p>That was shortly before Netflix announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">go all-in on generative AI</a> for its gaming division, appointing a dedicated AI VP in Mike Verdu, who previously worked as Netflix's overall gaming VP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/night-school-layoffs-afterparty.jpg?itok=1viJV-PD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/night-school-layoffs-afterparty.jpg?itok=BM0dRAh8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Night School also developed 2020's supernatural adventure comedy&nbsp;<em>Afterparty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, Netflix has never been particularly transparent when it comes to its gaming metrics, so we don't know exactly why these layoffs are happening.</p>

<p>We can, however, assume that it's probably part of a wider industry trend that has also seen studios like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/liquid-swords-layoffs-just-cause-creator" rel="nofollow">Liquid Swords</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>, and even bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>&nbsp;letting staff go in recent months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-showcase-february-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive has announced that it will hold a new Showcase presentation next week, showing off some of its upcoming games as well as some extra "surprises".</p>

<p>The studio, which has published indie hits like&nbsp;<em>Outer Wilds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, will air its latest Annapurna Interactive Showcase on February 24th at 9am Pacific (that's around 12pm Eastern and about 5pm GMT).</p>

<p>According to a press release, the presentation will include information on upcoming 2025 Annapurna releases. Games getting more info include cozy adventure&nbsp;<em>Wanderstop</em>, cycling game&nbsp;<em>Wheel World</em>, and photography sim&nbsp;<em>Lushfoil</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wheel-world-annapurna-interactive-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fp3sKS3O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wheel-world-annapurna-interactive-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=NSeGa89k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Annapurna will reveal new info about some of its upcoming projects next week.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll also get to learn more about FPS&nbsp;<em>Skin Deep</em>, "procedurally generated audiovisual experience"&nbsp;<em>Faraway</em>, and&nbsp;<em>to a T</em>, the 3D narrative adventure designed by&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>creator Keita Takahashi, as well as creature-collecting roguelite <i>Morsels</i>.</p>

<p>All of this will come alongside "a few more surprises", as Annapurna says, so if you're a fan of offbeat indie games, you're not going to want to miss this one. The showcase is set to air on Annapurna's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AnnapurnaInteractive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> and will last around 30 minutes.</p>

<p>This will be Annapurna's first major showcase since a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">mass staff exodus at the studio</a> back in September, which took place after negotiations with the main Annapurna company to spin the interactive division off into its own entity broke down.</p>

<p>Following that, a report emerged in January this year which claimed that ex-Annapurna staff had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips" rel="nofollow">banded together to form their own company</a>, and that their first purchase was the former Take-Two indie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">publishing outfit Private Division</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna_0.jpg?itok=n4O3g3po 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna_0.jpg?itok=RCpDatSK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-Annapurna Interactive staff have reportedly banded together to purchase&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>publisher Private Division.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in the world of Annapurna,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy revealed earlier this year that it was teaming up with Annapurna in order to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">pursue TV and movie projects</a> based on some of its properties.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the new Annapurna Interactive Showcase when it airs on February 24th at 9am Pacific. Stay tuned for more.</p>

About 72 GB on PC. </p><h2 id="h2242037"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support 60FPS on Xbox? </strong></h2><p>Yes! <em>Avowed</em> includes a performance mode that lets you play the game at 60FPS. However, this is only available on Xbox Series X and not the smaller, cheaper S console. The game also has a 30FPS mode and a 40FPS option that works with 120hz TVs. </p><h2 id="h2242038"><a id=""></a><strong>How long is <em>Avowed?</em></strong></h2><p><em>Avowed </em>will take most players about 30 to 40 hours. I was able to complete most side quests and finish all of the main quests in about 36 hours, though I was rushing to reach the end as I got closer to the finale. </p><p>If you take your time, explore each map completely, and do everything, you can easily spend over 50 hours in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2242039"><a id=""></a><strong>Can you keep playing after you finish the last quest?</strong></h2><p>No! Once you reach the final big questline of the game, you are warned that there is no going back from that point. So if you want to do everything, you’ll need to save before starting the last quest and load that up later to go back and explore the world fully. Or you can just avoid the final quest while you do other things. </p><h2 id="h2242040"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Avowed </em>an open-world game? </strong></h2><p>Yes, but it’s broken up into separate maps that you can explore freely as you progress through the game. </p><h2 id="h2242041"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it have co-op?</strong></h2><p>No. There is no multiplayer in <em>Avowed</em>. </p><h2 id="h2242042"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I switch from first-person to third-person?</strong></h2><p>Yup! It’s in the settings. </p><figure id="" data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-recommend-id="image://957254442debe30537079d85b5fda23e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2242043"><a id=""></a><strong>Is Garrus from <em>Mass Effect</em> in Avowed? </strong></h2><p>No, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-kai-mass-effect-garrus-voice-brandon-keener-1851765192">but his voice actor, Brandon Keener, is</a></span>, and as a result Kai is the best character in the game. </p><h2 id="h2242044"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to play<em> Pillars of Eternity</em> first?</strong></h2><p>Nope.

<p>It’s been a rough couple of years for PlayStation and its live-service game slate, with around 75% of the projects being cancelled for one reason or another. </p>



<p>One such game was The Last of Us Online, or better known to the community as Factions. The game was publicly cancelled in 2023, with Naughty Dog saying it would be shifting its focus to single-player games instead. On paper at least, The Last of Us Online could have argubly been one of PlayStation’s live-service cash cows and according to Shuhei Yoshida, the game played great.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sacred Symbols+</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pushsquare</a>), Yoshida said “the idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it, nut Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, ‘Oops, we can’t do that! If we do it, we can’t make&nbsp;Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.’ So that was a lack of foresight.”</p>



<p>Yoshida went on to explain that from his experience at least, no development team at PlayStation has been forced to develop a live-service game and that the games are pitched by the studios based on the direction they believe the industry is going. </p>



<p>“From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported,” he explained. “It’s not like [current PS Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it’s likely mutual,” he said.</p>



<p>As for PlayStation’s current slate of live-service games, that has been cut drastically in the past couple of years. Bungie’s Marathon, Haven Studio’s Fairgame$, and a Horizon live-service game are still in development, but as of the time of writing, no firm release dates have been set.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-go-developer-niantic-reportedly-to-sell-gaming-business-to-saudi-firm.1113132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-niantic-saudi-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Niantic, the developer behind hit games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, is in talks to sell its gaming business to a company backed by the Saudi Public Investment Fund.</p>

<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>&nbsp;(which, as ever, cites the old "several people familiar with the discussions" chestnut), a deal between Niantic and the PIF-backed Scopely Inc "could be announced in coming weeks".</p>

<p>Bloomberg reporters Michelle Davis and Cecilia D'Anastasio say that the deal could be worth "about $3.5 billion", and that the agreement between Niantic and Scopely would include&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>&nbsp;as well as other games developed by the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=Qlce0fml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/niantic-saudi-deal-rumor-monster-hunter-now.jpg?itok=YtxcAIbm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Niantic is responsible not only for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, but also for games like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Now</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Davis and D'Anastasio also emphasize that "there's no assurance an agreement will be reached", so it's entirely possible Niantic will remain independent.</p>

<p>If the deal does go through, Niantic will become one of many video game pies in which the Saudi PIF has its fingers. Others include Nintendo, of which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">the PIF is now the largest external shareholder</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabia-pif-adds-stakes-in-capcom-nexon" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a>&nbsp;and <em>King of Fighters&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow">SNK</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, rumors are currently swirling that new&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is on the way courtesy of Saudi PIF funding sent Ubisoft's way, although Ubisoft itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft" rel="nofollow">declined to comment on these rumors</a> back in late January.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, while&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>remains a major hit for Niantic, the company's other games have had some trouble replicating that success. Niantic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-go-creator-niantic-cancels-4-projects-lays-off-staff" rel="nofollow">canceled four in-development projects</a> and laid off a number of staff back in 2022.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-go-dhelmise-niantic-saudi-sale-rumor.jpg?itok=9F6uqmW7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-go-dhelmise-niantic-saudi-sale-rumor.jpg?itok=U68qNVjW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Go&nbsp;</em>remains a big hit for Niantic.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not operations will change if the deal goes through remains to be seen, but it's likely that, at least at first, Niantic will continue to operate just as it always has.</p>

<p>Of course, we'll have to wait and see what happens; the deal is far from confirmed, after all. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Niantic-related.</p>

Based on previous collaborations, these bundles are expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99, each. So, if you want all four turtles you face the prospect of handing over $80’s worth of COD Points.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-027-1739968994419.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Leonardo Tracer Pack is expected to cost 2,400 COD Points, or $19.99. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. As it did with the controversial Squid Game crossover, Activision has created a premium event pass for the Turtles crossover, which costs 1,100 COD Points / $10. This includes a number of eye-catching cosmetics, chief among them Splinter. Again, there is no other way of getting Splinter than paying the $10 for the premium track of the event pass. The free track includes two Foot Clan soldier skins, among other cosmetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As many have pointed out, the Turtles crossover is heavy on the cosmetics but does not feature gameplay affecting items. No-one has to buy any or all of it to compete in Black Ops 6 multiplayer. And there are many within the community saying it's easy to ignore Call of Duty crossovers like the Turtles one and leave those willing to spend more to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that hasn’t stopped some players within the community from criticizing Activision once again for the high cost of these cosmetics, and are saying this second ever Call of Duty premium event pass suggests Black Ops 6 is now being monetized as if it were a free-to-play game like Fortnite.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/19/bo6-s02-reloaded-announcement-025-1739969056586.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Turtles event pass is just the second ever in Call of Duty. Image credit: Activision Publishing. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision casually glossing over the fact that they want you to pay $80+ if you want the 4 Turtles, plus another $10+ if you want the TMNT event pass rewards,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1isjv5b/activision_casually_glossing_over_the_fact_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor II_JangoFett_II said</a>. “Call of Duty's Gross greed strikes again... DESPICABLE!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Guess we can expect an event pass sold every season now,” Hipapitapotamus suggested. “Remember when events were good and got you cool universal camos for free.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Turtles don’t use guns," APensiveMonkey declared. "Their fingers wouldn’t even... I hate this..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth going into more detail on how Activision monetizes Black Ops 6. Each season brings with it a new battle pass, the base version of which costs 1,100 COD Points / $9.99. There’s an extra premium version of the battle pass, called BlackCell, which costs $29.99 (you can’t buy this one with COD Points). Then there is a constant stream of cosmetics available to buy from the store. The Turtles crossover, with its premium event pass, is on top of all this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So they expect the playerbase to buy the game itself, buy the battle pass/black cell and now this? Na that's too much,” PunisherR35 added. “If this is gonna be the norm moving forward, CoD needs to move to a FTP model (campaign, MP).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6s-squid-game-season-2-crossover-and-call-of-dutys-controversial-relationship-with-microtransactions">Activision’s aggressive monetization of Call of Duty is nothing new</a>. It’s just that the new premium event pass, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-squid-game-crossover-event-locks-its-best-rewards-behind-a-new-premium-battle-pass">which made its debut with Black Ops 6’s Squid Game crossover</a>, has pushed some fans over the edge. And as has been pointed out many times before, the standardized monetization across the $70 Black Ops 6 and the free-to-play battle royale Warzone does Black Ops 6 no favors. What might be acceptable for Warzone given it’s free-to-play isn’t necessarily acceptable for Black Ops 6, given it costs $70 just to be able to play Multiplayer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where the calls for Black Ops 6 Multiplayer to go free-to-play come from. With each new microtransaction Call of Duty Multiplayer feels more and more like Fortnite, Apex Legends, Marvel Rivals, and of course Warzone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision and parent company Microsoft will of course stick to its guns, given Call of Duty’s incredible popularity. Black Ops 6 was the biggest Call of Duty launch ever, and set a new single day Game Pass subscription record. Sales on PlayStation and Steam jumped 60% compared to 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Clearly, Call of Duty is doing the business for Activision and new owner Microsoft, which the financial officers will no doubt be delighted with given the Xbox maker paid an eye-watering $69 billion for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

And so perhaps it comes as no surprise to see the community go into release date speculation mode with only an official create a character competition to go on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/2KceBLysMenA9JY9LsnSL3/bid-on-a-chance-to-create-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethesda announced its next Make-A-Wish project</a>: you can bid on a chance to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For the last several years, we have been lucky enough to work with Make-A-Wish to grant wishes, support some of their local events, and provide items and experiences, all to benefit children who are fighting life-threatening illnesses,” Bethesda said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This year, for their <a href="https://my.onecause.com/event/organizations/sf-0018000000bK8c8AAC/events/vevt:fd137384-5aab-481b-bcc9-95db4365f38b/auctions/silent-auction" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Auction</a> we are giving one winner the opportunity to work with Bethesda Game Studios to create a character to appear as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6. All of the money made from the auction goes directly to Make-A-Wish.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a wonderful cause and a great initiative from Bethesda, but for The Elder Scrolls 6 fans it could mean a whole lot more. And that’s because the community is comparing this Make-A-Wish project to the one Bethesda ran for Starfield, and have determined the point in development The Elder Scrolls 6 may be in currently, and thus its potential release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know, the community has gone off the deep end here. But let’s run with it… for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The appropriately named redditor ‘FartingSlowly’ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TESVI/comments/1is8evx/the_chance_to_design_a_starfield_character_post/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a> that Bethesda’s equivalent 'chance to make a Starfield character' post was published two-and-a-half years before Starfield came out in September 2023. Ergo, The Elder Scrolls 6’s release date is set for September 2027. More specifically, September 27, 2027.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is not a good indicator or metric for release by any standards,” FartingSlowly admitted. “Do not take this too seriously. But. It is finally something. It isn't just a piece of junk speculation based on nothing, it's based on something from Bethesda themselves. Yeah, it's not something to actually care about but it is a refreshing change in the world of speculation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, many within the community have cast similar doubt on the release date suggested by FartingSlowly. Some have pointed out that Starfield’s Make-A-Wish competition was announced when the game was due out November 11, 2022. Does that mean Bethesda is looking at releasing The Elder Scrolls 6 in November 2026?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a long, long time since Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6. In January, The Elder Scrolls 6’s June 10, 2018 announcement <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced">became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a>, and "early builds" were available in March 2024.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> maker Valve has handed over the game's full client and server code to fans, encouraging them to "change, extend or rewrite" TF2 in any non-commercial way possible.
</p>
<p>
The code is now available via a "massive" update to the Source SDK [Software Development Kit], <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=238809">Valve announced last night</a>, making "anything from small tweaks to complete conversions possible".
</p>
<p>
For content creators, modders and fans, this means completely new TF2 games can be put together - as long as they're released for free.

<p>"TF2 mods may be published on the Steam Store, and after publication will appear as new games in the Steam game list," Valve wrote.</p>
<p>
Other updates to the Source SDK include 64-bit binary support, a scalable HUD/UI and other fixes for all other multiplayer Source engine games, including Counter-Strike: Source, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/day-defeat-source">Day of Defeat: Source</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>: Deathmatch, and Half-Life Deathmatch: Source.
</p>
<p>
"Players have a lot of investment in their TF2 inventories, and Steam Workshop contributors have created of a lot of that content," Valve added. "The majority of items in the game now are thanks to the hard work of the TF2 community. 
</p>
<p>
"To respect that, we're asking TF2 mod makers continue to respect that connection, and to not make mods that have the purpose of trying to profit off Workshop contributors' efforts."
</p>
<p>Valve largely handed the reigns to TF2 over to fans some time ago, as it focuses on Steam and its Steam Deck hardware. The company is still developing games, however - and there have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">multiple reports over the past year</a> that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">fresh Half-Life entry looks to be on the way</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-and-dishonored-art-lead-viktor-antonov-dies-aged-just-52">tributes poured in for Half-Life 2 art director and Dishonored designer Viktor Antonov</a>, who sadly died aged 52.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Having the most powerful console is a message that no longer works in the current console market, according to the creator of Xbox, as it was a story that only worked in the past for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/xbox-creator-seamus-blackley-narrative-around-being-more-powerful-not-helpful-today/?callback=in&amp;code=MZY2ZJDMZDUTOWJKMY0ZYMRHLWE4YZUTZDU1ZWE2ZMQ5YMMZ&amp;state=f568e241a61f4d22b9243c504e3ba67e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VideoGamer,</a> the creator of the original Microsoft console Seamus Blackley commented on how having the most powerful console back in the original Xbox and PlayStation 2 generation was important, but not so much nowadays, as in that console generation, we were still in the <em>"nascent stages of graphics,"</em> and taking a hit in the cost of goods of the cogs was critical to position the system against the Japanese consoles, one-up them in this regard, and bet on the games being better.</p>
<p>Despite the narrative that having the most powerful console may have helped, the reason to buy any console has always been about the content, and the Xbox creator thinks this hasn't changed at all. What has changed is that this battle for the content has moved away from any sort of technical achievement and is now centered on creating a sort of experience that gets people to want it, regardless of what sorts of visuals it can push. The Nintendo Switch is the prime example of this, as with its content, Nintendo managed to get people to purchase a console released in 2017 powered by underclocked 2013 hardware.</p>
<p>The Xbox creator's statements don't come as a surprise to anyone who has been keeping tabs on the gaming industry. With Microsoft pushing its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/">multiplatform strategy</a>, bringing former Xbox exclusives to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, and some developers suggesting <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-will-eventually-abandon-console-exclusives/">Sony may follow suit</a>, the importance of content over hardware is becoming increasingly clear, and with future home consoles unlikely to offer <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-smaller-performance-gains-higher-prices/">massive leaps in visual fidelity without significant price increases that could limit their appeal</a>, making compelling content is set to become more crucial than ever, regardless of the platform.</p>

                <p>Sometimes, NPCs in games are just a way for the developers to communicate with players in the context of the story. Those in-game discussions are usually meant to guide players to their next step, but apparently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> community really wants the companions to shut up about their character getting upgraded gear. Obsidian Entertainment has released a day-one patch for Avowed, and near the top of the community requests was a note that companions will be making a lot fewer comments about players needing better armor or weapons.</p><p>One of the other community-requested changes is that players can no longer sell upgrade materials to merchants because it makes it harder to upgrade their characters without those resources. According to Obsidian, there is a plan to make a long-term solution that would allow players to buy those materials back from the merchants.</p><p>Most of the changes are quality-of-life improvements, including making companions more viable in combat situations by starting them out with increased health and by letting them be revived with 75% of their maximum health instead of the previously set amount of 50%. Only two of the new changes are directly related to crashes, specifically when casting Corrosive Siphon on destructible objects as well as some "rare leaks and crashes" when the game is paused.</p><p>Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>.

The complete Avowed day-one patch notes are below.</p><h2>Community-Requested Fixes</h2><ul><li>Updates to Equipment Tier difference feedback and penalties/bonuses:<br><ul><li>Changed Tier penalty system from a hard tier to tier system and made it dynamic based on players equipment and the tier (and sub-tier) of the enemy. Tier difference rules now only apply when there is a +/- 4 level gap.</li><li>Tier II enemies will now play a small reaction animation when struck by lower-tier weapons, instead of not reacting at all.</li><li>Reduced damage reduction when player weapons are closer in tier to an enemy.</li><li>Significantly decreased how often companions comment about player needing better armor and/or weapons.</li></ul></li><li>Upgrade materials can no longer be sold to merchants to inadvertently make upgrading difficult.

            <p>Wizards of the Coast has unveiled more of its Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy crossover, including the cards set to shake up gameplay and the first ever summonable Saga Creatures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-crossover-first-cards-revealed">reported on the four Commander decks based on Final Fantasies 6, 7, 10, and 14</a>, with lead characters Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola headlining each deck.</p>
<p>Now more cards have been revealed to show mechanics of the game and beautiful artwork.</p>

<p>For instance, the Final Fantasy crossover includes double-faced cards to represent iconic characters, minigames, and story moments. That might reflect, for instance, the journey of Cecil in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-iv">Final Fantasy 4</a> from Dark Knight to Paladin.</p>
<p>That also includes <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy 15</a>'s fishing minigame - yes, you can now go fishing in Magic: The Gathering - which can be flipped to form a cooking campsite, used to add a food token to your deck.</p>

<p>Summons will also be included, combining elements of a Saga and Creature card for the first time, and can be called upon to aid in battle for a few turns - as you'd expect. So far, only Shiva has been revealed.</p>
<p>More new mechanics will be revealed in future.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> is this year's current free-to-play PC game success story, attracting many millions of players over its opening weekend and making regular appearances in the Steam Most Played top 10 ever since. It garnered <a href="http://www.gamelook.com.cn/2025/01/562110">an estimated $136 million</a> in January. So naturally, it's time to start laying people off. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, one of the project's game directors, Thaddeus Sasser, revealed that an undisclosed number of US-based NetEase Games employees had been dismissed, including level designers Gary McGee and Jack Burrows. NetEase have now confirmed the news, calling it a move to "optimize development efficiency" and assuring players that they "are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game". Just not so much the people working on it.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"This is such a weird industry..." Sasser wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7297672154060361729/">a LinkedIn post</a> last night. "My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...and were just laid off! Oh well! Times are tough all over - Let's find these incredible people new jobs, because we all need to eat, right?"</p>
<p>In that post, Sasser named McGee as one of the departing team members. Burrows has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jack-burrows-b7896399_opentowork-yacantwinthemall-activity-7297445172118724608-mTi7?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAANxzosB8Nu3u0E3e0D-T9TYAyXUCoJsByM">announced</a> the loss of his job separately. "Was an enormous pleasure to work my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling," he wrote. "Just couldn't dodge that big boot, I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig."
</p>
<p>The cutbacks appear to be part of worldwide cost-cutting at NetEase, who are headquartered in China. Last November, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> developer Mac Walters. Last month, they also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">broke up with Jar Of Sparks</a>, the studio co-founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo Infinite</a> head of design Jerry Hook. And just this week, we learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">layoffs</a> at Liquid Swords, founded by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> creative director Christofer Sundberg.
</p>
<p>

Some more context: the average cost of living and, by extension, the average salary in the USA and Sweden are dramatically higher than in China. I guess if I were a Chinese publisher looking to make a few spreadsheet cells turn green, I would start by making reductions overseas. Still, going after Marvel Rivals seems absolutely perverse.
</p>
<p>
The obvious difference between the previous NetEase-backed studio funding cuts and the Rivals situation is that the former had yet to release a game, while Rivals appears to be a colossal bread-winner. It's the only recent release in the Steam most played top 10 at the time of writing, sharing a screen with eternal fixtures such as DOTA 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. If a live service project can do this well and still undergo pruning, we might ask, what hope is there for anybody else?
</p>
<p>
In their statement confirming the layoffs (<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1892090498803696046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">passed on by Stephen Totillo of Game File</a>), NetEase say they have "made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals' development team structure for organization reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game". Without sharing exact numbers, they comment that the 'adjustments' apply to "a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals". They will be treating those affected "confidentially and respectfully".
</p>
<p>
The statement then switches the focus to Marvel Rivals itself, while quietly reminding readers that Rivals development is based primarily in China - an interesting show of a publisher managing perceptions of a game that is based on comicbooks and movies from the States, and thus easily read as an American cultural project. 
</p>
<p>
"We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyn Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience," it continues. "We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We're excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live service experience for our worldwide player base."
</p>
<p>
The games industry continues to weather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">a phase of mass reductions</a>, which have been variously attributed to rising interest rates, disappointing returns on new 'n' crappy technologies such as NFTs, and above all, a 'market reset' following over-ambitious expansion during the boom period created by Covid pandemic lockdowns. 
</p>
<p>
Just yesterday, Sony's out-going indie gaming boss Shuhei Yoshida summarised it all as an "overreaction" to Covid. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves," he told <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/">VentureBeat</a>. "Then we had to face reality and make adjustments." Ah, that word 'adjustment' again. It's possible NetEase's desire for efficiency also has something to do with newly precarious trade relations between the US Trump administration and China, which saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-us-just-added-worlds-biggest-games-publisher-tencent-to-their-list-of-chinese-military-companies">world's biggest publisher Tencent being added to a list of Chinese military companies</a>.</p>
<p>The Covid reset argument and other explanations risk being used as distractions from the banal reality that video game publishers are always going to want to cut costs and increase profits, even when times are good. Thankfully, Marvel Rivals is here to clear things up.

<p>According to an industry insider, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster will be released after the Xbox Summer Showcase in June 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, we learned through the pro skateboarder <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyshawn Jones</a> that a new remaster for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater series is in the works and that he is in conversation with Activision again, which is “insanely exciting.” Industry insider eXtas1s has confirmed that the upcoming game is none other than Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster, and it might be released sooner than we think.&nbsp;</p>



<p>eXtas1s posted a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnCqKCNNJFs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iswtxn/extas1s_tony_hawk_34_will_be_shadow_dropped_at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>) in which he confirmed that Jones’s information is accurate and that a THPS 3+4 remaster is in the works. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 Remaster is internally referred to as Project Chicago at Microsoft and will be ready to be released by June 2025. The insider has stated that the THPS 3+4 remaster will be shadow-dropped after the Xbox Summer Showcase presentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, THPS 3+4 Remaster will seemingly arrive as a Day One title for Xbox Game Pass and will also be available separately on Steam and PlayStation 5. eXtas1s couldn’t confirm whether the THPS 3+4 remaster will be released for the Switch 2, but he is pretty confident about his claim on the game’s release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, February Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 titles include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed, Watch Dogs: Legion, F1 24</a>, and more games. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-titles-will-remove-9-games-this-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine games will be removed</a> from the service this month.

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online and said "it was great".</p>
<p>Factions, as the game became known as, was an online multiplayer spin-off from Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic solo drama, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">cancelled by Sony at the end of 2023</a> as the studio didn't want to become a "solely live service games studio".</p>
<p>Destiny developer Bungie was drafted in to assist during development, but raised concerns about the game's "ability to keep players engaged for a long period of time", according to a report at the time.</p>

<p>Yet Yoshida, who recently left PlayStation, was able to play the game before it was cancelled, which he discussed in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great">Push Square</a>) saying he "played the game and it was great".</p>
<p>"The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they really wanted to make it," said Yoshida. "But Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live service games, and Naughty Dog realised, 'Oops, we can't do that! If we do it, we can't make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.' So that was a lack of foresight."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is Naughty Dog's next game</a>, a single-player sci-fi hack 'n' slash revealed at last year's The Game Awards.</p>
<p>Yoshida spoke further on live service games at Sony, stating that no first-party studio had been forced into the genre.</p>
<p>"From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realise] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported," he explained. "It's not like [current PS Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live service games, it's likely mutual."</p>
<p>At one point, Sony had over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">10 live service games in development</a> it planned to launch before March 2026. "That phenomenon of the live service game... that has, in a very large part, fuelled the enormous growth in the gaming industry that we've seen over the last ten years," said (now former) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">Sony exec Jim Ryan back in 2022</a>. "I think that trend towards live services will continue, and if you look for a model in our category of entertainment, which supports sustained engagement over a long period of time, live services games arguably fit that bill better than a subscription service."</p>
<p>Gradually, though, the company has cancelled these live service projects and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-is-retiring-in-march">Ryan has since left the company</a>. Most notably, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">Sony shut down Concord</a> shortly after release. Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">two games at Days Gone developer Bend and remake studio Bluepoint were cancelled</a> following a "recent review".</p>
<p>Yoshida did not comment on these projects beyond: "Yeah, it sucks".</p>
<p>Sony's recent PlayStation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">State of Play</a> was light on first-party announcements, perhaps due to the large number of cancelled projects. The company's other live-service shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests">Fairgame$ has reportedly been delayed to next year</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-playstation-boss-shuhei-yoshida-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-a-job-overseeing-indie-games">Yoshida discussed his 2019 move from president of SIE Worldwide Studios to overseeing Sony's indie developer initiative</a>. "Well, I had no choice," he said. "When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company."</p>
<p>He also addressed current issues in the games industry such as slowed development and layoffs. "I think it's an overreaction to the Covid situation," he said. "Companies invested too much, including ourselves. Then we had to face reality and make adjustments. If you take out the Covid years you'd have smoother growth over the years."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Gears of War E-Day may not be too far from release, judging by how long it has already been in development.</p>
<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/VGTGamingNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VGT Gaming News</a>, the game's Senior Level Designer revealed on LinkedIn that the new entry in the popular series has been in active development for five years and two months already. As such, its release may not be too far off in the future.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Gears of War E-Day was announced last year during Microsoft's usual summer showcase, but very little has been said about the game since its reveal. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-e-day-playstation-release/">job ad</a> discovered shortly after the game's announcement suggests that the game could be headed to PlayStation 5 at some point, which has become less surprising since the ad has been discovered, as it has been highlighted multiple times by Xbox execs, including Phil Spencer, that<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/"> there are no red lines</a> regarding bringing Xbox games to other consoles and any game could be considered for a console multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Gears of War E-Day is currently in development for PC and Xbox Series X|S. A final release date, or the launch on any other platform besides those that have been announced, has yet to be officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Co-op gaming brings us all closer together—for better or for worse. While single-player gaming and online multiplayer continue to thrive, so does co-op. Certain studios and game makers are ensuring the art doesn’t die, and we’re here to recognize this with the best co-op games you need to be playing in 2025—especially if you want something akin to It Takes Two and Split Fiction.</p>



<p>Hazelight Studios inspired this list, and I take great pleasure in declaring this. I grew up playing local co-op games with my friends whenever possible. A Crash Team Racing tournament, a backstage scrap in WWF Smackdown, or an intense 1v1 in Point Blank. Multiplayer gaming has veered off toward online for the most part. But you’ve got the likes of Hazelight Studios developing games intended as a co-op-only title.</p>



<p>The developer is responsible for the Game of the Year-winning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-hazelight-studios-next-game-it-takes-two-sequel-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>. If you need more local co-op fixes, here’s a list of contenders to consider in 2025.</p>

<p>Game director Josef Fares’ first project heading up the newly-formed <a href="https://www.hazelight.se/games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hazelight Studios</a> was A Way Out. Two human players have to choose their character—Vincent or Leo. The action plays out in split-screen fashion across a dramatic story with gameplay fueled by teamwork. It’s not as polished as It Takes Two, but it’s a breath of fresh air, and I’d recommend you try it out.</p>

<p>Yes, 2023’s outstanding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-have-moved-their-full-attention-to-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> can be enjoyed locally with another player. There are no cutbacks or restrictions either as you can create your characters and unravel BG3’s world together like normal. <strong>The RPG is about as refined and revered as they come</strong>, and it has enough content to keep you going until a probable Baldur’s Gate 4.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands">Borderlands</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Take your pick. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve stood by Borderlands since its 2009 debut and will continue to do so. From its first iteration to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, I don’t think it matters much which title you opt to play in co-op. <strong>Borderlands 2 is my favorite</strong> as it captures the soul of Pandora perfectly with its story, characters, and quests. But a stroll through Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands or enjoying a blast from the past with the Pre-Sequel won’t do any harm either in the epic looter shooter saga.</p>



<h3 id="h-brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers A Tale of Two Sons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>True kinship. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Brothers A Tale of Two Sons was Fares’ directorial debut in video games. He worked under the banner of Starbreeze Studios to bring the story of two brothers to life before he founded Hazelight Studios. The game didn’t have co-op at launch, but the remake addressed this overlooked issue. This narrative-heavy adventure is a must, and you can once again see the <strong>groundwork being laid down for It Takes Two and Split Fiction</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-chained-together">Chained Together</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The only way up is down. Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p>I watched internet darlings Kai Cenat and IShowSpeed almost destroy each other playing Chained Together. Its concept is simple: You and a partner are chained together, and you must work together to escape hell. Every step, jump, and action you take affects your cohort. One false move, and you’re sent spiraling back down to the bottom—potentially startling Satan in his slumber.</p>



<h3 id="h-cuphead">Cuphead</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Good day for a swell battle! Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Cuphead is one of my favorite games of the last 10 years. Its presentation is incredibly niche and nuanced and Cuphead is essentially a boss rush—with a handful of platforming levels for good measure. It’s more fun with a partner but also frustrating as the enemy’s health scales accordingly. You can spend a good hour or two beating a boss, but <strong>the feeling of satisfaction is unbridled and unbeatable</strong>. It has a delicious last course through its DLC if you’re not satiated—called The Delicious Last Course!</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-4">Diablo 4</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Everyone’s heard of Diablo. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Blizzard’s multimedia empire includes the iconic Diablo franchise. 2023 saw the release of Diablo 4, and the ARPG title not only offers more looting, dungeon crawling, bosses, and run-ins with demons and angels but also local co-op. You can buddy up with someone next to you, pick a class, and explore the plagued grounds of Sanctuary as you try to carefully tip-toe around the ongoing conflict between the High Heavens and the Burning Hells.</p>



<h3 id="h-don-t-starve-together">Don’t Starve Together</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Friendly. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Whereas something like Cuphead is overtly difficult, Don’t Starve doesn’t give this impression. Don’t let it fool you though as Don’t Starve demands you survive at all costs. You need food, hydration, sleep, warm surroundings, and a means of defending yourself. You don’t need to channel your inner Bear Grylls on your own though as the free Don’t Starve Together update introduces local co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-lara-croft-and-the-guardian-of-light">Lara Croft And The Guardian of Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Niche but needed. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light—and its Temple of Osiris follow-up—feels derided. I question how many people (and even Tomb Raider fans) remember this 2010 gem. Unlike other entries on our best co-op games you need to play in 2025 list, this benefits from an in-person friend helping you out. It has Lara, her trademark pistols, outfit, and classic Tomb Raider exploration—<strong>what more do you want?</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-moving-out">Moving Out</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Frustration aplenty. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Anyone who’s ever <em>literally </em>moved out in real life automatically understands this game. It’s a nuisance in so many ways. So what better way to exemplify the rigors of moving out than by taking this nightmare, cranking up the hyperbole, and inciting chaos in relationships and friendships? Moving Out is a wonderful display of co-op and calamity, and it has a sequel if you want more punishment.</p>



<h3 id="h-overcooked">Overcooked</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It doesn’t start like this, I promise. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Substitute “moving out” with “cooking” and I can be done with this entry. Alas, this wouldn’t be informative of me and lacks integrity. I will say that if I was ranking the games on this list, <strong>Overcooked 1 and 2 would be near the top</strong>. Ghost Town Games created something hilarious, hellacious, and heartwarming with this series. Your ability to coalesce with individuals into a unified force is tested with every meal. Unfortunately, I don’t think there will be any more Overcooked, but there’s a good reason why—more on this later.</p>



<h3 id="h-portal-2">Portal 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A classic. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Remember when Valve used to make award-winning single-player games? No? I wouldn’t blame you as it’s incredibly slim picking nowadays. <strong>2011’s Portal 2 is a compulsory play </strong>for anyone with a penchant for immaculate storytelling, puzzles, physics, and co-op capers. Separate from the main story is an independent and original adventure only intended for two players. The quality is just as good and requires you both to don thinking caps playing this one.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Eye sense danger here. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of highly successful IPs being abandoned, Rayman Legends is an excellent 2D platformer bubbling with life and personality. It has the grace of a galloping gazelle and might be <strong>the best Rayman title ever</strong>. It has a ton of fun-to-find collectibles, one ingenious level design after another (don’t get me started on the music levels), and best of all? Local co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-sackboy-a-big-adventure">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Slowly does it. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>PlayStation and PC owners can sample a piece of this succulent Sackboy snack. It doesn’t do anything revolutionary or push the boundaries of 3D platforming in a way contemporaries and historical releases have, but it’s fun! Youngsters will get a kick out of it, and it’s mindless fun for older folks. You can get stuck into the bubble bursting with local users in co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-stage-fright">Stage Fright</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A lot of promise. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’re back with Overcooked’s Ghost Town Games and its newest IP Stage Fright. I’m jumping the gun on this one as it’s not out yet. But its hilarious debut trailer could already be a sign of things to come. It’s also co-op focused, looks outstandingly creative, and could be one of the most-talked-about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op games in 2025</a> after Split Fiction.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth">The Binding of Isaac Rebirth</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The tears crash around me. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Binding of Isaac Rebirth appeared as a PlayStation Plus Monthly game in November 2014. I barely batted an eyelid. However, one day, I needed something to play and decided to give it a crack. Even though I didn’t know what any items did, why my main weapon was a small child’s tears, or why I was trying to kill Isaac’s mother, I was engrossed forever. The Binding of Isaac kickstarted my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-roguelike-games-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelike/roguelite</a> journey, and if you haven’t, I implore you to do the same as it has added co-op since release.</p>



<h3 id="h-unravel-two">Unravel Two</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Threading the eye of a needle. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>The first Unravel was a blast, but the sequel supersedes it by allowing two players to intertwine. Your relationship with your co-op partner is unlikely to unravel as the title is straightforward and shouldn’t trouble you. But its tamer nature is a more welcome and pleasant one. Once you’re done, you’ll both yarn for more.</p>

            <p>Nike is stepping out with some 'low poly' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a>-inspired trainers.</p>
<p>The trainers are part of Nike's Air Max 1 collection of shoes, and are predominantly a Donkey Kong shade of brown, complete with a red and yellow Swoosh logo. There is also yellow detailing around the base of the shoe.</p>

<p>On the inside, meanwhile, owners will be able to enjoy looking at some DK-inspired coins when the trainers are not on their feet, except rather than having DK on their surface, these coins are embossed with DS, for Dot Swoosh.</p>
<p>Oh, and there is a low poly banana in there -  I mean, this is a Donkey Kong trainer, after all, and what is Donkey Kong without some bananas.</p>
<p>As for when you can get your hands (or, should that be feet?) on these trainers, that hasn't been announced yet, although <a href="https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/">SneakerNews</a> expects them to be released at some point during the spring/summer season. I wonder if they will also come in Diddy sizes...?</p>

            <p>
High-profile indie game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> will lay out its forthcoming release slate during a new digital showcase event, to be broadcast next week.
</p>
<p>
The showcase will be the company's first since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">vast majority of Annapurna's staff quit last September in a mass exodus</a> - reportedly following internal squabbles over the leadership of the company.
</p>
<p>
In the past, Annapurna has been hailed as a beacon for the very best of indie game talent, and has helped publish hits such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/what-remains-of-edith-finch">What Remains of Edith Finch</a>, Outer Wilds, Cocoon and Stray.
</p>
<p>
This new show, to be held at 5pm UK time next Monday, 24th February is designed to offer a look at what's next.

<p>
Annapurna says the event will last 30 minutes, and include looks at Wanderstop, Skin Deep, Wheel World, Faraway, Lushfoil, To a T, Morsels, and "a few more surprises" - all set to launch in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Many of these titles are games Annapurna has been working to publish for some time, such as Wanderstop, the next project from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden.
</p>
<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">Wreden said that "nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon" despite the upheaval within Annapurna</a>, which he described as a "bump in the road".
</p>
<p>
At the time, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">Annapurna spokesperson described the loss of its staff as "a baffler"</a>, and pledged it would plod on.
</p>
<p>
"We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership," the company said. 
</p>
<p>
"If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. PS. We're hiring."
</p>
<p>
Staff members who previously worked at Annapurna have since reportedly reformed as a fresh team. Last month, Bloomberg stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">this group had taken on the games and franchises of Private Division</a>, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold off by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November last year. These include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">new action-adventure from Pokémon developer Game Freak</a>.
