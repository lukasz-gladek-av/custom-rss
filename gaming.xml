            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/ea-sports-fc-25-preview-what-a-rush/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Football fever has been at its peak this summer, as the entertaining league seasons fed into the not quite as exciting Euros and Copa America. As is always the case with an international-filled summer, we’ve only got a short break before the 2024/25 season kicks off, and that means a new EA Sports FC game nears release as well. I had the chance to play some of EA Sports FC 25, which featured the UEFA Champions League Kick Off mode, and the new Rush mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBM2xyco_Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The EA FC 25 closed beta had seven teams to choose from men’s and women’s football across both modes. Those were both the men’s and women’s Real Madrid and Chelsea teams, Manchester City men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, Athletico Madrid men’s team, Liverpool men’s team, and the women’s Olympique Lyonnais team. As you would expect, each has their strengths with Real Madrid and Manchester City having the best stats, though every team has its key players.</p>


<p>To make those players stand out, FC 25 sees the return of playstyles from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a>. These are attributes that enhance specific elements of a player’s skillset, with key players having elite playstyles. For example, Valverde has Rapid+ which gives him a higher sprint speed when dribbling, and reduces the chances of making mistakes when sprinting or performing knock ons. Another player with an elite playstyle is De Bruyne, with his Incisive Pass+, which makes through passes more accurate, gives his swerve passes maximum curve, and precision passes that travel at top speed towards their target.</p>


<p>While the game has been enhanced with a new FC IQ to manage player tactics,&nbsp;EA FC 25’s main on the pitch action feels very similar to its predecessor. Much of the matches condense around the midfield with occasional bursts through the centre and the wings to either get a shot on goal, or fire a cross in. Goals do feel easy to score, with none of my matches played being a 0-0 draw. This was playing the game on Professional difficulty. Getting the ball into the box for and cutting back a pass to another player almost always guarantees a goal. Worldies are harder to pull off, but in one match I managed to replicate Bellingham’s overhead kick that he scored against Slovakia.</p>
<p>For the full game, there’s a few marquee changes built around the core on pitch action. The career mode will let you dive into women’s football for the first time, giving parity to the men’s game across all modes, and there’s also a new Live Start Points feature that will take real world scenarios and put you in control after the mid-season transfer window or managerial changes, for example. Reckon you can survive the fight at the bottom of a league?</p>

<p>The mode that could really ignite the excitement for EA FC 25 is Rush mode, in what is a fresh take on five-a-side football and the Volta mode of recent years, with two teams of five players playing. This can be single player with AI teammates, or with four other players with an AI goalie. Where a proper match can at times feel slow, Rush mode is fast paced and end-to-end, feeling more like a basketball game as teams rapidly go back and forth trying to score.</p>
<p>Now, some of you may remember the blue card controversy from earlier this year. FIFA proposed introducing a blue card that would send players to a sin bin temporarily for certain infractions for a limited time, before being allowed back on the pitch. While that idea was dropped in reality, the blue card is present in Rush mode. If a player gets blue carded, they are sent off leaving their team at a disadvantage, but only for a period of time. There is no way around it, as Rush mode does not have substitutes either.</p>

<p>Rush mode will not just be a standalone playable mode either, with it being confirmed that it will be part of Ultimate Team. Just like standard Ultimate Team, players will be able to build a five player team to compete in FUT Rush. It’s also integrated into Manager Career, giving you control over a team’s Youth Academy development with 5v5 tournaments to take part in.</p>
<p>While the closed beta only gave a small look at what to expect with FC 25, the general impression is a little mixed. The main game feels more of the same from FC 24, with the on the pitch action not being too different. It is Rush mode that really gives some fresh breath of life (more so than the name change) to the series, and I think it will be incredibly popular for all players due to how entertaining and quick it is.</p>

            <p>If DICE's Battlefield series lacks for one feature, it's surely the option to dig trenches. Properly dig them, I mean, not just waft them into existence with a wave of your magic trowel, a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a>. Think Minecraft, but with howitzers instead of Creepers. I have never been to war, but I do own several shovels, and let me tell you, if I ever hear artillery fire or even just dangerously raised voices round these parts, the first thing I will do is tunnel straight down.</p>
<p>Fuck it, I might do that if I read any negative comments on this news piece. Vex me not with your pestilent talk of "map balancing". Watch this trailer for Flying Squirrel's new FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/over-the-top-ww1">Over The Top WW1</a> instead. It abounds with trench-digging, and it looks like you can make some decent-sized craters, too.</p>

<p>Over The Top WW1 is a historical multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> from the peeps behind the fairly well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358710/Battle_Cry_of_Freedom/">Battle Cry Of Freedom</a>. It pits up to 200 people or bots against each other in either prefabricated or customisable combat scenarios, on either "hand-crafted" maps (there are "over 12") or randomly generated terrain. You can also make your own maps in the editor, which seems pretty full-featured, and thrills with the prospect of custom map files a "few megabytes" in size. If I can fit those map files on a floppy disc, this is an automatic Bestest Best.</p>
<p>Also promising: the directional melee combat, which takes inspiration from Mount &amp; Blade, and the dynamic weather effects, which include visibility-lowering fog, ballistics-altering wind, and lightning storms that can bring down trees.</p>
<p>You may enlist as one of four classes: Infantry, who get flamethrowers, light machineguns and bolt-action rifles; Artillery, who dispense death from afar; Specialists, aka, engineers, who get to dig trenches and erect defences such as bunkers; and Tankers, who get to drive such mighty primordial vehicles as the British Mark IV or the "agile yet potent" Renault FT-17.</p>
<p>Convinced? You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/">read more on Steam</a>. Unconvinced? I'll fetch my shovel.</p>

Their games are aimed at kids, their parents, and everyone in between with bright colors, wholesome storytelling, and extremely approachable game design. That said, there are exceptions to this rule, like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ">this creepy 15-second teaser uploaded to the company's YouTube channel last week</a>. A man in a trench coat wearing a paper bag with a smile drawn on it stares into the camera while a distorted music box plays in the background. The only additional context we got was the hashtag #WhoIsEmio, leaving fans scrambling to figure out what exactly this was hinting at.</p>

<p>Today, that mystery has been cleared up. Emio, also known as "The Smiling Man," is the star of a new game in the Famicom Detective Club series, which hasn't had a new entry in 35 years. The game was revealed today alongside <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0">a video featuring series producer&nbsp;Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, who wrote the first two games and went on to direct titles like Super Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission. According to him, they decided to make this new entry during their time developing the Famicom Detective Club remakes back in 2021.</p>

<p>"In&nbsp;Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, a student has been found dead in a chilling fashion, his head covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it," a press release reads. "This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago, as well as Emio (the Smiling Man), a killer of urban legend who is said to grant his victims 'a smile that will last forever.'" Players will assume the role of a private investigator and set out to solve the case and stop the killer for good.</p>

<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will be released for the Nintendo Switch next month, on August 29. Hopefully, the titular killer won't murder too many people before then.</p>

            <p>
The development team behind EA Sports FC 25 - which launches this year on 27th September and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/england-talisman-jude-bellingham-is-ea-sports-fc-25-cover-star">hosts England star Jude Bellingham on its cover</a> - isn't worried about a potential revival of the FIFA brand at another developer. 
</p>
<p>
FIFA itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fifa-insists-the-only-authentic-real-game-that-has-the-fifa-name-will-be-the-best-one-available">has not been shy about wanting to rope in a new company</a> to make a fresh football game with its branding, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-unveils-post-fifa-rebranding">the collapse of its long-running partnership with EA Sports back in 2022</a>.
</p>
<p>
Rumours have persisted that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-will-develop-the-next-fifa-game-leaker-claims">FIFA licence has now been picked up by another developer</a> with plans to launch a fresh FIFA product in time for the next World Cup. Who could it be? Well, 2K, publisher of the NBA 2K, PGA Tour 2K and WWE 2K sports series, has reportedly been in the frame. 
</p>
<p>
So, are EA's FC team worried about a new rival? In short, no, not at all.

<p>
"We welcome competition," EA Sports FC associate producer Sam Rivera told Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell at preview event for FC 25 last week. "We welcome competition and I think that's good. It's good for everyone. We want to see what other what other football games can do. 
</p>
<p>
"But what I can tell you is [that to] create a fun, deep football game takes many years. For us, like literally every year, just on community feedback, we take in thousands of changes, little things here and there. We try so many different things and then we're finally in a position where we know how we can fix these. 
</p>
<p>
"If you compare [EA Sports FC] 24 and [FIFA] 14 - 10 years difference - there's a lot of improvements, a lot of things that you can right away see. The amount of bugs, amount of problems [it had], the game [now] is just a lot more polished. And that takes 10 years to get there. So basically it takes time, iteration, knowing what the community wants. Those things don't happen just by themselves. You need to hear from them. They don't get built by themselves. It's an interesting process we go through every year."
</p>
<p>
Ultimate Team line producer Karthik Venkateshan also discussed the likely impending arrival of a new footballing game rival.
</p>
<p>
"I guess from a dev perspective, we're excited - we're football fans ourselves," Venkateshan said. "We're excited when something pops up, we're always playing other games, seeing different takes. I'm like, 'Oh, they approached it that way'. Like, what do we think about it? 
</p>
<p>
"And it's also - I don't know, healthy? The little bit of American in me thinks its healthy when there's competition? [I'm] energised, more so than like... 'am I worried?' No, not really."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25%E2%80%99s-exciting-new-5v5-experience.929820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rush-is-ea-sports-fc-25-exciting-new-5v5-experience/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following community feedback, the newly announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-25-officially-announced-full-reveal-on-july-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EA Sports FC 25</a> is ditching the arcade-like Volta mode in favor of Rush. This brand new mode pits two teams of five players each against one another in an appropriately sized pitch of 63.7x46.7 meters (down from the standard 105x68 meters). The size went through various iterations to get it right.</p>
<p>The main difference with Volta is that Rush fully retains the gameplay mechanics of the regular 11v11 mode when it comes to depth and balance of defending, attacking, dribbling, shooting, et cetera. Rush is obviously meant to be a social, accessible mode, with four humans (and the AI-controlled goalkeeper) controlling one player on each team. This allows them to have far more time with the ball, and every action on the field matters more due to the reduced team size. Positioning is also completely dynamic, just like in five-a-side football.</p>
<p>While Rush's core mechanics are identical to regular matches, the developers still chose to introduce a few key changes to spice up the experience. For example, the kick-off sees players rushing to the ball, Rocket-League style; this does not apply to resuming the game after the other team has scored, which happens exactly like in real football. The offside line starts on the attacking third rather than the attacking half of a team to accommodate the different pitch and team sizes.</p>
<p>Perhaps more intriguing is the addition of blue cards. This has been discussed quite a while in the real sports, although FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed earlier this year the idea was ultimately scrapped. The concept is essentially borrowed from other sports: instead of a final red card that sends a player off the pitch for good, the blue card is a limited-time ban, as you would see in hockey or water polo. Currently, it lasts for one minute (a standard Rush match lasts eight minutes).</p>
<p>This creates an interesting dynamic where players need to be really careful with the fouls, else they might be crippling their team for a fairly sizable amount of time. With one less player on the pitch, everything is that much more challenging. On the flip side, just like in hockey or water polo, it creates a feeling where the team really needs to focus on holding off their rivals' attempts to score for a set amount of time, and if they do, all will be well. Lastly, the penalty is also changed into a 1v1 battle reminiscent of old US-style shootouts, where the captain of the defending team briefly controls the goalkeeper.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FC25_REV_UT-POS_16x9_HIRES_WM-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Rush is definitely a different 'mode' of playing EA Sports FC 25, it is perhaps not quite accurate to mention it as a separate mode. That's because it's actually integrated into every other mode available in the game: Kick Off, Clubs, Ultimate Team, and Manager Career (in the latter mode, you take control of your Youth Academy development throughout the season with new playable 5v5 tournaments). EA Sports wanted to take advantage of the shared progression system so that players would always feel like they were earning rewards regardless of what they were playing.</p>
<p>Thanks to EA, I was able to access a preview build of EA Sports FC 25 for a few hours to play Rush, and I have to say it was really fun, providing a faster, more accessible experience that, however, retains the core of what players love about the game. I played it as a single player, though, which inevitably felt more limited: the true potential of Rush will be unlocked online, with three friends with which you'll coordinate on who is in charge of taking care of that side of the pitch, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBM2xyco_Kg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is particularly relevant because the tactical options are limited: you can choose players before the match, but there are no substitutions, and you cannot assign AI-powered players to handle a specific Player Role. Rush will inevitably be tweaked a lot ahead of launch and even more so afterward, being a brand new experience, but I believe it has the potential to be a hit.</p>

Although a few can be encountered throughout other areas of the world map or only in certain situations, nearly all of them have a home on Sakurajima itself. Exploring the island is a great way to fill out your Paldex and discover some new unpaid workers—err, I mean <em>friends</em>.</p><h2 id="h395"><a id="alpha"></a>Challenge the new Alpha Pals</h2><p>In that same vein, I recommend taking on the new Alpha Pals introduced. Outside of the dungeons, you have your choice between a level 54 Menasting Terra and a level 55 Knocklem. Aside from being a fun challenge and a great way to farm some rewards, each will be a welcome asset to your max-leveled teams. They’re both powerful Ground-type Pals that can help against Electric-types.</p><h2 id="h396"><a id="saya"></a>Take on Saya, the latest Faction Leader</h2><p>Another challenging reminder of the increased level cap is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/palworld-sakurajima-saya-selyne-faction-boss-1851587019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-sakurajima-saya-selyne-faction-boss-1851587019">new tower boss</a></span>.

Finding one is unfortunately a task on its own because it requires a pretty specific situation. Here are the important factors you need to know:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Selyne will only spawn during the newly added Meteorite Events. <strong> You can only catch them during a Meteorite Event <em>specifically</em>, not the Supply Drop event which is lumped under the same category.</strong> It’s entirely up to chance which event the game decides to give you.</li><li>The event needs to trigger for you in the Sakurajima region. At any other location, you’ll find some Xenovaders or perhaps a Xenogard if you’re lucky. Selyne will only spawn for you if the event occurs on the new island.</li><li>These events run on a timer. <strong>The community estimates that they usually occur once every three hours of playtime.</strong> It’s not dependent on an in-game day’s length, but should trigger around every three real-time hours.</li></ul><p>All of this means you need to be at the right place and time and hope the odds are in your favor. Set a timer once a Meteorite/Supply Drop Event occurs or mentally take note of the time. Once you’re nearing three hours, head to Sakurajima and pray you get a Meteorite. Once the stars align and you do see one, make sure you take care of any Syndicate members or nearby hostile pals. You don’t want to lose your chance to have a Selyne because of some angry NPCs.</p><h2 id="h398"><a id="scrap"></a>Farm high-valued Scrap Piles</h2><p>Scrap Piles, added with the Sakurajima update, are a great source of loot.

Considering how difficult it can be to capture Pals close to the new level cap, finding these will be a big help. All of the added <strong>Lifmunk Effigies can be found in sneaky places throughout the Sakurajima island, so I suggest being extra thorough and checking every giant mushroom and cliffside</strong>.</p><h2 id="h400"><a id="dungeon"></a>Run through Cherry Blossom Cave dungeons</h2><figure id="" data-id="68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-recommend-id="image://68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pocketpair / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-recommend-id="image://68b4391c16990c5e88f7ebe589daafa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character stands before a large staircase heading into a dungeon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every primary biome in <em>Palworld</em> has themed dungeons to go along with it.

There are quite a few spots to plop a couple of extractors down (along with a Large Power Generator) and wait for the oil to start accumulating. I recommend making a base on the island for this essential resource. All of the endgame content, whether it’s the Oil Rig Stronghold or some of the tough challenges I mentioned above, will be more manageable if you’ve crafted the best gear.</p><hr><p>Sakurajima Island isn’t just a beautiful place to explore, it features some excellent additions to <em>Palworld</em>’s gameplay that are well worth your time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an industry filled with bad news regularly, there’s some good news to report. A new game studio called Blue Scarab has been founded by former Helldivers 2, World of Warcraft, and Battlefield developers in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>



<p>“With the backing of NetEase Games we’re empowered to bring our vision to life. We’re grateful for their commitment to creative freedom, supporting expertise, and resources as we set off on this adventure,” Colin Cragg, CEO at Blue Scarab Entertainment, said via media release.</p>



<p>In addition to Cragg as CEO, former Blizzard principal designer Craig Morrison will serve as Studio Director. Lastly, Guillaume Lhoyer and Ashley Nicollete, both formerly of Helldivers 2, join Blue Scarab as Principal Game Designer and Marketing Director, respectively.</p>



<p>As far as their plans, Blue Scarab is developing a story-driven MMORPG in Unreal Engine 5. The game will feature “a unique blend of cozy escapism, true-crime, and horseback riding. that mixes exploration with true-crime.</p>



<p>“Innovation through iteration can be very powerful,” Morrison said. “Our goal is to bring all the expertise that our team has accumulated to forge new experiences for a wider audience than ever before. We want to try to defy genre expectations, while still leveraging all the skills and experience of the team we have assembled.”</p>



<p>Regarding any timeline on Blue Scarab’s in-development game, that wasn’t provided with the studio announcement.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1813589662654476714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, the Dying Light 2 team announced it will extend the Tower Raid Open Beta until August 1, 2024.</p>



<p>The Tower’s beta began on June 27, with plans to run until July 18, 2024. Today, the devs explained they want to “ensure everyone can load up on unique rewards.” They also invited even more feedback from the community to continue improving the raid.</p>



<p>In the Tower Raid Open Beta, players must climb several floors to reach the rooftop, surviving hordes of infected. Then, fans can earn rewards, and new items added to Jai’s inventory will continue to be available after the beta.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good news! 🎉  We're extending the Tower Raid Open Beta until August 1 to ensure everyone can load up on unique rewards.  So storm the Tower with your friends while you can and let us know what you think. Your feedback will help us improve Tower Raid. 🥰 <a href="https://t.co/toPCe4hrdA">pic.twitter.com/toPCe4hrdA</a></p>— Dying Light (@DyingLightGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DyingLightGame/status/1813589662654476714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Some fans are concerned that this lengthy extension implies the development on DLC 2 is troubled. However, the devs may simply need more time to implement fan feedback into the Tower Raid, a mode the Dying Light 2 community requested. </p>



<p>The beta is available on all platforms, and players can try the Tower Raid with solo or co-op gameplay. Fans can access the raid by completing the Lost Armory side quest and using Jai’s Board.</p>



<p>Last March, Tymon Smektala of Techland said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-success-techland-secret-formula/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the “secret formula”</a> to Dying Light 2’s ongoing success is “our unique relation with our community.” Dying Light 2015 also recently got a player count boost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-player-count-soar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reaching over 300%</a> following a major sale. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-onlin3-vintage-cube-tournament-black-lotus-prize-pool<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Magic: The Gathering is about to get one of its most surprising high-stakes tournaments yet, with $65k worth of the most prized and powerful cards up for grabs. Later this year, <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/en/mtgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Magic: The Gathering Online</u></a> developer <a href="https://www.daybreakgames.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Daybreak</u></a> will partner with TCG accessory maker <a href="https://ultimateguard.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ultimate Guard</u></a> to host a competition centered around the iconic Vintage Cube format, culminating in a live “for keeps” draft with booster packs full of exceptionally rare cards, including an actual <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-the-one-ring-a-magic-the-gathering-card-just-sold-for-3-million"><u>Black Lotus</u></a>.</p><p>Called “Magic Online Vintage Cube LIVE: Powered by Ultimate Guard,” the online qualifiers for this tournament will start later this week and run through the lead up to <a href="https://mcvegas.mtgfestivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MagicCon: Las Vegas</u></a> in October, where the top eight competitors will do one final Vintage Cube draft in-person and keep all the cards they pick. MTGO Creative Director <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanspain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ryan Spain</u></a> explains to me that the concept was to make this “dream come true” Cube draft a reality, while Ultimate Guard’s <a href="https://x.com/MartinJuza" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Martin Jůza</u></a>, who is project manager of the event and came up with the idea in the first place (and is also in Magic’s competitive Hall of Fame), says they truly wanted to make “the coolest event we can do for the community.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>If you’re not familiar with the concept of Cube, it’s an alternative way to play Magic where someone puts together a curated list of a few hundred cards to make a custom draft experience of their own design. Unlike a typical draft at your local store, players don’t keep the cards in their deck after the matches are over, as building a cube and tinkering with it over time can be quite an involved process for its creator as they dial in exactly what type of play experience they want it to provide. That could mean enabling specific strategies or playstyles, including your personal favorite cards just for a laugh, or gathering all the most powerful options across the 30-year history of this game. </p><p>In the case of MTGO’s Vintage Cube, which is seen by many as a sort of benchmark list due to both its official status and its easy availability, it means a mix of flashy new cards alongside some of the most infamous ones ever printed. For example, the entirety of the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Nine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Power Nine</u></a> is available to draft if you’re lucky enough to open any of them, and there are plenty more cards that have never been reprinted thanks to Magic’s infamous <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Reserved_List" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reserved List</u></a>. </p><p>That’s what makes the prospect of doing a “for keeps” Vintage Cube draft — where the cards you pick for your deck are yours to take home — so unique and exciting. While the exact card list for this tournament has yet to be revealed, Daybreak has already committed to a few parameters for it, like including the Power Nine, the original dual lands, and all the other cards that have been in every iteration of MTGO’s cube over the years. On top of that, the goal is to make them all truly desirable versions of those cards, rather than cheap reprints or copies that are in terrible condition.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Daybreak has committed to including the Power Nine and all other cards that have been in every iteration of MTGO’s Vintage Cube.</p></div><p>“There’s so many versions of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/leb/211/llanowar-elves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Llanowar Elves</u></a> it would be trivial to find one that excited nobody,” Spain explains, “but it’s an iconic card beloved by many, me included, and it’s going to be much cooler for everybody when that card flips over and it’s a Beta Llanowar Elves instead of something from 2015.” In fact, Spain says any Common or Uncommon rarity cards that were originally printed in Magic’s first set will be versions from Beta at the latest, which will substantially increase both the monetary value and the nostalgic appeal of the entire cube.</p><p>The final list won’t look exactly like MTGO’s typical Vintage Cube lists either, as those frequently tend to experiment with newer cards or strategies – Spain even stated explicitly in <a href="https://www.mtgo.com/news/mtgo-vintagecubemay23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an article last year</u></a> that the MTGO cube was about “curating an engaging play experience, not a card museum.” He says this cube, however, actually <em>is </em>intended to be more of a mix of both. Similarly, Jůza says they are “aiming for pretty much the most old school version of the cube possible, so in a way we’re showcasing the last 30 years of Magic.” </p><p>The result of their dedication to not just doing this, but doing it <em>right</em>, is a cube that will be worth at least $65k in total. While each of the top eight competitors will only be going home with a slice of that pool, the odds are good that their cuts will still be worth a substantial amount. For reference, placing in the top eight of the <a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/2023_World_Championship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Magic World Championship</a> (which had a $1,000,000 prize pool) earned you $20k, which could hypothetically be surpassed by the value of this tournament’s Black Lotus alone depending on the card's printing and condition. Every player will draft 48 cards directly (three 16-card packs each), but not all of the 540-card Cube list will be opened this way, so winning matches with your deck will also earn you a bigger chunk of the leftovers.</p><p>For a community of Cube enthusiasts who are accustomed to handing their cards back after every draft, this event is sure to make a splash. I had the chance to ask Twitch streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/calebdmtg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caleb Durward</a>, the winner of the inaugural <a href="https://cubecon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CubeCon</u></a> tournament back in 2022 and best known for his Vintage Cube content online, for his thoughts on this event ahead of the announcement, and he says “it’s a special thing for sure.”</p><p>“It’s not only a high, prestigious Cube event that you have to win a qualifier for to go and play,” which he says is a rare enough occurrence in the community, “but just the feel of actually drafting with those old cards is not something that everybody gets the chance to do these days.” Durward says even though he’s been privileged enough to draft paper cubes with real Power Nine cards in them before, it’s still exciting to do, and even just seeing others draft with the real cards for the first time can be very cool. </p><p>This tournament also feels like it couldn’t be coming at a better time for the format – while concept of Cube is by no means a new one, it has been going through a bit of a renaissance in recent years. Daybreak has been iterating more aggressively on its cube, Cube-focused community events like CubeCon and many more have been springing up, and some content creators are turning their focus toward it more regularly. Even Magic’s original creator, Richard Garfield, <a href="https://luckypaper.co/podcast/206-the-joy-of-gaming-with-richard-garfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>recently expressed</u></a> his love for the format.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The final list hasn't been set yet, but its total value will be at least $65k. </p></div><p>Durward says there are a lot of factors to this boom, but in part praises how receptive Daybreak has been to feedback since it took over development of MTGO two years ago. Jůza points toward the popularity of fellow Hall of Famer <a href="https://x.com/lsv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luis Scott-Vargas</a>, who started posting daily Cube videos on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LSVargas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel</u></a> about a year ago. Meanwhile, Spain is wary of taking too much credit for anything when Cube is just so much fun on its own, describing it as “Commander for Limited” in how it brings big, exciting plays to the Draft experience. </p><p>To that end, Durward tells me that part of why he enjoys Cube so much is because it’s an “expressionistic” way to play Magic. “Because there are no bad cards in Cube, because all of the cards are designed for that environment and the power level is so high,” he explains, ”you can do different things with the game every single time you play it.” He compares drafting a Cube deck to painting with a brush, letting you follow whatever mood strikes you in a way that’s unique in the scheme of Magic drafting.</p><p>That said, Daybreak Product Manager Tony Mayer says “the curation element can't be understated” in terms of what has helped Cube flourish, at least when it comes to MTGO’s Vintage Cube. It’s typically only available to play during timed windows so that it doesn’t conflict with or distract from Magic’s main set releases – but the downtime has been getting briefer lately. Spain says that’s been influenced partially by the success of <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MTG Arena</a>, Magic’s more recent digital client. It’s a platform that’s far more user friendly, making it appealing for things like drafting the newest sets, but it’s also far less comprehensive in its card pool and offerings, which leaves it unsuitable for something like Vintage Cube.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Look Inside Magic: The Gathering's "Hail, Caesar" Fallout Deck</h3></div></output><p>“Whereas before [Cube] was a filler, it’s now our main event,” says Spain, recognizing that the ecosystem has changed as Magic continues to grow. Mayer follows up by saying “we used to compare it to ‘Is it the McRib or is it the Big Mac?’ And the answer for us right now is something in between.” That philosophical shift has certainly impacted Cube’s growth, and without the newfound enthusiasm Daybreak has put toward the format we likely wouldn’t be seeing a tournament of this scale at all. </p><p>It’s fitting, then, that qualifying for the final event at MagicCon will involve (you guessed it) playing a whole lot of Cube on MTGO. More precise details will be shared in an official blog post later today, but a series of single-elimination qualifiers will take place over the next few months starting with a “Feeder League” that costs six Event Tickets (about $6 USD) or 80 Play Points to enter. Getting three match wins there will qualify you for a 64-person two-draft event later on, and winning <em>that</em> will get you access to one last qualifier draft to find the final eight for Las Vegas. So while anyone with a few spare bucks and the client installed can try their luck, reaching the top eight will essentially mean winning 12 Cube matches in a row across four different drafts leading up to MagicCon. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Whereas before [Cube] was a filler, it’s now our main event.” <em>- Ryan Spain, Daybreak</em></p></div><p>It’s by no means an easy task, but considering the prize on the line compared to the low initial entry price, it’s a remarkably accessible event for those who want to give it a shot. And given the opportunity is likely to attract all kinds of Magic players, I asked Durward and Jůza if they had any tips for folk who might be new to Cube that are hoping to win a Black Lotus of their own.</p><p>Jůza recommended doing some research about the cube ahead of time, watching videos of experienced players drafting, and when in doubt, drafting simple but reliable strategies like mono-red or mono-white aggro over trying to get too fancy. Durward’s advice echoed that last sentiment, though perhaps in a slightly more direct way:</p><p>“Attacking is always good. Just attack, just kill people.”</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor for games.

                <p dir="ltr">A massive mobile RPG set in a galaxy far, far away is heading to a new frontier. After nearly a decade since launching on mobile devices, EA and Capital Games have announced that Star Wars: Galaxy Of Heroes will be coming to PC in early access starting today.</p><p dir="ltr">This PC version of Galaxy Of Heroes will be available through the official EA App, and it will feature enhanced 60fps gameplay with custom button mapping, improved visuals, and more.

Enhancements to progression in this update include a new quest and rewards system, which gives more XP for completing daily quests and more character shards for unlocking new roster members.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: Galaxy Of Heroes first launched in November 2015, and it offers over 300 unique Star Wars characters in a strategy-RPG setting. It features a full story campaign, multiplayer raids against iconic Star Wars enemies and monsters, and PvP battles through the Squad Arena mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The PC version of Star Wars: Galaxy Of Heroes launches today in early access.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Robot Entertainment has announced a new installment in its&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will offer four-player co-op, specialized classes, and improved combat, and it's due to arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC next year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://robotentertainment.com/news-archive/2024/7/17/announcing-orcs-must-die-deathtrap-a-brief-history-of-the-franchise" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post on its website</a>, Robot provides a crash course in the history of&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!</em>, beginning with 2011's inaugural game of the same name, which was swiftly followed by a sequel in 2012.</p>
<p>Following those two games, in 2017, Robot released&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Unchained</em>, an experimental free-to-play PvP entry in the franchise that "didn't last as long as [the studio] hoped". It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robot-entertainment-sunsets-orcs-must-die-unchained-and-hero-academy">shut down in 2019</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-gameplay.jpg?itok=bIUntYJL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-gameplay.jpg?itok=xXd5ovzm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>continues&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! 3</em>'s back-to-basics approach.</figcaption></figure><p>Robot says it recognized the need to return to the franchise's roots after&nbsp;<em>Unchained</em>'s shutdown, resulting in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/orcs-must-die-3"><em>Orcs Must Die! 3</em></a>, the first entry in the series to experiment with roguelite systems and mechanics (albeit with the series' signature orc-murdering gameplay intact).</p>
<p>Amusingly enough,&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! 3&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stadia-connect-819-orcs-must-die-3-announced-as-stadia-exclusive">revealed as a Stadia exclusive</a>, something Robot omits from its series rundown (an understandable omission, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-stadia-shutting-down-in-january">colossal failure Stadia represents</a>).</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>continues in the vein of <i>Orcs Must Die! 3</i>, albeit with revamped visuals, tighter combat, and a number of other changes that help it to stand out from both its series and its competitors, or at least that's what Robot is hoping.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-shooting.jpg?itok=ZCo6Ztzi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-shooting.jpg?itok=uhIbtuff 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to get your hands on<em>&nbsp;Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>New features include four-player co-op, so you don't have to "split up your friend group", as Robot says, as well as new heroes with distinct skills and traps, echoing the approach&nbsp;<em>Unchained&nbsp;</em>took to its playable characters.</p>
<p>A "deep skill tree" and new progression paths for weapons and traps will help you to carve out a unique niche for your hero, and you can also look forward to roguelite-style changes across each run, as well as better visuals and physics.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is aiming to be the definitive&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>experience. We'll get to find out whether it achieves that goal sometime next year, when it lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and Xbox Series X|S.

The constant ads have been pretty annoying, but the latest stunt makes me believe that maybe this whole thing won’t be entirely ass.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,191683" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s because Xbox has revealed that it’s made a “Cheeky Controller” modeled after Deadpool’s rump. The controller, which was revealed via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/17/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-deadpool-design/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/17/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-deadpool-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a></span>, is truly a work of art. Continuing Xbox’s legacy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/03/xbox-sonic-controller/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/03/xbox-sonic-controller/">wild</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-final-fantasy-14-xbox-contest-art-piece-fake-1851339404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-final-fantasy-14-xbox-contest-art-piece-fake-1851339404">brand tie-ins</a></span>, its latest collab features a controller wrapped in a skin that mimics the texture of Deadpool’s suit and even features his leg straps along the handles. Most importantly though, the back side of the controller is wildly cheeked up, which might make for an uncomfortable situation if you ever actually use it to play anything, but makes for a hell of a centerpiece that’ll spark a conversation or two.</p><p>To the chagrin of everybody around the world, Xbox is not selling this controller for wide consumption. Clearly, the company is not populated by ass guys. Instead, the controller is being offered to one lucky person via a global sweepstakes, and the winner will not only get the controller but a full set of custom hardware, including a reskinned Xbox Series X that comes with its own set of foam katanas. Between the ass and the fake swords, this prize seems aimed at deviants.<br></p><p>To enter, you must be 18+ years of age, reside in a country that Xbox supports, follow Xbox on X (formerly known as Twitter), and repost a promotion for the controller. Only then will Papa Xbox deem you worthy of receiving Ryan Reynolds’ yams.<br></p><p>Additionally on July 22, the day the movie is set to make its red carpet premiere, the first 1,000 people to purchase an Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – Core direct from the Microsoft store will get an exclusive stand modeled after the Merc With A Mouth (And Cheeks). The stand features a statue of the antihero making an “oopsie” face that’ll go perfect with the ass controller. For everyone else, fans can tune into the July 22 premiere on Xbox’s Twitch where even more prizes are set to be given away.<br></p><p>While I won’t be tuning into some godforsaken premiere and fighting for morsels in some Twitch chat, I’ve got half a mind to use my barely active Twitter account to try and get this controller. I’m currently in the process of deciding what the vibe of my apartment will be, and as decorations, artwork, and furniture begin to file in, I’m wondering if Deadpool’s ass is something I should subject my guests to. I guess the real question is whether or not I enjoy dealing psychic damage to my loved ones, to which my answer is a resounding yes. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, is the first step in another major overhaul for Hello Games’ space faring adventure. This is a universal refresh that will add new technology, new plant life, new animals, and much more diversity of planet environments and types. Worlds Part I also sees improvements in the visuals and behaviours of water and the sky too. Watch Sean explain in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part I Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmU3_6BK-Ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I has seen the water and cloud rendering overhauled completely. Water is now functioning on a mesh system which allows for more realistic waves and foam generation, while in the sky cloud coverage will vary between planets and be impacted by weather conditions. It will no longer rain if there is not enough cloud cover. The skies will be more varied with the colours of day and night based much more on an individual planet’s atmosphere. There are new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds dotted around the universe. Winds will also be more realistic as will storm effects on plant and animal life.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, can be read below.</p>
<h3>SKY AND CLOUD RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>The atmospheric and volumetric cloud rendering system has been completely rewritten for vastly increased detail and definition.</li>
<li>Planets now exhibit a greater range of cloud coverage: over time; from planet-to-planet; and in response to weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Planets with rain will no longer use the ambient rain effect when cloud coverage is insufficient.</li>
<li>Daytime sky colours are now significantly more varied.</li>
<li>Night-time ambient lighting is no longer always blue, and can vary according to the planet’s natural environment.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness levels now vary as the night progresses.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness now varies from planet-to-planet, with some being significantly darker than others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WATER RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water rendering has been completely overhauled, and now uses a mesh-based system that allows for true wave and foam generation.</li>
<li>Water conditions vary over time in response to both local weather and the depth of the water at any particular location, producing effects from stormy seas and huge ocean swells to tranquil still ponds.</li>
<li>Water now reflects the sun and features ambient planetary reflections for dramatically increased visual quality.</li>
<li>Water colour variety has been significantly increased.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Base parts with glass now accurately render the water conditions outside.</li>
<li>Sealed underwater base parts will no longer “leak” water into the base.</li>
<li>Ships now leave splashes and trails in the water when flying low.</li>
<li>Underwater jetpack effects have been significantly improved.</li>
<li>Swimming effects have been significantly improved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Starships can now be fitted with aquatic landing jets, allowing them to land or be summoned just above the surface of the ocean.</li>
<li>A biological equivalent of this technology has been added for living ships.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GENERAL ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li>
<li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate and saves significant amounts of memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significant memory and performance optimisations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation and procedural mesh generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DLSS3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to</li>
<li>PC players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.</li>
<li>Support for the latest iteration, DLSS3, has been added to No Man’s Sky.</li>
<li>DLSS3 multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality. Learn more on the NVIDIA site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PLANETARY VARIETY</h3>
<ul>
<li>Planetary variety and diversity has been increased all across the universe.</li>
<li>New frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds await discovery and exploration.</li>
<li>Underlying terrain shapes have not been reset and existing planetary bases will not be moved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The chance of a world having ancient bones or salvageable scrap has been increased.</li>
<li>Worlds with salvageable scrap occasionally feature additional rusted remnants to collect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The wind simulation has been reworked to bring planets to life and provide a consistent effect across each world, moving trees and leaves, smoke effects, rain, fog, and snow all in a unified system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fogging and particle systems have been improved for increased fidelity and better performance.</li>
<li>All ambient planetary environment effects have been totally reworked.</li>
<li>Storm effects have been completely overhauled.</li>
<li>Planets can now have a range of additional atmospheric effects that match their ambient weather and hazard conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The visual effects for the jetpack have been overhauled.</li>
<li>The visual effects for storm crystals have been reworked and improved.</li>
<li>Footstep effect colouring has been improved.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused starship contrails to display a low speed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CREATURES</h3>
<ul>

<li>New types of procedurally-generated plant/animal hybrids have been added and may appear on any world.</li>
<li>New types of procedurally-generated synthetic constructs can now be found on selected worlds…</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new type of hostile creature has been added – the Brood Mother.</li>
<li>Some worlds have become infested with the Vile Brood. On such worlds, players can now find juicy grubs. Structurally harming these grubs will summon the Brood</li>
<li>Mother to project their young…</li>
<li>A new multiplayer mission has been added to the Nexus to find and destroy the vile brood.</li>
<li>Players who defeat brood mothers in combat may earn a variety of new titles and insectoid-themed helmet customisation options.</li>

<li>The Vessel of Many Mouths has been given additional ranged attacks, increasing the challenge of their encounter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the acquisition of worm-cult story documents from the titan worm’s vile spawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LIQUIDATORS EXPEDITION</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expedition Fourteen, Liquidators, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li>
<li>This expedition invites players to join the force of the Liquidator Vanguard as they seek to purge the universe of biological horrors old and new, including the infestations of the vile brood…</li>
<li>Rewards include new posters; custom bug-hunting trophies; a unique arthropod-themed jetpack and full set of matching armour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All those who do their part and contribute to the community-wide efforts to exterminate the vile brood will earn pieces of the new Liquidator Heavy Exomech Hybrid, a set of heavy-duty armour for the Minotaur.</li>
<li>Among the enhancements available to the Liquidator Mech is a bespoke flamethrower unit, perfect for heavy damage at close range.</li>
<li>As the community makes progress in the expedition, the Liquidator Mech will become available at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion for those unable to take part.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendos-emio-is-the-first-new-famicom-detective-club-game-in-35-years.929706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-emio-famicom-detective-club<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed what's behind the mysterious&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>trailer that appeared on the studio's official YouTube channel last week, and it's actually a new entry in a long-dormant (well, sort of) franchise.</p>
<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</em>, to give it its full name, is the long-awaited third entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series, which began all the way back in 1988 with&nbsp;<em>The Missing Heir</em>.</p>
<p>The first two games in the series were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-and-mages-working-on-famicom-detective-club-remakes">remade for the Switch in 2021</a>, but&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>represents the first completely new title in the franchise for 35 years, so it's a cause for excitement if you're a fan of detective-themed visual novel adventure games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=UPPoZUQt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=8ckW22B7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Emio&nbsp;</em>is actually a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Emio</em>'s identity as a&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>game was revealed in a new teaser released on the Nintendo YouTube channel earlier today, which sees series producer Yoshio Sakamoto (who's also known as the director of seminal classics like&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>) discussing his latest work.</p>
<p>In the new teaser, Sakamoto says the aforementioned remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>games were what spurred him on to make this newest installment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per the teaser, it's very much Sakamoto's work; he says he worked on everything from the game's visuals through to its script, its cutscenes, and "even all the smaller details".</p>
<p>He also teases the game's plot, which revolves around a creepy-sounding urban legend about girls who meet a sinister figure and agree to exchange their lives for a paper bag with a drawn-on smile. You can check out that trailer, in which Sakamoto speaks very endearingly about the project, right here.</p>

<p><em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on August 29th. You can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order the game right here</a> if you think it's the kind of thing you could lose sleep over. I certainly do.</p>

            <p>
Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.</p>
<p>Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a>, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

<p>
According to monsieur press release, Deathtrap "stays true to the beloved humor, personality, and charm of the series". We can expect "witty orc chatter", "over-the-top physics" and "a strong guitar- and drum-heavy soundtrack".</p>
<p>They're also promising randomised buffs and debuffs for heroes, traps, weapons, stats and levels. Weather and time of day will further influence the odds. As for the roguelike stuff, you can choose to push forward against the hordes, stacking buffs and debuffs, or return to your castle hub to spend some points on persistent progression. The combat has apparently been tightened up, with a perspective and controls that remind me of Plants Vs Zombies: Garden Warfare.</p>
<p>It certainly sounds like an advance upon the first Orcs Must Die!, which Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orcs-must-die-review">described</a> as "about as good-natured a game as I've played this year: a one trick pony that makes the absolute best of what's a very good trick indeed." 
</p>
<p>
Alec was less keen on the second game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-orcs-must-die-2">noting</a> that it "does share its predecessor's sins as well as its successes, which means repetitive and somewhat annoying speech and music, a puddle-deep plot and an expanded but still small pool of enemy types".</p>
<p>As for the third game, I can't find a review on here. All I can find is a blood trail leading to a pit full of stakes. There is a bedraggled, desperate man in the pit who insists that he's Alec Meer, but I will not heed his filthy, Orkish lies, and nor should you. Instead, let's all head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-3f67fb">Epic Games Store</a> to wishlist Deathtrap - it launches in early 2025. Go on, go on, I swear those links don't lead to any spike pits. I'll just be standing over here, next to this lever.

            <p>
Xbox has revealed a new "Cheeky Controller" in a Deadpool design to celebrate the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine Marvel film, with a rather prominent behind.
</p>
<p>
A peachy pair of these controllers will be part of the grand prize in a global sweepstakes, alongside other custom Xbox hardware - <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1813559436818227580">details of how to enter</a> have been shared on social media site X.

</p>
<p>
It's in Deadpool's fetching red colour and seemingly offers a firm grip. Just mind where you put your fingers.

<p>

The winner will also receive a custom Deadpool-inspired Xbox Series X and stand, featuring his katanas Bea and Arthur - made of foam, of course.
</p>
<p>
In addition, a Deadpool-themed controller holder (by EXG Pro) will be available for the first 1000 fans to purchase an Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 on 22nd July, though only in North America and Canada.

</p>
<p>
The news of this controller comes almost a year to the day after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">infamous pizza-scented controller in collaboration with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

</p>
<p>
And Xbox will be keen to move on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-rushes-to-fix-feel-the-burn-controller-promotion-following-studio-closures">"feel the burn" controller campaign</a> from May, shortly after it closed a number of Bethesda studios.

</p>
<p>
What weird ass controller could we see next?

			<p>The next game from the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku will be revealed in over two months.</p>
<p>As reported today by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-ryu-ga-gotoku-game-will-be-revealed-at-tgs-2024/">VGC</a>, the Japanese development studio confirmed it will reveal its next game during this year's Tokyo Game Show, which will be held from September 26th until September 29th at Makuhari Messe in Mihama-ku, Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture. Previously, the studio teased that this game would<a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-surprise/">&nbsp;surprise</a> fans, so it will be very interesting to see what the studio has come up with to make their game so.</p>
<p>In some ways, the latest main entries in the Like a Dragon series surprised fans of the franchise, as they did away with the brawler combat system featured in the vast majority of the series, replacing it with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/">turn-based combat system</a>. The brawler combat system, however, wasn't put to the side entirely, as it was featured in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-judgment-better-call-yagami/"> Judgment</a> series, as well as in the spin-off<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-what-is-dead-may-never-die/"> Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, which brought Kazuma Kiryu back as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC and consoles, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>
