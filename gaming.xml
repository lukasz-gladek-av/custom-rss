            <p>Last week, Bethesda released a remastered edition of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2">Doom II</a> on Steam, with lots of extra episodes and improvements. One of these new features is a built-in browser for mods, and support for many existing mods that previously required a different version of the game. Basically, lots of good fan-made mods are now playable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/">the Steam version</a> of ye olde Doom. That's neat! Ah, but there is some demon excrement on the health pack, so to speak. The mod browser lacks moderation and lets people upload the work of others with their own name pinned as the author. That's prompted one level designer to call it "a massive breach of trust and violation of norms the Doom community has done its best to hold to for those 30 years." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This is a massive breach of trust and a shitty thing for [id Software and Zenimax] to do to a community that created the phenomenon they are now monetising," said game designer Jean-Paul LeBreton in <a href="https://cohost.org/vectorpoem/post/7223926-id-software-zenima">a post on cohost</a>. LeBreton is known for his work on the BioShock series as a level designer, plus his more recent work on Psychonauts 2. But he's also a regular <a href="https://jp.itch.io/">creator of Doom mods</a>. He explains the problem with the recent Doom remaster in that post, but let me break it down.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are two avenues to install and play a mod within the new Doom remasters. Firstly, clicking on "Featured mods" will bring you to a curated list of mods that are officially endorsed and correctly credited. Things like <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/new-add-on-sigil-ii-doom">Sigil 2</a> by Romero Games, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvwvRj1bcQY">Harmony</a> by Thomas van der Velden. The second avenue for finding mods is found by clicking "Browse". And it's here where we find the "giant chum-bucket of random shit people have uploaded", says LeBreton. At the time of writing there are over 700 mods available here, browsable with some very basic filters. An upload button also appears in the menu. The issue is that there seems to be very little moderation going on at all.</p>
<p>"[You] can pretty much just... upload whatever files you feel like with it?" says LeBreton. "And put whatever text you want to go with it? And it goes through an approval process of some sort, but given how quickly stuff has gone up in the past couple hours, there's clearly pretty much zero vetting going on..."</p>
<p>Aside from the possible appearance of copyright-protected stuff, or (knock wood) some "hentai-strewn school shooting simulator WAD from 1999", this opens up the basic problem of people taking credit for another's work. </p>
<p>"I don't particularly care about the copyright concerns of Nintendo or whoever, though," says LeBreton. "What I immediately saw and hated was random shithead's names beneath community works, clearly uploaded without anyone's permission."</p>
<p>There is a "report mod" button, but this simply offloads the responsibility for moderating content onto original creators, says LeBreton, which in some cases is impossible in a modding culture that has been going for three decades, as some popular Doom modders have since died. Others may simply not want to play whack-a-mole to ensure their mod is properly credited.</p>
<p>Some mods in this "chum-bucket" will also be simply broken, LeBreton points out. A popular mod called MyHouse.wad is listed in the browser, for example, and it requires capabilities that the remaster does not include. Sure enough, it crashes when you start playing (something of a shame, considering MyHouse.wad is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/myhousewad-is-an-extraordinary-mod-thats-like-if-doom-was-a-horror-game">extraordinary work of horror</a>). The main gripe remains for this mod too: it has been uploaded not by its original author Steve "Veddge" Nelson but by a user called "MrMysteryMan76", who writes in the description: "This is not my mod. You can find the origional [sic] on the doomseeker website." Some modders are taking to Steam to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2280/discussions/0/4511003584756727240/">ask people not to upload creations</a> without the author's say-so. </p>
<p>If any of LeBreton's own Doom maps and mods become available on the browser, he says that it will be "explicitly" without his permission. I can understand the annoyance. As a Quake mapping dabbler, I'd be miffed if I saw someone uploading my maps for that game with their name as the byline. In my case, they're not revolutionary levels but when you work hard on something, you don't want BilboBorginborf69 to slap his name on your weirdo crypt, even if they've uploaded it out of enthusiasm. </p>
<p>It's not clear how Zenimax will address the issue. The company has a rocky track record with modders. Much of the Bethesda library is open to modding, for instance, and they seem to understand that a lot of good things result from this. At the same time, they have been known to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-sized-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-has-been-delayed-indefinitely-by-bethesdas-incoming-next-gen-update">break things modders have been working on</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-creation-club-launched-not-paid-mods">"paid mods" fiasco</a> some years ago understandably caused mixed emotions among modders. My own feeling is that if your multi-million dollar company is going to use "look at all these mods!" as a marketing point, you could at least do some moderating and ensure those mods creators are credited correctly. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conan-throwbrien">Conan Throwbrien</a> welcomes its host to the stage with discordant jazz and uncanny colour bars glitches. It feels eerie. Desperate. A crushing inevitability. Four joke topics appear at the bottom of the screen. Ridiculous celebrity kids names. Action figures for news anchors. Diet water sales boom. You cautiously slide that last one over to the microphone. Throwbrien emits a string of chirps, like a flame-crested lyre bird with a wounded voicebox trying to mimic human language. “Have you folks heard about this one…”</p>
<p>There is an implied terror in this seemingly friendly opener. What if they <em>have</em> heard this one? What will Throwbrien do then?</p>

<p>More cards appear. Where to take it now? Banter with the audience? Make a pop-culture reference? Self-deprecate? It’s a choice between how many of which type of dice to roll. Throwbrien tells the joke, then the audience react. Whoever scores closest to 13 wins. If the audience win, they’ll simply sit in silence and stare blankly into Thrownbrien’s soul.</p>
<p>The twist is that one of the audience’s dice is hidden. Throwbrien has some idea of how to work the crowd, but try as he might, he’s yet to fully map the inner workings of the human mind. If the audience don’t laugh, the ratings go down. If the ratings go down, tonight’s special guest might not even show up, and Throwbrien might have to replace them with a cheese grater.</p>
<p>“Next they’ll be introducing flavoured air that you can drink, like a breeze out of a can. Who needs solid food when you can just sip on some freshly harvested atmosphere?”</p>
<p>Scattered rimshots attempt to herald a punchline they can’t quite locate. Throwbrien hears stifled laughter and a few meager claps. He lets his lips contort into the ghost of a smile, but he can’t shake the feeling that he’s forgotten what genuine mirth sounds like.</p>
<p>The discordant jazz rings in his ears sharply, but he knows he’ll hear it anyway, even when sitting alone in silence. It imprinted itself a long time a go. It's been part of him since....when? When did this all start? When does it end? When did this bit even start? Is it time to change topic? Have you folks heard about this one?</p>
<p>You can play Conan Throwbrien for free in your browser on Itch.io <a href="https://spelafort.itch.io/conan-throwbrien">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Disney has provided an update on how its partnership with Epic Games to create games and experiences for Fortnite is coming along, and it's still some time off. In a <a href="https://disneyparksblog.com/disney-experiences/fortnite-announcements-pixar-marvel-star-wars/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Disney said Fortnite's all new "games and entertainment universe" themed around Disney is still "a few years away."</p><p>Disney also reiterated what it's hoping to achieve with this partnership, which saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-disney-persistent-universe-tied-to-fortnite-is-in-the-works/1100-6520900/" data-ref-id="1100-6520900">Disney invest a further $1.5 billion into Epic Games</a>.

That game exists as one of multiple distinct games/experiences on Fortnite, alongside titles like Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival, in addition to the original battle royale game.</p><p>While Disney fans have to wait a while longer for the official Disney/Fortnite experience, Disney villains Maleficent, Cruella de Vil, and Captain Hook are coming to Fortnite this fall. From Pixar, members of The Incredibles are coming to Fortnite, also this fall; and the next set of Star Wars characters and items--IG-11, Moff Gideon, and Grogu back bling--are coming this week.</p><p>From the world of Marvel, a new Marvel-themed Fortnite season called Absolute Doom begins on August 16.

		<p>Shadows of Doubt, the sandbox detective game set in a procedural world, will be leaving early access on September 26th. On the same date, Shadows of Doubt will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, publisher Fireshine Games confirmed. To mark the announcement a brand new trailer, which shows some gameplay, has been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadows of Doubt - 1.0 &amp; Release Date Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hz2ovrxAuN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As part of the launch, Shadows Of Doubt will be getting a major content update, but that will not be revealed until closer to the release date. Fireshine Games has also confirmed that the price of the game will be rising on August 23rd, with it increasing from $19.99 to $24.99. Shadows of Doubt’s description says, <em>“Shadows of Doubt is set in an alternate reality in the hyper-industrialized 1980s. Think like a detective and use a variety of gadgets as a private intelligence investigator, gathering evidence and making money by solving cases, finding and selling information and more. Play your own way in a fully simulated world with hundreds of citizens. Discover, meet and tail individual citizens, each with their own name, job, apartment and daily routine, in unique, procedurally-generated cities. Each case has different culprits, clues and experiences for&nbsp; you to test your investigative skills.”</em></p>
<p>While the city is procedurally generated, every single citizen of it has a full routine from where they live, where they work, and their own names. Any one of those citizens could become a person of interest in the cases you will be investigating as a private investigator. You can fully explore the city and every location within it to look for leads and clues. Some locations will be open to enter freely, while others will require breaking in to gain access. As an investigator, players need to speak to people, tail people, watch through CCTV footage, and even look through rubbish to put details together. Once a case has been built, a suspect can be accused of carrying out the crime.</p>

<p>Shadows of Doubt entered early access in April 2023, and since then the development team at ColePowered Games has been releasing regular updates to address gameplay issues and bugs to make the experience run better.</p>

"I can't say anything about [Polaris]," he said. "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game, we just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt.</p><p>"It's not about him this time. We don't know who it's about. I'm excited to find out. I want to know. I have not seen any script yet. I mean, I couldn't tell you if I did. This is the thing, so I could be lying through my teeth. But I'm not. Or am I?"</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/23/untitled-2-1648052443071.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning: The following paragraphs feature spoilers for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</strong></em></p><p>Only a single teaser image has otherwise been revealed for Polaris, but it was enough to fan the fire of fan theories which believed Ciri would be the next mainline Witcher game's protagonist. What's considered the "true" ending of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, thanks to its story being continued in comics considered canon to CD Projekt Red's universe, sees her become a witcher herself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-confirms-teaser-is-a-brand-new-witcher-school">The teaser image also showed a medallion of a lynx</a>, and while this is a brand new witcher school not mentioned previously in the books, games, comics, or wherever else, Ciri wore a School of the Cat medallion in the books and its philosophy matches her nimble fighting style.</p><p>The lynx medallion being a combination of this and her wilder School of the Wolf side (as she was raised by its members Geralt, Vesemir, and so on), could make a lot of sense. In fact, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-of-rivia-doug-cockle-theories-witcher-4-polaris-cd-projekt-red">Cockle himself told IGN in December 2023</a> this was "the best theory" he's heard, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-of-rivia-voice-actor-doug-cockle-the-witcher-4-remake-sirius">this was before he knew about starring in it himself</a>.</p><p>Geralt being featured in Polaris as a side character perhaps lends itself to this theory too, because just as the final quest of The Witcher 3 sees him give Ciri her sword, it would make sense for her to have a mentor character in some areas of the new game. "Maybe Geralt is the new Vesemir," said marktheshark124 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/1eosupo/doug_cockle_geralts_voice_actor_confirms_that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p>At the very least, the confirmation Geralt is in the game somewhat debunks fan theories for a prequel to the original Witcher saga, taking place decades, if not centuries, earlier when the Witcher schools were at the height of prominence. They, and witchers themselves, are dwindling during the events of the original saga.</p><p>It will likely be a while before more information on Polaris emerges, though <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">it is the main project being worked on at CD Projekt Red</a>. The developer hasn't revealed anything else, only that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-will-emphasise-freedom-and-intense-gameplay">it will emphasize freedom and "intense gameplay.</a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-will-emphasise-freedom-and-intense-gameplay">"</a></p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Deadlock - a game which is yet to actually be announced in any official way, shape or form - had a concurrent player peak of over 16,000 this weekend.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the game's peak is sitting at 16,947 players on Steam, with 4,714 people playing it at this very moment in time. </p>
<p>I tried to install it myself via a little tab on SteamDB just now, but was met with the message: "An error occurred while launching this game: Game configuration unavailable." I was then taken back to the Steam app's main page.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is Deadlock? Well, it's Valve's hero shooter. But, like I said, the Half-Life maker still hasn't confirmed that it even exists, let alone that it is in some form of playable state.</p>
<p>Leaked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">details of Deadlock started appearing earlier this year</a> via images posted to social media, along with a report from long term Valve reporter Tyler McVicker. This report claimed that Deadlock was an Overwatch-style third-person hero shooter, with closed testing taking place.</p>
<p>McVicker described the project as having MOBA and tower defence-inspired elements. It's "like Valorant, Overwatch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and Team Fortress 2 had a baby," the reporter said in May.</p>

</figure>
<p>Later that same month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock">gameplay footage from the shooter (which has a sci-fi setting) also leaked</a>. This particular footage showed off Deadlock's training mode, a number of its hero characters, and the existence of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>-style skyrails players will be able to hook onto and ride around on.</p>
<p>More recently, in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-trademarks-deadlock-the-hero-shooter-it-still-wont-confirm-exists">Valve filed to trademark Deadlock</a>, with the intention to cover a number of categories including (but certainly not limited to) providing online video games and video game education.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we will hear something more concrete and official on Deadlock soon. Eurogamer will keep you posted as soon as we know more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/shadps4-bloodborne-in-game/</link>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is continuing to make amazing progress and has recently reached an extremely important milestone.</p>
<p>As reported in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a> on YouTube, the emulator's development team shared two new screenshots on the official Discord which confirm that ShadPS4 is now capable of getting in-game in Bloodborne. More work will obviously be required to actually make the game playable on PC, but still, this is incredible progress, considering the emulator was only capable of booting up the game a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Besides being now capable of getting in-game in Bloodborne, the ShadPS4 emulator can also run Dark Souls Remastered in some capacity, although the game is not in a playable state as it crashes as soon as the character is moved. Again, this bodes very well for Bloodborne, as the PlayStation 4 exclusive is powered by the same engine.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadps4 Emulator Bloodborne Alpha First in-Game Screenshots" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tqMUBBQwrsM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The amazing progress of the ShadPS4 emulator is eventually going to pave the way for a proper Bloodborne remaster, even if Sony never decides to release one. As we reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">last week</a>, a modder is already working on it, giving players what the Japanese company doesn't seem interested in.</p>
<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is probably the most promising of all the emulators currently in development. You can download the latest version, which can run smaller, 2D games as of now, by going <a href="https://shadps4.net/">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Tango Gameworks are back from the dead. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio have been acquired - alongside the IP for future games in the rhythm <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> series - by South Korean company Krafton, who also own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG </a>Studios and Striking Distance, among others. “This strategic move will include the rights to Tango Gameworks’ acclaimed IP, Hi-Fi Rush,” Krafton said in <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-strengthens-global-presence-through-strategic-integration-of-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip">a statement</a> today. I particularly enjoy the hand-rubbing, grinning use of the word ‘strategic’ here. Great news though.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Former parent company Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced that they were shutting down</a> Tango Gameworks back in May, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a> studio Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom makers Alpha Dog Games. In an email to staff, Xbox boss Matt Booty called the move a “consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP." The next day, Booty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-exec-calls-for-smaller-prestige-games-the-day-after-closing-hi-fi-rush-studio-tango-and-turning-down-a-sequel">said that Xbox</a> needed “smaller games that give us prestige and awards" at a town hall meeting.</p>
<p>Anyway. Hi-Fi Rush (a small game that won multiple awards including a BAFTA) went down a treat with both fans and critics, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-fi-rush-review">Hirun Cryer for RPS</a>, who called it a “a fantastic cocktail of rhythm-based head banging and action-packed platforming.” Following Booty’s statement, Tango project manager Kazuaki Egashira posted a <a href="https://x.com/ega1002/status/1788610596713406853">shelf filled with accolades</a>, accompanied by the immortal words “not enough?”. Basically, Hi-Fi Rush was adored, and Microsoft’s choice to shutter Tango felt like one of the uglier decisions in a year full of them.</p>
<p>Whether Krafton themselves being the ones with the necromancy scrolls is a positive or not, we’ll have to wait and see. But learning Tango has a future feels like a great start to the week. Krafton say they’re working with Xbox and Zenimax to “ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi Rush IP and explore future projects,” though say there'll be “no impact on the existing game catalog of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-evil-within-2">The Evil Within 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostwire-tokyo">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>, and the original Hi-Fi Rush game.” Presumably, these other IPs haven’t changed hands.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tango Gameworks has been brought back to life after it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">unceremoniously shut down by Microsoft back in May</a>, alongside Arkane Austin. The revival comes about through publisher Krafton, which has acquired Tango Gameworks and the Hi-Fi Rush IP, paving the way for more games including a possible sequel.</p>
<p>In a statement, Krafton said, <em>“As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;Hi-Fi RUSH&nbsp;IP and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of&nbsp;The Evil Within,&nbsp;The Evil Within 2,&nbsp;Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original&nbsp;Hi-Fi RUSH&nbsp;game, and they will remain available everywhere they are available today.This integration reinforces KRAFTON’s dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content. The addition of Tango Gameworks represents a strategic alignment with KRAFTON’s mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.”</em></p>


<p>Krafton has not acquired the rights to The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo by the looks of things, and these remain under the Microsoft/Bethesda umbrella. In the future, we may see Tango Gameworks commissioned for The Evil Within 3 depending on if a deal could be struck, otherwise it appears Tango Gameworks will be working on Hi-Fi Rush and its own other projects.</p>

            <p>PUBG publisher Krafton has acquired developer Tango Gameworks and the rights to Hi-Fi Rush, marking the company's first "significant investment" in the Japanese video game market.</p>
<p>Tango Gameworks, which is also known for the likes of the Evil Within series, was founded by Shinji Mikami in 2010. In 2012, Bethesda parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resi-evil-creator-mikami-joins-zenimax">ZeniMax Media purchased Tango</a>, before it was then itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buying-zenimax-parent-company-of-bethesda-id-software-and-more-report">acquired by Microsoft</a> years later.</p>
<p>Under Microsoft, Tango surprise launched Hi-Fi Rush in 2023 to wide acclaim, with the rhythm action release becoming a highlight in the Xbox Series X/S catalogue. Our Ed called the Xbox console exclusive both "vibrant and self-assured" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's own Hi-Fi Rush review</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>When Microsoft subsequently announced in May <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">it was closing several Bethesda studios</a> - including Dishonored developer Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games along with Tango Gameworks - shockwaves were felt through the industry. Many were quick to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">condemn this move by Microsoft</a>, with Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba calling it a "fucking gut stab".</p>
<p>However, Tango Gameworks will now live on thanks to today's news that Krafton has acquired both the studio and the Hi-Fi Rush brand.</p>
<p>"As part of this strategic agreement, Krafton intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi Rush IP and explore future projects," a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/fr/KRAFTON-Strengthens-Global-Presence-Through-Strategic-Integration-of-T">press release</a> on today's acquisition reads.</p>
<p>Krafton said it will support the team at Tango Gameworks to "continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans". The publisher noted there will be "no impact on the existing game catalogue of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi Rush game" as part of this acquisition.</p>
<p>"This integration reinforces Krafton's dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content," the release continues. Krafton said the addition of Tango Gameworks is part of the company's "mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment".</p><p>

Celebrating the news on social media platform X, Tango Gameworks creative director <a href="https://x.com/johnjohanas/status/1822804769699946697">John Johanas</a> wrote: "We're back, baby!"

<p>Back in June, Xbox's Matt Booty spoke more on the then-closure of Tango Gameworks, and, while he did not name names, the exec <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matt-booty-implies-tango-gameworks-closure-was-partly-due-to-leadership-change">implied a change in leadership at the Hi-Fi Rush studio was a factor in Microsoft's decision</a>.</p>
<p>"I think the thing to be considered is that for us, it's as much a forward looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game... There are a lot of things that go into success for a game. You know, what leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously," Booty said at the time.</p>
<p>"And we have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves, are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p>
<p>Booty seemed to be referring - at least in part - to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">departure of Shinji Mikami from the studio last year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closure</a> of Tango Gameworks by Microsoft was arguably one of the most disappointing news gamers had to read in 2024. The studio released several successful games, such as the two The Evil Within titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the latter of which won several awards. However, Hi-Fi Rush wasn't as successful as Microsoft had hoped from a commercial standpoint, even after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> on PlayStation 5. Thus, the decision to divest.</p>
<p>Gamers thought it was over for the Tokyo-based developer originally founded by Resident Evil guru Shinji Mikami. Thankfully, that won't be the case: KRAFTON, once known as Bluehole Studio before the runaway success of PUBG, has just announced the acquisition of Tango Gameworks as well as the Hi-Fi Rush IP. The press release issued this morning also mentions that the existing development team will largely be kept in place. Hi-Fi Rush and The Evil Within 2 Director John Johanas already <a href="https://x.com/johnjohanas/status/1822804769699946697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated </a>on Twitter/X.</p>
<p>Here's the excerpt:</p>
<p><em>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the Hi-Fi RUSH IP and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of The Evil Within, The Evil Within 2, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and the original Hi-Fi RUSH game.</em></p>
<p>Sadly for horror fans, it doesn't sound like rights to The Evil Within and/or Ghostwire: Tokyo franchises are included in the deal, whose financial details remain undisclosed at this time. However, that doesn't mean KRAFTON can't reach an agreement with Microsoft later; it would certainly be preferable rather than abandoning these prized IPs to languish for all eternity.</p>

            <p>There are times when I think each week's most intriguing new PC releases are being organised behind the scenes by a fiendishly plotting, Left 4 Dead-style "AI Director". Mostly, the games approach in small groups distributed evenly among the weekdays - a steady assault. But every now and then, they treacherously mass and pounce on one particular day. This week, it's the latter.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 12th August, mockingly empty alleyways and the sound of weeping. On Tuesday 13th August, the wordy wizarding of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/leximan">Leximan</a> (which still has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2017200/Leximan/">Steam demo</a>). On Wednesday 14th August, a distant fell chorus and a lifting of the neck hairs. And then, on Thursday 15th August, the onslaught begins: the early access launch of laidback factory sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez 2</a>, the parsing, pointing and clicking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crimson-diamond">The Crimson Diamond</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/">also has a Steam demo</a>), the bloody fisticuffs and llama-based exploration of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arco">Arco</a> (Steam demo? Yes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2366970/Arco/">Steam demo</a>), the blithe town-building of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gourdlets">Gourdlets</a> (no Steam demo for this one... ah, just messing - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2013730/Gourdlets/">here it is</a>), the madcap musical toys of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oddada">ODDADA</a> (you might want to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627870/ODDADA/">Steam demo</a>?), the avian mischief of Just Crow Things (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537920/Just_Crow_Things/">Steam demo</a>, yes), and the Steam release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2">Sins Of A Solar Empire 2</a> (shockingly demo-less).</p>
<p>Did you think it was over? Best regroup with team-mates, for the Director has held a few zombos in reserve. On Friday 16th August, a concluding foursome of the fun, the fearful and the forlorn: woebegone sheepdog odyssey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farewell-north">Farewell North</a>, pint-sized Zeldalike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castaway">Castaway</a>, cosmic junk salesman <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479840/Pawn_Planet/">Pawn Planet</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2332260/Feed_the_Deep/">Feed The Deep</a>, a Lovecraftian roguelike from the Fruit Ninja dev. As ever, all the week's new releases are sponsored by The Maw, an endlessly ugly embodiment of the universe's yearning for the New. You can follow our efforts to manage and mollify the creature in the news liveblog below. Have a jolly week!</p><div data-live="true">

<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered, which was released in 2016, is experiencing a monumental surge in popularity on Steam. It has skyrocketed into second place on the ‘top sellers’ list, being surpassed only by Counter-Strike 2 and effortlessly walking by Black Ops 6. This is all thanks to the H2M Mod that’s being released this week, which is a Modern Warfare 2 multiplayer revival mod that uses MW Remastered as a foundation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-take-me-back">Take Me Back</h2>



<p>The H2M Mod is ambitious, porting the entirety of Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer platform into Modern Warfare Remastered. This includes every map, mode, weapon, and even some new content such as maps using single-player environments as a basis. It’s a free-to-play mod, but it requires that you own Modern Warfare Remastered on Steam if you want to play it – hence the resurgence.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/GB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Top Sellers list</a>, Modern Warfare Remastered sits in second place – provided you don’t count the Steam Deck as a game. In 2016, MWR hit an all-time high on the platform of just 1,409 users, and it’s widely believed that the release of the H2M Mod will allow the game to exceed that record.</p>



<p>While Activision released a remastered version of the Modern Warfare 2 (2009) campaign several years ago, it stripped the multiplayer offering from the game, leaving players worldwide disappointed. This revival-focused mod brings the game back to life in a glorious form, and the gameplay that has been shown so far looks intensely authentic.</p>



<p>The H2M Mod will be released on August 16.</p>

<p>It’s becoming something of a trend for CDL teams to perform a rebrand. As we head into the 2025 season, only <strong>four </strong>teams retain their ‘original’ branding from when the Call of Duty League was founded in 2020 – every other team has either migrated across the country (or moved to another continent) or been acquired by another organisation and gained a new face entirely.</p>



<p>Most recently, Seattle Surge emerged with a rebrand, with the organisation revealing it’ll be known as Vancouver Surge going forward, aligning more closely with the brand’s parent company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-brand-alignment">Brand Alignment</h2>



<p>Not much has been said by the firm regarding this change, but it’s widely believed that the squad has been rebranded to ‘Vancouver Surge’ to align closely with the Aquilini Group, which is the org’s parent company. This firm, headed by Francesco Aquilini, also owns the Vancouver Canucks, a team competing in the NHL. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, the Aquilini Group owns a range of properties, hotels, and companies across Canada, with a focus on managing an estate across Vancouver.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This means that a second team will call Canada home, with Toronto Ultra having existed since the birth of the CDL. It’s unknown how this change will impact the team beyond an amendment to the branding, but it’s expected that the 2025 CDL season will begin and things will roll on as normal – but it might mean that we get a Major in Vancouver next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-microsoft-krafton-bought-sold<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's <a href="https://aftermath.site/layoffs-are-the-vibe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been such a year/four years in the video game industry, so full of mergers and closures and layoffs</a>, that we've conditioned ourselves to flinch reflexively at any kind of announcement that's made from the business side of things. Imagine our surprise, then, when an email landed in our inboxes tonight with news that seemed...good?</p><p>The email, a press release, said that Krafton (publishers of <em>PUBG</em>) had bought both Tango Gameworks and the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> IP from Microsoft, <a href="https://aftermath.site/hi-fi-rush-review-bomb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saving both from the dustbin of history</a>. Here's the meat of it:</p><blockquote><p>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi RUSH IP</em>&nbsp;and explore future projects. KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans. There will be no impact on the existing game catalog of&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Evil Within 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and the original&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi RUSH</em>&nbsp;game.</p><p>This integration reinforces KRAFTON’s dedication to expanding its global footprint and enhancing its portfolio with innovative and high-quality content. The addition of Tango Gameworks represents a strategic alignment with KRAFTON's mission to push the boundaries of interactive entertainment.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>That's about as good as it gets, right? The studio is saved, and there's even explicit mention made of both <em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em> continuity and work on future projects (Tango also being well-known for <em>Evil Within</em> and <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>).</p><p>Now, none of us know how this will shake out in the longterm, hence the asterisk in the headline. Maybe the next <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> game will be an exploitative mobile release, maybe Tango and Krafton leadership will clash, there's an infinite number of ways this whole thing can go bad.</p><p>But there are also ways it can go <em>well</em>. Like if Krafton looked at Tango's past, looked at <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, looked at how stupid and callous Microsoft has been with its recent closures and figured, huh, we can buy a really cool studio on the cheap and get to own some really cool video games going forward if we just leave these guys alone to do their thing.</p><p>Something Microsoft could have also realised, but then, <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their line must always go up, no matter the cost</a>. Hopefully things go better for Tango now they're owned by quite literally anyone else. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/KRAFTON-Strengthens-Global-Presence-Through-Strategic-Integration-of-T">press release</a> sent out this evening, the publisher highlights Tango Gameworks' achievements through games such as <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and of course, 2023's darling <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.</p>
<p>The latter ended up being a break-out hit for the studio, and Krafton has secured the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> IP as apart of their strategic agreement. As such, the company will be collaborating with Microsoft to ensure a smooth transition and to maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks going forward. They've also expressed a desire to continue to develop the <em>Hi-Fi Rush IP</em> and explore future projects in that universe.</p>
<p>Whilst this marks a new era for Tango Gameworks, Krafton does stress that there will be no impact on their existing game catalogue - <em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>The Evil Within 2</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em>, and the original <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> will remain everywhere they currently are across all platforms.</p>
<p>Krafton also notes that their investment in Tango Gameworks will help them shore up and expand their global footprint and enhance their portfolio with high-quality content with this being their first significant move in the Japanese video game market.</p>

                <p>At long last, Ganondorf is getting the Figma figure treatment.

                <p>A sequel to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice doesn't seem likely, but at least you can make your own follow-up to the brilliant From Software action game with a pair of cute Nendoroid figures. Available to preorder now at Amazon, these two figures of Wolf ($46) and Genichiro Ashina ($52) will begin shipping out May 2025.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZRKJJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Wolf Nendoroid</a> -- $46 | May 14, 2025</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZDPYV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Genichiro Ashina Nendoroid</a> -- $52 | May 14, 2025</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346882" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4346882"></a><figcaption>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Nendoroids</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4346882-sekiro-nendoroids.jpg"></figure><p>The hero of Sekiro, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZRKJJ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wolf has been given a cute makeover</a> for this semi-poseable collectible figure. He still has his signature scar, tattered clothing, and flowing scarf, and you can switch face-plates between a default expression and a more serious glaring one. For the optional parts, you're getting the katana Kusabimaru, a sheath for the weapon, and a "Death" effect sheet.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D93ZDPYV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genichiro's Nendoroid figure</a> is more regal, and comes equipped with flowing robes and ornate armor. He also comes with a katana, bow, and a dynamic display stand, so you can set up a pretty cool diaroma piece if you grab Wolf as well. He looks significantly less imposing as a Nendoroid figure, but if you make these two battle, you'll want to make sure you have Genichiro win the first few dozen battles for authenticity. </p><p>There are quite a few other Nendoroid figures available to preorder now, each one boasting a similar level of screen-accurate design and pocket-sized cuteness.
