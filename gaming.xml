			<p>There’s a point after you’ve tuned the Noble Fokus Apollo’s EQ where you might utter one or two very appreciative rude words because they sound <em>that</em> good. Equipped for hi-res Bluetooth connections as well as some classic wired action, this is an audiophile pair of headphones that flirts with the gaming scene with its removable boom mic. A single headset solution for all your needs? Absolutely, but thanks to the Fokus Apollo’s ultra-premium pricing (£589/$650) you could buy several other headphones for the same price.</p>
<p>The Noble Fokus Apollo arrives in an exceptionally well-built hard case, emblazoned with the Noble logo, just in case you forget who you gave all your money to. Packed inside is the Fokus Apollo itself, a detachable boom mic, a USB-C to USB-A charging cable, and a 3.5mm cable, with a pair of audio adaptors in a felt bag to prevent them from escaping and scratching your beautiful new headset.</p>



<p>The Noble Fokus Apollo certainly look like a premium pair of headphones, though they’re toting a larger profile than other current top-tier consumer headphones like Sony’s XM5s or even Apple’s Pro Max. They’re not quite as large as Corsair’s recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/">Virtuoso Max</a> though, putting them in a position where you can absolutely wear them out and about as easily as when you’re consuming music, movies and games at home. Just be aware that you’re not going to slip the case into a small bag, unless that’s the only thing you’re taking with you.</p>
<p>The headset itself has been crafted from high-quality materials, with brushed metal across the earpieces and into the headband and joints, all ensuring that they will last you a very long time. No matter how hard I tried to twist or pull them into an unhelpful shape, there wasn’t a single creak from the Fokus Apollo, and they simply returned to their original shape every time I tried to be an idiot with them. The curved arm joints are reminiscent of Bowers and Wilkins’ latest offerings, and that shared design language tells you exactly who Noble are aiming at with the Fokus Apollo.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, there’s black textured fabric running around each earpiece and across the top surface of the headband, adding some interesting sensory responses every time you pick the Fokus Apollo up. It’s something I particularly like here, though I wonder how difficult these sections will be to keep clean in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of comfort, the headband has a thick section of relatively firm memory foam, contrasting with the extremely soft and supple leather of the earpads. As you’d hope, the combination of the two ensures that the Noble Fokus are very comfortable indeed, and while they’re not especially light at 337g, they’re lighter than the Airpods Pro Max at 385g, and the comfort options do a great job of dispersing the weight while you’re wearing them.</p>

<p>Fans of physical controls will be pleased to hear that the Fokus Apollo is fully controllable via a series of buttons, with the right earpiece playing host to a central trio of buttons that pull double duty for power, volume, and track controls. There’s also a separate switch for ANC, with the active noise cancellation proving to be a powerful, if slightly other-worldly, application of the technology. I was disappointed to find that there was no ambient sound mode, though the Fokus Apollo don’t have the strongest passive noise cancellation so you can probably still hear anything important with the ANC switched off.</p>
<p>The buttons feel solid, and there’s a raised section on the centre of the three button run to help you navigate them without taking the headset off. However, the plastic used in the buttons does look and feel a little cheap, and they’re the one blemish on what is otherwise a fantastic-looking pair of headphones.</p>
<p>That premium price is reflected in the stunning audio that the Fokus Apollo is capable of. Now, out of the box, I don’t think the Apollo sound as good as the Bose 700 or Sony XM5. The delivery is too subdued, though it showcases how flat the Apollo is capable of being, if you want to experience audio exactly as the producer intended.</p>
<p>However, when you dive into the EQ settings you can make the Fokus Apollo sound absolutely stunning. The handy app – available for iOS and Android – gives you a 10-band EQ to tinker with, as well as a series of presets. It does run a hearing test for different frequencies too, though the resulting audio was never as good as my own custom EQs.</p>

<p>The app also allows you to update the headphone’s firmware, and given that it’s all achieved via Bluetooth, it’s about as straightforward as you could hope. It doesn’t do much else – there’s no customisation of controls for instance – but it does exactly the job you want of it, with no connection issues.</p>
<p>I started, as you probably should here, by listening to a broad selection of music, and the Fokus Apollo dealt with everything in distinctive and detailed fashion. I’m into the heavier end of things, and you can feel the brutal thump of the drums in the new Architects album, though the Apollo’s hybrid Planar Magnetic drivers kept it contained and focused without becoming overwhelming. That’s said, if you want to EQ that in, you can. Noble have opted for a dual driver setup, so you benefit from all the detail and definition of a planar magnetic driver, without losing the thumping bass of a traditional driver.</p>
<p>Whether it was the distorted guitars of Papa Roach’s new single ‘Even if it Kills Me’ or the piano led NAMD from Sleep Token, the audio from the Fokus Apollo is rich, detailed and simply has to be experienced. That’s just the wireless connection too, with the high-res LDAC codec delivering the best wireless connection possible. Shifting things over to wired, the audio steps up another level, and if you’ve got a system capable of delivering the highest quality music, then the Fokus Apollo will complete the final step to your ears in astounding quality. This is an amazing pair of headphones.</p>
<p>It’s clear that Noble are also gunning for the ultra high-endgaming market here, as the included detachable boom mic turns the Apollo into a full gaming headset. The microphone is crisp and clear, and the boom mic’s arm is a flexible metallic build, that stays put once you’ve set it in place. You can always just use the in-built mics for in-the-moment chats, but they’re not as good or precise as the boom mic’s setup.</p>

<p>The Fokus Apollo is a great wired gaming headset, though if you’re playing via Mobile, PC or Nintendo Switch, you can make use of your platform’s Bluetooth connection. There will be an increase in latency, but a lot of people won’t even know that it’s there. I loved spending time with Xenoblade Chronicles X here, with the headset’s wide soundstage ensuring that the eclectic soundtrack envelops you while the voice work and sound effects cut through above them.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of depth to the Apollo’s delivery, and loud explosions and bassier sounds just felt right. It’s a great sounding headset, no matter what content you’re putting through it, and you can customise and save your own EQ settings using the app for literally everything, whether that’s platform or media-dependent.</p>
<p>There are few headsets that can compete with the Noble Fokus Apollo, though the clearest competitor would come from Audeze Maxwell, which shares the same Planar Magnetic technology and comes with a premium price for it. That said, the build quality of the Maxwell isn’t at the same level as the Noble headset, but that’s balanced by being slightly more affordable. In the commercial headphone space, I’d consider the Airpods Max Pro if you’re an Apple user, but if you’re an Android fan, you want the Fokus Apollo and its ability to use the high-resolution LDAC codec.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monaco-2-release-date-brings-sneaky-heists-to-pc-and-consoles-next-month.1136682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monaco-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced the release date for upcoming sneaky heist sim&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>will launch across PC and current-gen consoles on April 10th. It is, as you've probably already surmised, the sequel to the amusingly-named 2013 stealth game&nbsp;<em>Monaco: What's Yours Is Mine</em>.</p>

<p>The sequel trades the original game's top-down 2D art style for a new isometric 3D look, but it's still very much all about finding the perfect route in and out of a series of well-guarded locations to steal valuable loot.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monaco-2-release-date-heist.jpg?itok=Uf2mkBtf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monaco-2-release-date-heist.jpg?itok=FZ8qwHYM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>sneaks onto the scene in April.</figcaption></figure><p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>is focused on co-op multiplayer; you can play by yourself, but you can also team up with up to three friends in either online or local co-op play.</p>

<p>The game will boast eight playable characters, each of whom has their own strengths and weaknesses. You can also switch your character partway through a run if you need to utilize a different skillset.</p>

<p><em>Monaco 2</em>'s levels are procedurally generated, and you'll be able to see each of them before you delve into the heist thanks to the game's Blueprint Mode, which allows you to do what any good thief would do and case the joint before you break in.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>release date announcement trailer right here. It gives a good sense of what you can expect from the game in terms of art style and gameplay.</p>




<p><em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>will be published by Humble Games, which remains an operational outfit despite large-scale layoffs and restructuring efforts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/humble-games-lays-off-over-30-employees-as-it-restructures" rel="nofollow">back in July last year</a>. The game will serve as developer Pocketwatch's fifth effort, as well as its first since the 2017 RTS&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tooth-and-tail-review-fur-and-loathing" rel="nofollow"><em>Tooth and Tail</em></a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monaco 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10th.</p>

If you have the time and patience to get this running successfully, you’ll be able to run the Xbox 360 homebrew store which includes games, apps, emulators, utilities, and even custom dashboards.</p><p>There are some limitations, though. If you want to take advantage of BadUpdate then you’ll also need to manually patch every executable you want to run on your Xbox 360. Modern Vintage Gamer says the exploit isn’t always reliable either, or takes some time to pull off. As this exploits Microsoft’s custom Hypervisor on the Xb0x 360, you’ll also need to run this exploit every single time you boot up the console.</p><p>You’ll just need a USB key, the exploit code, and a trial version of <em>Rock Band Blitz</em> that helps enable the bypass. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK__yGXmds">Modern Vintage Gamer walks through</a> all the steps in his detailed YouTube video, and there’s a brief guide on the <a href="https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate">GitHub repository</a> that houses this software-only exploit.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation has revealed the full suite of esports organisations joining forces with the brand for the 2025 Club Partners circuit. It was pointed out that bringing these organisations together to represent the $20 million ecosystem ‘unites 300 million esports fans’.</p>

<h2 id="h-making-the-world-go-around">Making The World Go Around</h2>

<ul>
<li>100 Thieves</li>

<li>Edward Gaming</li>



<li>Cloud9</li>



<li>EVOS</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>Fnatic</li>



<li>Furia</li>

Team Falcons <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-world-cup-club-championship/">claimed the top spot</a>, but the likes of Liquid, BDS, and Vitality all came in close behind the Saudi organisation.</p>



<p>Is there an esports organisation you’d like to see inducted into the Club Partners Program in the future? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

That's according to posts from the game's official social media account, which point to some kind of announcement on March 27.</p><p>The official Backyard Sports account said, "If you're reading this, Backyard Sports is coming to mobile." A <a href="https://x.com/_BackyardSports/status/1901477257765699772" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow-up post</a> confirmed that Backyard Baseball specifically is coming to mobile. And another post said the upcoming release will have <a href="https://x.com/_BackyardSports/status/1901283589972726247" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"no ads."</a></p><p>In August 2024, Playground Productions announced that the Backyard Sports brand was coming back after many years away. The kid-friendly sports series was popular from 1999 to 2015, and now it's attempting a comeback that began with remasters of Backyard Baseball '97 and Backyard Soccer '98 in 2024.</p><p>The March 27 date for the Backyard Baseball announcement is likely tied to the start of the new MLB season. While the Dodgers and Cubs will play games in Tokyo to officially kick off the season on March 18 and March 19, the MLB's 26 other teams will begin their seasons on the traditional opening day on Thursday, March 27.</p><p>If you're looking for the officially licensed MLB game, Sony's MLB The Show 25 officially releases on March 18, but the more expensive edition is available now in early access. Whereas the previous three games were included with Game Pass, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">MLB The Show 25 is not</a>, nor is it available on last-gen systems.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Longdue, a studio made up in part of former&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers and creative personnel, has launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for its debut project&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>as a "psychogeographic RPG" that casts you as an ex-journalist looking to investigate "a town above, the world below, and the depths of your own psyche". So far, so very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>As with&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll have the chance to play as you see fit; you can "spark chaos as a gonzo journalist" or "twist events as a conspiracist", sure, but if you prefer to do things in a more straightforward way, you can also "reveal brutal truths as a calculated investigator".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=bp8U2d4_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-longdue-hopetown.jpg?itok=cG-UqkJJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is the very&nbsp;<em>Disco Elsyium</em>-esque debut game from Longdue Games.</figcaption></figure><p>True to Longdue's legacy, the studio promises that&nbsp;<em>Hopetown</em>'s "psychogeography system" will replace traditional puzzles and keys with "emotions, memories, and conversations". It sounds rather like if you love&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, you'll want to keep an eye on this as well.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for&nbsp;<em>Hopetown&nbsp;</em>is live now, and at time of writing, it had raised £19,967 of its £25,000 goal (apologies for using UK currency, but I'm a Brit, so it comes with the territory). It's looking fairly likely the game will hit its goal by the end of the day.</p>

<p>Longdue is one of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">a number of studios</a> that formed after original publisher ZA/UM effectively imploded following&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s release. The studio boasts the involvement of ZA/UM co-founder Martin Luiga, who also wrote "seven characters in&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", according to the studio's website.</p>

<p><em>Kentucky Route Zero&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ben Babbitt and&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>composer Pawel Blaszczak have also joined the team, so it's fair to say Longdue is shaping up to be a real supergroup of developers at this stage.</p>




<p>Although many of ZA/UM's principal creatives have left the studio, the company is still soldiering on. Just last week, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">announced&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em></a>, which it describes as a new "genre-defining" RPG.</p>

<p>ZA/UM also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user" rel="nofollow">unveiled a&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile port</a> last week, which studio head Denis Havel says is aimed at "captivating the TikTok user" with shorter blasts of narrative and gameplay.</p>

Night Shyamalan's best characters together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I don’t blame you if you believe all M. Night Shyamalan movies are just 90-minute setups for a twist you never saw coming (and probably didn’t want to see). I wouldn’t blame you because the man has revealed a child’s closest confidant was actually dead the entire time, the old couple watching a young brother and sister are actually escaped mental patients and not their grandparents, and people are rapidly aging because they’re on an island used for a pharmaceutical experiment. Again, I wouldn’t blame you for seeing Shyamalan as a plot twist merchant, but he would.</p><p>“[A common misperception of me is]<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that all my movies have twist endings, or that they’re all scary. All my movies are spiritual and all have an emotional perspective,” Shyamalan said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-5minute-interview-m-night-shyamalan-writer-and-director-837413.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-5minute-interview-m-night-shyamalan-writer-and-director-837413.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2008 interview</a></span> with <em>The Independent.</em></p><p>Regardless of what you or the acclaimed director thinks, his twists are his cinematic fingerprint that’s left a lasting impression on the minds of generations of moviegoers. Before he brings his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/m-night-shyamalan-starts-writing-17th-feature-1236088370/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/m-night-shyamalan-starts-writing-17th-feature-1236088370/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">17th film to theaters</a></span>, let’s reflect on the twists that annoyed us, shocked us, and left us questioning what the hell we watched. </p></div></div><div><p>Shyamalan has spent his career yanking the rug out from under audiences, so you’d expect <em>Knock at the Cabin</em> to have a mind-blowing twist. A vacationing family is taken hostage by four strangers who claim the world will end unless they sacrifice one of their own, leaving everyone guessing whether it’s real or just madness. Maybe the invaders are delusional, maybe the apocalypse is a hoax, maybe Dave Bautista rips off a mask to reveal he’s been Bruce Willis all along. But no, the twist is that there is no worthwhile twist—turns out, the world really is ending, making the whole movie feel like a magician dramatically pausing for two hours before pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p></div><div><p>Shyamalan crafts <em>Signs</em> as a slow-burn thriller about a grieving family confronting eerie crop circles and an impending alien invasion, layering suspense with his signature brand of existential dread. Throughout the film, he meticulously seeds clues—flashbacks to the dying wife of Graham Hess (Mel Gibson), a seemingly random baseball anecdote, and a child’s peculiar water obsession—all hinting that these small, disconnected moments might hold a greater purpose. Then comes the big reveal: the hyper-intelligent aliens, capable of interstellar travel, are inexplicably vulnerable to water, making Earth the worst possible planet to invade. It’s the cinematic equivalent of a chess grandmaster brooding over a game for hours, only to knock over his own king and claim it was all part of the plan.</p></div><div><p>   <em>Lady in the Water</em> is a whimsical bedtime story awkwardly wedged into a supernatural thriller. Following an apartment superintendent who discovers a mysterious woman in his pool and learns she is part of an ancient prophecy, the film layers intrigue by assigning each quirky tenant a mythical role, suggesting that fate has intricately woven them into a grand, predestined purpose. But when the truth is revealed, it turns out their assigned roles were misinterpreted, forcing a last-minute reshuffling of expectations that feels more like a narrative prank than a satisfying twist. It’s as if the film spent its runtime promising an elegant magic trick, only to clumsily drop the deck of cards and insist that was the trick all along. </p></div><div><p>Alright, so <em>The Village</em> is basically a super moody thriller in which this small, old-timey community is living in constant fear of monsters lurking in the woods. Everything is all eerie warnings, weird color-coded rules, and elders acting <em>way</em> too suspicious, so you just <em>know</em> something fishy is going on. Then Shyamalan hopes you’re blown away by the reveal of it actually not being the 1800s, but rather modern day, and the “monsters” are just the elders dressing up to keep everyone from leaving. It’s a wild idea that <em>sounds</em> cool, but once you think about it for more than five minutes, it’s kind of like realizing your favorite scary story has a plot hole the size of a barn.</p></div><div><p>At one point in <em>The Happening</em>, Mark Wahlberg has a full-blown conversation with a plastic plant, trying to reason with it like they’re in a hostage situation. That’s the sort of tension-building filmmaking you can expect from a movie that’s basically a paranoid road trip thriller in which people start randomly killing themselves, and a group of survivors—including Wahlberg as a nervous science teacher—scramble to escape whatever unseen force is causing the chaos. Everything is all eerie deserted towns, cryptic warnings about nature, and people running from the wind, so you just know the twist is going to be completely bonkers. At first,  finding out it’s the plants waging war on humanity, releasing airborne toxins that hijack people’s survival instincts and turn them into their own worst enemies, was laughable. But in a world where environmental disasters keep getting weirder, the idea of nature quietly wiping us out without us even realizing it is actually kind of terrifying. </p></div><div><p><em>Old</em> sits at a middling Rotten Tomatoes score that would’ve been even worse without an all-time Shyamalan twist, a last-minute reveal that transforms a goofy, sun-soaked thriller about people aging at hyper-speed into something far more sinister. The setup is classic Shyamalan, with cryptic dialogue, eerie medical foreshadowing, and characters throwing out theories ranging from supernatural curses to government experiments, all while their bodies betray them in real time. Then comes the big reveal: the beach isn’t just some random anomaly—it’s a controlled testing ground where a pharmaceutical company fast-forwards human lives to trial experimental drugs in a single day. And sure, it’s wild, but the way Shyamalan unspools the mystery—drip-feeding clues through unnatural dialogue, disorienting time jumps, and the sheer horror of watching life slip away in fast-forward—makes the twist land with an exhilarating mix of shock and awe.</p></div><div><p><em>The Visit</em> is one of Shyamalan’s best movies ever, anchored by an all-time Shyamalan twist that transforms a seemingly lighthearted found-footage horror movie about eccentric grandparents into a full-blown nightmare. From the start, the weird old-people behavior, unsettling house rules, and eerie late-night noises make it clear that something is seriously wrong beneath the surface. I would love to once again feel the shock I felt the first time I encountered this movie’s twist: the “grandparents” aren’t grandparents at all, but escaped mental patients who killed the real couple and have been impersonating them the whole time. It’s an absolutely insane twist, but what makes it so good is how Shyamalan keeps you ever so slightly off-balance the entire movie—one minute you’re laughing at their weird quirks, the next you’re questioning if something’s really wrong, and then suddenly, everything turns horrifying in an instant. It’s Shyamalan at his best, flipping the whole movie on its head in a way that’s both shocking and completely brilliant.</p></div><div><p><em>Glass</em> is the culmination of Shyamalan’s best franchise, a grounded yet extraordinary superhero saga filled with some of his greatest twists, bringing together the unbreakable David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the fractured Horde (James McAvoy), and the mastermind Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) in an ultimate showdown. From the start, the film builds toward an epic, city-wide battle, teasing a grand superhero clash while subtly planting the seeds of something far more sinister lurking beneath the surface. When it’s finally revealed that a secret society has been working in the shadows for centuries to suppress super-powered individuals, the entire movie recontextualizes itself—not as a superhero origin story, but as a conspiracy thriller in which the real villains are the ones pulling the strings from the very beginning. It’s a bold and subversive twist, the kind that blindsides you yet feels inevitable in retrospect, proving once again that Shyamalan’s greatest trick isn’t just shocking audiences—it’s making them question everything they thought they knew.</p></div><div><p><em>Split</em> is Shyamalan’s most disturbing film, a psychological horror-thriller that traps audiences inside the fractured mind of Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a man with 23 personalities, one of whom—the monstrous Beast—is preparing to emerge. The film subtly hints at something larger than Kevin’s disorder, using whispers of his past trauma, his seemingly superhuman resilience, and an eerie sense that his story is part of something much bigger. When Bruce Willis’ David Dunn shows up in the final scene, confirming that <em>Split</em> is secretly a sequel to <em>Unbreakable</em>, the entire film shifts from a self-contained thriller to a groundbreaking expansion of Shyamalan’s own superhero mythology. It’s a masterstroke of storytelling, a twist so unexpected yet seamlessly woven into the narrative that it doesn’t just change <em>Split</em>—it changes the way we see <em>Unbreakable</em>, proving Shyamalan’s ability to surprise is as sharp as ever.</p></div><div><p><em>Unbreakable</em> is the foundation of Shyamalan’s best franchise, a meticulously crafted deconstruction of superhero mythology disguised as a psychological thriller. With haunting precision, it follows David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the lone survivor of a catastrophic train crash, as he gradually uncovers his extraordinary abilities under the guidance of the enigmatic Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). The film masterfully builds tension, transforming seemingly ordinary moments into revelations, all while unraveling a story about fate, power, and belief. By the time David fully embraces his role, the film delivers its stunning twist—Elijah, his supposed mentor, is in fact the orchestrator of countless tragedies, including the train crash itself, all in a desperate bid to find someone like him.</p><p>It’s a genius reversal that not only recasts Elijah as a villain but reframes the entire movie as his origin story, making the audience realize they were witnessing the rise of Mr. Glass all along.</p></div><div><p><em>The Sixth Sense</em> is the film that launched M. Night Shyamalan into the spotlight, delivering a masterfully crafted thriller with a twist that has endured in popular culture for over two decades. From the opening moments, the film builds an atmosphere of quiet sorrow, following Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) as he tries to help a boy who claims to see ghosts, all while subtly layering in clues that something is deeply wrong. Every seemingly mundane interaction, every lingering silence, and every emotional beat carefully sets the stage for the shocking revelation that Malcolm has been dead the entire time. More than just a jaw-dropping moment, the twist became a cultural touchstone, referenced and parodied endlessly, proving that Shyamalan’s ability to redefine an entire story with a single moment is what makes him one of cinema’s most unforgettable storytellers. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 0.16.2.0 patch has been released, introducing a slew of upgrades and improvements to the game’s AI across both PvP and PvE platforms. This upgrade was touted by Battlestate Games a couple of weeks ago following the publication of results from an in-game survey.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, patch 0.16.2.0 also boosts Boss spawn chances and heightens the chances of running into Cultists in both PvE and PvP. Those who were struggling with Partisan appearing in too many PvE raids (like myself) can rest easy – his spawn rate has been dropped globally with this patch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ai-evolution">AI Evolution</h2>



<p>The 0.16.2.0 patch in Escape from Tarkov brings a wide variety of changes to AI enemies, including Scavs, Rogues, Raiders, and Bosses:</p>



<ul>
<li>All Sniper Scavs and regular Scavs of any difficulty now have 30 head HP</li>



<li>Increased the chance for AI PMCs to perceive an AI Scav as hostile to 80%. Other chances of faction relationships remain the same in all locations</li>



<li>Bots now turn their head towards the presumed target to obtain better visual</li>



<li>The detection speed for Hard difficulty bots is now equal to that of Normal difficulty bots</li>



<li>Adjusted the detection speed settings for AI PMCs. Now, they detect enemies 20% faster than regular bots</li>



<li>AI PMCs now also switch to single fire at long ranges. At close ranges, they will switch to full auto if possible</li>



<li>Regular bots no longer take cover in vegetation</li>



<li>Bots can no longer see through vegetation unless an enemy is very close to them</li>



<li>Bot vision is reduced if they are inside the vegetation</li>



<li>Increased the current and maximum durability of all AI PMC weapons</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games has also adjusted a few <strong>Player Scav </strong>mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted the spawn time for Player Scavs: they now spawn no earlier than 17 minutes after the start of the raid on most of the locations, excluding Factory, Reserve, and low-level Ground Zero</li>



<li>Increased the chance of spawning with better Scav equipment if the player has a high standing with Fence<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Further optimisations were made to the game’s overall stability, with special attention being paid to the new iteration of Customs. In-raid memory consumption has been adjusted on all maps, and shadow quality settings have been tweaked to consider low-end PCs.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games has also delivered a slew of bug fixes with the 0.16.2.0 patch, adjusting some of the most common concerns like bots teleporting through doors and rewards going missing from Cultist Circle redemptions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-announces-shut-down-just-9-months-after-launch-steam-release-appears-scrapped<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">I fear something terrible has happened.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-hunters">Star Wars Hunters</a> publisher Zynga has announced plans for the game to shut down entirely just nine months after it was released, and it appears plans to launch a PC version of Steam are scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The NaturalMotion-developed, free-to-download team-based battle arena game launched on Nintendo Switch and iOS and Android in June 2024. IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review"><u>Star Wars: Hunters review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Star Wars: Hunters’ lighthearted PvP fun is like a party at the Death Star: Impressive for a bit, but probably not a place you’ll want to hang around for too long.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems the review was prescient, as <a href="https://starwarshunters.com/news/sunset-on-vespaara/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zynga announced</a> that “after careful consideration” it had decided the final content update for Star Wars: Hunters across all platforms would be released on April 15, with the game remaining playable until October 1, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand this news may be disappointing and want to assure you that this decision was not made lightly,” Zynga continued. “Your passion and dedication to the game and its community have meant the world to us, and we are committed to providing visibility and updates throughout the transition process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are the logistics: on March 25, Season 5 will be extended by three weeks. Zynga will re-run events and shop bundles from the Season, and the Ranked Season will also be extended, giving players more time to hit Kyber 1 rank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On April 15, the game’s final content update will be released for free and in-game purchases will be disabled across all platforms. New Support Hunter, Tuya, will join the game as part of the final update. Tuya will be available and playable for all users immediately at no cost, along with a slate of additional in-game content. Zynga will continue to run a final Ranked Mode leaderboard for players to compete in and run all battlefields and game modes in rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then, on October 1, online servers will officially shut down, and Star Wars: Hunters will no longer be playable beyond this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no mention of the PC version, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-confirmed-for-pc-via-steam-early-access-in-2025">which was announced to launch on Steam in early access form this year</a>, in the shutdown notice. Its Steam page now includes a notice that the game is “no longer available on the Steam store.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two-owned Zynga is best known for mobile games FarmVille, Words with Friends, and CSR Racing, but with Star Wars: Hunters it branched out to console for the first time. Similarly, Star Wars: Hunters was meant to be the first Zynga-published game to launch on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The success of Star Wars: Hunters on mobile and Nintendo Switch devices has led to our decision to expand the game to PC,” said Yaron Leyvan, executive vice president, games, at Zynga, back in November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is something our community of fans have been asking for and we are very excited to welcome even more players to Vespaara. This moment also marks a milestone for Zynga as we bring one of our games to PC for the first time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are still a number of Star Wars video games in the works, including Respawn Entertainment's third Star Wars Jedi game and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-star-wars-turn-based-tactics-game-to-be-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration-2025">Bit Reactor's turn-based tactics game set to be revealed at Star Wars Celebration 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You’ll also be able to send invites to your friends while you’re in a game.</p><p>As the company says, you don’t have to have a Discord account to use the in-game Discord features, but “account linking is available for those who wish to connect their in-game experience to their Discord account for an even more engaging experience.”</p><p>Currently, the SDK is “compatible with C++, both Unreal Engine and Unity, and supports Windows 11+ and macOS,” according to Discord. Console and mobile support is “coming soon.” Developers including Theorycraft Games, Facepunch Studios, 1047 Games, Scopely, Mainframe Industries, Elodie Games, and Tencent Games are already using it, Discord says.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, this halo device for Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631188/three-new-snapdragon-gs">just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 gaming chips</a> — which I’ll tell you about in a sec — is a <em>single</em> transforming device with swing out gamepads and screens. It’s called the OneXPlayer OneXSugar, and it’s one of the most delightfully gadgety gaming gadgets I’ve seen.</p><p>Hold it horizontally like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, flip out its secondary screen, then <em>rotate</em> its twin hinged gamepads for a more squared-off Nintendo DS-like experience:</p><div id=":R6bdber6:"><div><p><figcaption>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</figcaption></p></div><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</cite></p></div></div><p>If you listen closely, you can almost hear the emulation community jumping for joy at the idea of two different aspect ratio screens joined at the hip.

For one thing, we’re looking at nice but modest gains of 30 percent more CPU performance and 28 percent more GPU performance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">than the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a> announced in 2023. It doesn’t contain the Oryon CPU core that powers both Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for phones or its Snapdragon X Elite for laptops, nor the Adreno X1 or Adreno 830 GPUs that respectively feature in those chips.</p><p>And while Qualcomm Snapdragon gaming lead Micah Knapp told journalists that the company might launch support for other operating systems “over time,” it’s “really focused on the Android side” as of today. That’s because China is such a huge market for Android gaming, the company hints. “The perspective that Android gaming isn’t popular is a very region-centric perspective,” Qualcomm spokesperson Sascha Segan says when I ask.</p><p>That China interest is certainly helping produce some incredible looking devices. When Qualcomm first announced its last handheld gaming chips, the best it could show off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">was a dull batarang-shaped reference design</a>. Today, in addition to the OneXSugar, it’s got the sleek metal-bodied Ayaneo Pocket S2, an Ayaneo Gaming Pad, and additionally two new Retroid Pocket devices on its new lower-tier chips, the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and G1 Gen 2.</p><p>Here’s that Pocket S2:</p><p>Knapp tells me that his company doesn’t need to subsidize the development of Qualcomm handhelds, either. “To be blunt, most of them are coming to us to build platforms on their own,” he says. “People have accepted this is where things are going to happen, and now they’re just aggressively moving into the space,” he says.</p><p>Of the two lower-tier chips, the G2 Gen 2 claims significant gains of 2.3x the CPU performance and 3.8x the GPU performance of a Snapdragon G2 Gen 1, though I’m not aware of any particular handhelds shipping with that earlier chip, and neither Qualcomm nor Retroid have released images of its next horizontal handheld. The G1 Gen 2 boasts 80 percent greater CPU performance than G1 Gen 1, and a 25 percent faster GPU.</p><p>The Ayaneo Pocket S2 should be coming this month, the Retroid Pocket PR Classic should be up for preorder this month, and the Ayaneo Gaming Pad should be coming this May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/undertale-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toby Fox's classic RPG&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>has reached a new Steam player count record almost ten years after its initial release, and it's probably all down to a remarkable Steam sale discount.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/undertale-sets-new-concurrent-player-record-almost-10-years-after-its-initial-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>reached a 24-hour player peak of 11,071 yesterday, which is also the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/391540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time record</a>&nbsp;on the platform. Prior to the Steam Spring Sale's commencement,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>was averaging around 1000-1500 players per day.</p>

<p>It's almost certainly no accident that&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is currently on sale at a 90% discount, which means you can pick up one of the most celebrated and influential games of the past decade for one single measly dollar. Trust me, if you haven't played this one already, it's worth it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-books.jpg?itok=5IM3UcsF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-books.jpg?itok=jtVRx5Mf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new Steam player count peak.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't yet picked up&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam sale, you've still got a few more days to do so, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1901049377134907874" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">creator Toby Fox himself</a>. Even if you don't intend to play it for a while, it's probably going to be a long time before you can get&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>this cheap again.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, it's a turn-based RPG with bullet hell elements created by solo developer Toby Fox (who also handled the excellent soundtrack).</p>

<p>I don't want to give too much away in case you're not already spoiled, and&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is a game best experienced without knowing much about it when going in. Suffice it to say that there's more going on here than just a simple SNES-style&nbsp;<em>Earthbound</em>-influenced RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-deltarune.jpg?itok=B4adxtPx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-deltarune.jpg?itok=rSLJNJOs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toby Fox is currently working on an&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor by the name of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox is hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, the first two chapters of which are available to play for free right now.</p>

<p>Fox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">has said</a>&nbsp;that the third and fourth chapters of the game will definitely be arriving sometime this year, and he's also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that development will be "smoother" following a fairly long gestation period for the game.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/undertale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/undertale/9pjggx9xjxpb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/undertale-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and, of course, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility).</p>

A further quantity-limited pledge will allow backers to get a copy of the game, or two copies, at a discounted price.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is set in a mining town decades after a coronal mass ejection wiped out electronics and global communications. Here, they found the quicksilver, a substance that’s changed everything. Since the incident five days ago, people are dead, others are missing and mining operations have screeched to a halt.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Enter you: middle child of one of the richest men on the planet (voiced by Lenval Brown, narrator of <em>Disco Elysium</em>). You’ve drifted through life knowing only luxury and power, shielded by privilege and surrounded by sycophants. You’ve just stepped off an impossibly long train ride, wheeling an overpriced suitcase across the muddy cobblestone and nursing a four-star hangover. Your mission, or punishment, seems simple enough: figure out what happened, cover it up, and spin a better story. You’re a journalist, after all.</p><p>Different schools and methods of journalism will be your RPG classes: Gonzo. Investigative. Gossip. Conspiracy. Words will be your weapons, and you’ll make your own truth. In <em>Hopetown</em>, the <a title="Genres > Action [2,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s you take, the friendships you make and destroy, the change you bring — these things don’t just live in your head, trapped in consciousness and fading into memory. They take shape in the physical world around you, real in every sense of the word. Just like the connection between you and your environment, which is enabled by a unique gameplay mechanic dubbed ‘psychogeography’.</p><p>The environment all around you — the town above and the mine below — will change during the game, based on the choices you make. Wasn’t that postbox at the other end of the street? Wasn’t this road uphill two days ago? Wasn’t that gambling hall a pub when you woke up this morning? Things will change under your nose and under your heel. Make surprising new connections between characters, break longstanding friendships, and see what happens.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is being created by a team that includes a mix of industry veterans and fresh talent, drawing expertise from the RPG-space, as well as writers with experience in games, theater and screen. Team members include ex-ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga, narrative director Grant Roberts, technical lead Piotr Sobolewski, <em>Disco Elysium</em> narrator Lenval Brown, <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> developer Ben Babbitt, <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> composer Pawel Blaszczak and art director Astri Lohne.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kickstarter Live Now</strong> – The first video and key details on the project are available now on the <em>Hopetown</em> Kickstarter page, along with a number of time and quantity-limited pledge types.</li><li><strong>Continuing the Legacy of Legendary <a title="Genres > RPG [17,059 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a></strong> – <em>Hopetown</em> carries forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach of titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>.</li><li><strong>Psychographic Mechanics</strong> – The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters.</li><li><strong>Gonzo, Investigative, Gossip, or Conspiracy?</strong> – Play as a journalist with different schools of journalism being your RPG classes.</li><li><strong>A World That Burns Bright</strong> – You arrive as a spoilt nepo-baby journalist five days after an incident in a Northern English mining town.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wyrdsong">Wyrdsong</a>, the next game from a team of former Bethesda and Obsidian RPG veterans, is struggling on with a "skeleton crew" after further departures from its team and a rescoping of the game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/talking-to-the-former-fallout-76-lead-about-their-new-studio-and-occult-rpg-wyrdsong">Wyrdsong was announced back in 2022 as the first project from Something Wicked Games</a>, a new studio helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> lead Jeff Gardiner and Obsidian veteran Charles Staples. However, progress on Wyrdsong has been hampered by the team struggling to find further financial backing. 
</p>
<p>
After an initial investment from NetEase, funding ran dry 12 months ago <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wyrdsong-developer-something-wicked-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs">leading to the departure of "most of" the game's team</a>. Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wyrdsong-the-rpg-from-ex-bethesda-talent-isnt-dead-but-its-no-longer-an-open-world-were-down-to-a-skeleton-crew/">PC Gamer</a>, Gardiner has revealed further departures - including that of his co-founder Staples and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-lead-quest-designer-joins-other-ex-bethesda-developers-at-wyrdsong-studio">former Starfield lead quest designer Will Shen</a>, who quit Bethesda to join the project.
</p>
<p>Wyrdsong has been reshaped as a consequence of these departures, to try and make the game more managable to fund and be finished.</p>
<p>
"We were making a big open-world RPG," Gardiner said. "The way I have learned to do them requires a lot of people to do that, which means a lot of money that was not forthcoming in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Wyrdsong was announced as a historical fantasy game with supernatural elements set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar. It was originally envisioned as being an open-world game, but this has been dropped in favour of a map with zones that are more managable to develop and explore. A roguelite system has also been added, Gardiner revealed, which fitted with the game's story of exploring what happened after death. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Gardiner is pushing on with the project, but admits that its future looks "very tough".
</p>
<p>
"We're down to a skeleton crew, and I am continuing to work hard to try to find further investment or publishing offers for the game. I'm hoping to sometime this year, but we're just trying to hang on to ride out the storm, which a lot of people thought was going to be over in 2025 and I do not see that reality at all currently."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-introduce-additional-graphics-settings-quality-of-life-gameplay-improvements.1136532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-graphics-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods, which are now available online, introduce new graphics options and quality-of-life enhancements that can improve performance and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The new graphics options are introduced by the aptly named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/816?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Graphics Options mod</a> created by Aiyke. These include mesh level of detail bias, foliage LOD offset/bias, the ability to disable texture streaming and dynamic shadows and to change small object culling ratio. While adjusting any of these options will impact the game's visuals considerably, it can also improve the game's performance, so the mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game with an acceptable level of performance.</p>
<p>While not every Monster Hunter Wilds player will see some benefit from the new graphics options, the vast majority will definitely appreciate the new quality-of-life gameplay improvements introduced by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/839?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All in One Menu</a> by Reena, which introduced new options in the main menu, such as the ability to access the Smithy, change equipment and transfer items directly from the menu, without having to return to camp. Especially during the endgame, Monster Hunter Wilds wants hunters to be out on the field constantly, so these options are extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the experience is marred by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">bad performance</a> on pretty much anything that isn't a top-end machine, the game is still one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074">embarrassing scenes of scalpers physically fighting each other</a></span>, something has to give if the card game is to maintain any viability for its wildly popular live game. To whit, Pokémon Center stores are removing the packaging from TCG products before they sell them, to make them far harder to resell.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-centers-wage-war-on-tcg-scalpers-by-removing-plastic-packaging-from-new-boxes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-centers-wage-war-on-tcg-scalpers-by-removing-plastic-packaging-from-new-boxes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by <em>VGC</em></a></span>, joining Pokémon Centers in Japan, Singapore’s Pokémon Center is now also removing the plastic seals from boxed products to dissuade scalpers. As <em>VGC</em> observes, this means it’s the first time the English-language version of the TCG is being treated this way.</p><p>It’s important to note that permanent&nbsp;Pokémon Centers are unique to Japan and Singapore, which itself remains deeply peculiar given the astonishing popularity of all U.S. and UK pop-up venues—to the degree where people have to buy timed tickets, sometimes via lottery, to attend the stores. All U.S. retailers are therefore third-party, and in a more complicated position when it comes to removing packaging. However, it’s certainly doable, given it only happens at the point of purchase.</p><figure id="" data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, there are those who would consider themselves legitimate collectors, wanting to buy sealed products to keep for their personal collections. And yes, for them, it sucks. Hell, I’d been buying one of every Pokémon Center ETB from the online store to keep sealed for a collection, with an eye on how much sealed products sell for once they’re over a decade old. Unsealed, they’d be worthless. But, you know what, even in my position the scalpers have made this pursuit impossible—the last three sets I’ve not been able to buy an ETB at all, as bots have demolished the stock in the opening seconds it goes online. Honestly, the situation is so bad that the fair point collectors make has become moot.</p><p>And things are only going to get worse, folks. Given that this era of the TCG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">is now looking certain to last four years rather than three</a></span>, there are big moves to experiment with the card game’s mechanic, and with that comes only ever-more collectible cards. With this month’s Journey Together there will be the return of Trainer Pokémon, not seen since the 2000 set, Gym Heroes. Then later this year the game is to receive the return of Mega Pokémon. These will all be boosted with stunning full-art variants which will become ludicrously sought after, and only make the potential for scalpers more lucrative.</p><p>The Pokémon Company International either has to match its words and <em>massively </em>step up production to try to flood the market with so much product that the scalpers are drowned, or all stores are going to have to implement schemes like the Pokémon Centers in Japan and slice open that plastic at the checkout. </p><p>Yet again, scalpers ruin everything.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony Pictures is working on a new Starship Troopers movie with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-film-review-a-marketing-exercise-filled-with-contrived-drama">Gran Turismo filmmaker Neill Blomkamp</a> - and to be clear, this is completely separate from Sony Pictures' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">which was announced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship Troopers film from Sony won't be based on the 1997 film that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> draws a lot of inspiration from. Rather, as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/">Deadline</a>, this Sony Starship Troopers film will instead go back to the 1959 sci-fi novel as its source material, which was written by Robert A. Heinlein.</p>
<p>"Plot details for the new incarnation [are] under wraps, but I betcha the movie is about astronauts versus bugs," reads Deadline's report. So, that sounds a lot like what I assume the Helldivers 2 film - which, again, is also in the works with Sony Pictures - will be about...</p>

<p>Back in January, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed the Helldivers 2 developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity. The exec said the game's development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>The studio's CEO Shams Jorjani still has some ideas for the Helldivers 2 film, though. Writing on Discord following the announcement, Jorjani quipped he wants as "many A-list actors as possible" to be part of the film, but there is a condition - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">he wants those actors to "get killed violently immediately"</a>.</p>
<p>As well as Helldivers, other Sony adaptations include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ghost-of-tsushima-gets-groundbreaking-anime-adaptation-on-crunchyroll">Ghost of Tsushima anime for Crunchyroll</a>, which is slated for 2027. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-breaks-hbo-record-before-its-even-aired">the second season of The Last of Us is due to air this April</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>All-consuming audiovisual VR odyssey <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thrasher">Thrasher</a> is getting a flatscreen release later this year, alongside the PC VR port of the game. There’s no release date just yet, but this port will let you play this successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thumper">Thumper</a> across PC headsets, gaming PCs and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRASHER 2D Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kc-UKVdHG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally releasing last year for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro, the game skipped out on PC or consoles to start with. We can only hope that there are plans for a PS5 and PSVR 2 release in this game’s future as well.</p>
<p>Coming from Brian Gibon, the artist and composer of Thumper, and Mike Mandel or Rock Band VR at their new studio Puddle, Thrasher looks to explore the rhythm action genre in a similarly dark and moody style. In this game you guide a space eel that is swooping through alien worlds in a race for survival, with players digging into a combo system that ties in with a chase to the top of leaderboards.</p>
<p>This was designed with VR in mind, fully immersing you into the game’s world, but it’s now being reworked to keep as much of that atmosphere when playing on a traditional flat screen platform. The visuals are being enhanced to take advantage of the power of modern gaming PCs when compared to standalone VR headsets. You’ll probably want to have a great pair of headphones plugged in, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/18/thumper-psvr2-review/">Returning to the 2016 classic Thumper in 2023</a>, Dom said, “Thumper remains a true VR classic, and its upgrade for PSVR2 makes it the best place to experience its violent audio charms.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 patent that was updated a few days ago provides additional details on AI-powered upscaling, strongly indicating that the system will indeed support the technology in some capacity.</p>
<p>As spotted by Mike Odyssey, the patent was updated last week on March 13th with some additional details on how AI-upscaling works, taking a 520p resolution image and upscaling it to a 1080p resolution output using a neural network. The 520p and 1080p resolutions mentioned in the patent may also indicate how the tech will be used in handheld mode, confirming the console's screen resolution, but there's nothing in the updated patent that suggests a specific use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo just released an update for Nintendo Switch 2 on AI resolution Upscaling. It's happening, folks! <a href="https://t.co/6GZUEXeBli">pic.twitter.com/6GZUEXeBli</a></p>
<p>— Mike Odyssey - Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Dallas (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1901107300581937596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Considering how the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by NVIDIA technology, how DLSS itself was mentioned in a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/"> previous patent,</a> and how Nintendo has already used AMD FSR in some of its original Switch games, there's little doubt that the console will support AI-upscaling in some form, although we will probably only get confirmation during the April 2nd Nintendo Direct. According to Kiwi Talks host Reece Reilly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-720p-resolution/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will be the star of the show, as its true, proper unveiling will blow everything else in the Direct out of the water.</p>

<p lang="en">In less than a month in the Switch 2 direct you'll see that Nintendo &amp; Retro were keeping their cards close to their chest with Metroid Prime 4 for this exact moment. The true unveiling will blow everything else in the direct out of the water.</p>

<p>The April 2nd Direct will likely confirm the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, which, according to analysts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">former Nintendo employees</a>, will be in early summer. The fact that<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/"> around 400,000 units were reportedly shipped to North America in January</a> suggests that the console's release is indeed not too far off.</p>
