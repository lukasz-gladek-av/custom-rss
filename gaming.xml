<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on December 18, and, as many could assume, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the awards</a> for Game of the Year and Debut Game. However, things have changed and The Indie Game Awards are making a big decision to strip the Clair Obscur and developer Sandfall Interactive of their awards over the use of gen AI in the game.</p>



<p>In an announcement made on Saturday afternoon, Six One Indie, the creators of the show, said that it’s removal comes after the discovery after voting was done, and the show was recorded.</p>







<p><strong>“The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,”</strong> <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.”</strong></p>



<p>Six One Indie ended by thanking the community for being patient and providing feedback on the situation.</p>



<p><strong>“The organizational team behind the ceremony is a small crew with big ambitions, and The Indie Game Awards can only grow with your help and support,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We already can’t wait for the 2026 ceremony!”</strong></p>







<p>With Clair Obscur’s disqualification, the awards will now go to the runner ups. That means the award for Debut Game goes to Sorry We’re Closed while Game of the Year now goes to Blue Prince.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-sports-and-racing-games-2025/</link>
            <guid>1389178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Most years, when looking around at the best sports and racing games of the year, the list is dominated by annual releases, partly because they are sometimes the only sports and racing games to hit shelves in the last twelve months. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/">Our list for 2024's best sports and racing games</a></strong> can certainly be defined by that, but 2025 is a different beast.</p>



<p>In fact, 2025 was a standout year for sports games and racing games, the likes of which we're not used to seeing. With that said, let's dig into our top picks for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-8-5-10">Mario Kart World (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-MarioKartWorld.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World was the first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, Mario Kart World was an expansive return for the franchise and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">the major first-party Nintendo launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It brought the series out of its tried-and-true racing formula and put players into a vast open world, littered with collectibles for players to find, mini-challenges, and the chance to just drive over to every track included in the game.</p>



<p>Grand Prix race tracks are connected with long-winding roads, rather than the game cutting to a loading screen and lining up all of the cars at the starting track. You could now also control your vehicle like it's a Tony Hawk game, with grindrails and tricks impacting gameplay to such a degree that we've seen shortcut clips that would've previously only been possible by actually glitching through the game.</p>



<p>All of that sounds great, and for the most part, it is, but the big question around it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/"> whether it was worth $80 or not</a>, as Mario Kart World was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title to bump up game prices by another $10.</p>



<p>While only you can decided for yourself if a game is worth the price of admission, Wccftech's Nathan Birch summarizes the game quite well in his review, writing, "<em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4-8-5-10">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tony-Hawk-Pro-Skater-34-Review-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 rounded out the remasters for the first four Tony Hawk games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of doing tricks like Tony Hawk, 2025 also saw Activision round out the remasters of the first four Tony Hawk Pro Skater games with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, though this time it was Iron Galaxy at the helm of its development, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">after Vicarious Visions was swallowed up by Blizzard.</a></p>



<p>Though it's not exactly the straightforward remaster/remake in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was, due to how much about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was changed, it is still able to capture the fun of those skating games and provide more than a solid escape for anyone wanting to revisit those titles.</p>



<p>As I said in my review, "<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-8-10">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Racing-CrossWorlds-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds made 2025 the year of the kart racer.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yet another kart racer on the list, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arrived later in the year to try and give Mario Kart World a run for its money. Depending on who you ask, it did exactly that, as it is an incredibly fast game stuffed to the brim with character collaborations and the kind of structure kart racing fans are more used to seeing.</p>



<p>While Mario Kart World looked to try something new, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds went for tried-and-true methods and tried to polish them to a near-perfect shine. It may not have perfectly hit its mark, but it at the very least brushed Mario Kart in a way that Nintendo would do well to remember. Because the next time a Sonic game and a Mario Kart game go head-to-head, the plumber's reign may just be toppled by a blue blur.</p>



<p>Nathan Birch's review summarized how close Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds gets perfectly, writing, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-f1-25-8-10">F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F1-25.png"></a><figcaption><em>EA Sports F1 25. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The only annualized sports game in our top five list, F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-f1-26-not-happening-f1-25-major-expansion-f1-27/">which won't actually count as an annualized release next year since EA and Codemasters are skipping F1 26</a>), is able to inch into the list on the back of its established formula and known pedigree.</p>



<p>EA and Codemasters would have to actively sabotage the game at this point to turn out a bad one, and while it's a more than fair criticism to point out how little each new installment improves on the last when they are pumped out on a yearly basis, that doesn't diminish the overall quality on display.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray puts it in his review, "<em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-7-5-10">Rematch (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rematch-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rematch. Image credit: Sloclap</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The one entry on the list that isn't about what you can do on four wheels, Rematch, was a breath of fresh air in terms of the kinds of football games we're accustomed to. Sifu developer Sloclap took its experience in making extremely detailed, well-animated physical bodies that move with precision, and adapted that to a 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 arcade football game that plays like someone having the idea of taking the cars out of Rocket League and shrinking the ball down to the size a human would need.</p>



<p>Its launch was unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">marred by technical issues</a>, matchmaking problems, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">a lack of cross-play that was not announced until hours before the game would actually release</a>. It has improved on all of those fronts, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-crossplay-support-live-patch-3/">full cross-play support now included</a> and several bug-fixing updates having been pushed.</p>



<p>But it's unfortunate that these issues, along with a few issues with the UI/UX, caused it to stumble from the start, because outside of those problems, Rematch is arguably one of the best sports games to hit the market in years.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience</em>."</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>



<p>The five games above are our top picks for the year overall, but there are still a few games worth mentioning that didn't make the cut. If you're a fan of sports and racing games, you would do well to check out these games too.</p>

            <p>
The end of a very short era is here! I guess, if you care about the life cycles of tech products made by multi-billion dollar companies. It appears that the days of the original LCD model of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> is coming to an end, as a quiet notice from Valve suggests their focus will be with the slightly newer, shinier OLED line of handheld gaming devices.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/valve-discontinuing-the-last-steam-deck-lcd-model/">GamingOnLinux</a>, heading to the store page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a> sees you being greeted with the usual spiel about how good it is, the games you can play on it, which models you can buy, and now, this note: "We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available." That kind of says it all really, but essentially, if you were putting off buying one, don't like buying tech second hand, and aren't particularly fussed about screen quality, there's your warning.
</p>
<p>
The original Steam Deck, this LCD model, launched back in February, 2022, so we're coming up to its fourth anniversary. Our own James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-review">liked it quite a lot back then</a>, and then a little under two years after it launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-the-steam-deck-oled-with-an-upgraded-screen-and-longer-battery-life">Valve announced the OLED model</a>. No real surprise there considering those Nintendo guys did the same thing, the difference there being they're still shifting original Switches alongside the OLED upgrade. I can only assume that Valve just aren't selling enough of the LCD version to justify its continued production.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next big thing for Valve right now is their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">new attempt at a Steam Machine</a>. A new Steam Deck will surely come at some point, though according to the House of Gabe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-have-to-keep-waiting-for-a-steam-deck-2-because-valve-says-the-tech-isnt-there-for-it-just-yet">you'll be waiting a while longer for it</a>. Perhaps an LCD model is all any of us really need right now.

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Accessible Games of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-accessible-games-of-2025</link>
            <guid>1389160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s December, meaning it’s the most wonderful time of the year. Yes, I’m cliché and enjoy the holidays for the warmth and celebrations they bring, but today I’m more interested in reflecting on the evolution of accessibility throughout 2025. And thankfully, this year brought improvements to long-standing franchises, as well as surprise additions to the triple-A and indie scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From my perspective, there were no accessibility moments that revolutionized the industry in 2025. Instead, the year demonstrated a continuous evolution of what disabled players have rightfully come to expect when purchasing a new release. In my opinion, no one game has been better than another, especially in terms of innovation, but that’s not to say this year didn’t surprise me in unexpected ways. So, for this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/columns/access-designed">Access Designed</a>, let’s explore some of my favorite examples of accessibility during 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: and Roger</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-and-roger-1765286660135.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This section contains mild spoilers for and Roger.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inclusion of TearyHand Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/and-roger">and Roger</a> on my list may surprise some. This roughly hour-long visual novel features numerous quick-time events that guide you through the loving memories of Sofia and her husband, Roger, as Sofia succumbs to dementia. Each minigame puts you directly in control of Sofia as she completes everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, making soup, or looking through old photographs. While these may seem mundane activities, Sofia’s dementia makes each simple event feel like a monumental task. And for disabled players, the intensity of the QTEs is exacerbated by the game’s notable lack of accessibility features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger features no accessibility tools to help you complete the game. There are no alternatives to finishing QTEs, options to skip them, or settings that have the game natively complete them for you like in this year's Assassin’s Creed Shadows. You are forced to continuously mash or perfectly drag a white button for every single QTE, something that was immensely exhausting with my physical disabilities. Yet, after completing an event within the first chapter that had Sofia push Roger’s hand away by rapidly mashing a button on the screen, I realized its inaccessibility made the experience much more powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger, through its lack of accessibility, made me reevaluate how I critique games, something I’ve been professionally doing for six years. Sofia’s struggles with dementia were far more pronounced when I was struggling with her. And in an industry where proper disability representation is still relatively lacking, and Roger masterfully captures the truest expression of disability. There are moments of love, grief, pain, joy, and suffering – all emotions I’ve personally felt or witnessed disabled friends and family experience. I have never played a game so dedicated to having, and occasionally forcing, the disabled experience on the players, thus making and Roger one of my favorite games of not only 2025, but of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: EA Sports FC 26</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-ea-sports-fc-26-1765286682630.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I will be the first to admit I don’t like sports games. The genre just doesn’t appeal to me, which is admittedly ironic considering I live in a very sports-centric city. Yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> made me appreciate soccer games (football for non-Americans) because of its incredible attention to accessibility detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FC 26, like most games with accessibility offerings, provides customizable controls, subtitles, and colorblindness settings. However, I appreciated the features for varying gameplay assists. Shooting, passing, defending, switching, and dribbling all have their own settings to provide relief during extended play sessions. When I was too fatigued to properly shoot, I would activate Auto Shots, which would trigger as I came close to the goal. If passing becomes too much, I can simply increase the sensitivity, making the game natively pass the ball without the need for immense precision. Even as the goalkeeper, I can use assists to help with saves. And for longer sessions, I can activate one or two button control schemes, significantly reducing the number of inputs needed to play (unfortunately, one and two button use cannot be used in competitive play).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, FC 26’s greatest accessibility achievement doesn’t impact my disability. For the first time in the series, as well as in a competitive multiplayer setting, players can activate High Contrast Mode. Everything from the home team, away team, referees, to even ball color can be customized to increase their contrast. This provides blind players with crucial visual information when playing frantic matches. It’s easy to lose control of player and ball position when matches become intense, especially with online PvP, but FC 26 redefines what accessibility can be in the competitive scene. The potential to challenge industry perspectives for competitive games is why FC 26 deserves a spot among the most accessible games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Doom: The Dark Ages</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-1765286697173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, id Software’s latest in the iconic FPS series, is by far my favorite entry, as well as its most accessible. While the newest game includes relatively common accessibility options like customizable controls, adjustable subtitles, and varying difficulty modes, The Dark Ages adds new tools that redefine accessibility in this fast-paced game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shooters like Doom rely on immense speed and precision to slaughter enemies and complete levels. You are constantly dodging enemy fire, sprinting through levels, jumping over obstacles, and switching weapons within your extensive arsenal to play the game. And if you don’t have the strength or stamina to perform any of the above, the gameplay formula becomes abysmally inaccessible, even with lowered difficulty settings. But The Dark Ages has a solution: it introduces modifiers that adjust game speed, enemy projectile speed, enemy aggression, player damage, and even enemy damage. Further, The Dark Ages includes options to change the parry windows for melee encounters. Every piece of the combat system is customizable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With accessibility, there’s often this incorrect notion within Internet spaces that options and inclusive designs ruin the intended gaming experience. The Dark Ages completely nullifies this argument with its customizable settings, which indicate that the "artistic intent" is the experience that you as a player want to have. There's no punishment for modifying the experience. Whether you have a disability or not, you control how you play. Are you a masochist that enjoys frantically throwing yourself against an onslaught of demons? Simply adjust every setting listed above to maximize their values. In my case, I would customize parry windows and game speed if I was particularly tired, but would find myself increasing enemy aggression for more of a challenge. I’ve never played a game that allows me to fine-tune every aspect of combat, and that is why Doom: The Dark Ages is my game of the year for 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three games represent only a fraction of the excellent accessible titles throughout 2025. Assassin’s Creed Shadows, South of Midnight, Split Fiction, and even Kirby Air Riders all deserve credit for their accessible tools and designs. And while the three games listed above are my personal favorite, 2025 has arguably been my favorite year as a critic, not for the innovations, but for the continued dedication to disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.

            <guid>1389157</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The actors who brought their A-game this year. </h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a tough few years for voice actors. While it’s perhaps never been more obvious how much value they provide to a game’s characters and story – the huge success of Baldur’s Gate 3 and its beloved cast put the profession in perhaps the brightest spotlight it’s ever had – voice actors and motion capture performers face a daunting threat in artificial intelligence. That’s just one of the reasons why we wanted to honor the art of performance in this year’s IGN Awards. Actors bring our games to life, and our digital worlds would be poorer without them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As with our other awards, we asked the IGN team to nominate their favourite performances from across the past 12 months, and then we all voted for which one we felt was the very best example. These are our picks for the best individual performances in video games this year:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Performance in a Video Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Erika Ishii (Atsu, Ghost of Yotei)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-atsu-1766157147736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The role of a revenge-seeking samurai is well-trodden ground, but Erika Ishii breathed refreshing new life into Atsu, the protagonist of Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei. Lending the character a believable “rough around the edges” feel, Ishii ensures that Atsu’s bloodlust has depth. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Aaron Paul (Robert Robertson, Dispatch)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-robert-1766157163509.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Hollywood, which has long cast animated movies using celebrity movie stars, video games have predominantly held onto the idea that voice acting and performance capture is a distinct skill, and that hiring people who specialize in that is the way to go. But while Dispatch features industry titans like Laura Bailey and Matthew Mercer, it’s screen actor Aaron Paul who’s the standout; our review explains that he's able to deliver "a nuanced performance as a man struggling to hold onto his optimism while reconciling with who he is outside of his giant mech suit."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner–Up – Konatsu Kato (Hinako Shimizu, Silent Hill f)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-hinako-1766157181087.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Lending both her voice and likeness to Silent Hill f’s protagonist Hinako Shimizu, Konatsu Kato brought to life one of the series’ most tortured heroes. While many of us will have relied on subtitles to understand her Japanese-language lines, her delivery helped instill every scene with the heavy, complex emotions intended by the script’s nuanced tale.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up – Ben Starr (Verso, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-verso-1766157194477.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Verso, Ben Starr was able to take the gruff, dark hero voice he adopted for Clive in Final Fantasy 16 and perfect it. The maturity of Expedition 33’s themes, particularly in its final act, allow for Starr to explore a character who must revel in tragedy, but who carries enough optimism and conviction to never allow the dark to obscure the light. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner – Jennifer English (Maelle, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/19/the-best-performances-2025-maelle-1766157208759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Maelle is the heart of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and a major reason her journey rings so true is Jennifer English’s performance. Grief is a difficult emotion to wrestle with, especially when it’s part of a story that happily leans into the melodramatic, but English keeps Maelle eternally grounded and completely believable. Expedition 33 may be a game with flashy combat, monstrous deities, and an army of goofy paintbrush people, but what it’s really about is the human condition and, more specifically, how we deal with loss. As Maelle, Jennifer English ensures that Clair Obscur’s loftier, more literary themes and ambitions are never lost among the more video game-y, JRPG-inspired tropes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While individual performances are important, a strong ensemble cast can help bring a level of consistent immersion to a fictional world. When everyone in an ensemble gives their A-game, there’s no fracture in your belief that these video game characters are genuine people. Our picks for the best video game ensemble cast are:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Runner-Up – Ghost of Yotei</strong></li><li><strong>Runner-Up – Hades 2</strong></li><li><strong>Runner-Up – Dispatch</strong></li><li><strong>Runner-Up – Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong></li><li><strong>Winner – Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations to Jennifer English, the entire cast of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and the team at Sandfall Interactive, as well as the casts and development teams of all the games we nominated.

            <p>
I've always found <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>'s Big Brand Collabs slightly odd, if a touch humorous. They don't always make much sense to me, like the SpongeBob one, though I will admit that the Shrek one does feel like a good fit, even if I am loath to look at intellectual property. And now here we are with its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, with its first bit of DLC freshly announced, sending prospective powerwashers off to a distant land called Ooo from the seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to a brief Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/542251341653737956?l=english">blog post</a>, this particular bit of DLC will feature a total of five locations from the animated series, due out in spring, 2026. Not much was actually shown off of the pack itself, but the math fans out there will not be particularly surprised to see Finn and Jake's permanent residence the tree house, as well as the castle belonging to the Ice "wow this guy was a bit too creepy early on in the series, sure glad they toned that done" King.

<p>
A roadmap was outlined for upcoming DLC and updates coming to PowerWash Simulator 2, with two more paid packs coming in Q2 and Q3, alongside three rounds of Caldera Chronicles jobs that'll be available completely for free. Other free updates promised in the roadmap include very vague things like new features, bug fixes and quality of life improvements, furniture and skins, and community events - all which is caveated with a note that says "content could change based on community feedback or development in the future."
</p><p>
I'm sure some of that will be even more collabs, such is the way of the world, but I'm sure there will be at least a few of you out there who will be happy to clean up bits of the world of Adventure Time. A very specific thing to be happy about! Happy nonetheless.

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <p>While every site you've ever visited in 2025 seems intent on summarising your year even for things you absolutely don't need to be summarised (the cards I completed in <a href="https://asana.com/year-in-review/log-in">Asana</a> this year? Uh, no thanks), there's one wrapped message you probably won't be getting this year: Xbox.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary">WindowsCentral's</a> Jez Corden, who recently suggested that the Xbox summary isn't just late this year, but may not be coming at all.</p>

<p>"Some of you have been asking me if Xbox would be doing its own Year in Review' style recap of your gaming habits for 2025," Corden wrote. "My sources suggest that Xbox is not doing a 'Wrapped' this year. And there's potentially a good reason."</p>
<p>As for what those good reasons are? Corden says next year will kick-off a "confluence of major anniversaries not just for Xbox, but some of its subsidiary properties too".</p>
<p>"Xbox is having its 25th anniversary, alongside Halo itself. Blizzard is also having its 35th anniversary, and Bethesda is having its 40th anniversary too," he stated. "Xbox was launched as a brand on November 15, 2001. Blizzard launched in February, 1991, and Bethesda launched in June, 1986.</p>
<p>"As such, a lot of the 'marketing budget' that would've typically been allocated to something like an Xbox Wrapped is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games."</p>
<p>Sony's 2025 Wrap-Up and Steam Replay 2025 are already live, by the way. If you've yet to see yours, head to the <a href="https://wrapup.playstation.com/en-gb">official website</a> for PlayStation, or pop over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/76561198023003792/2025">Steam</a> to see what's been keeping you busy there this year.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">flagging hardware sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams in January, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>

            <p>
I mean, all you can do is laugh, right? You've probably already guessed at what based on the headline, but we'll dig a little deeper into this all the same. Yes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-2">Ark 2</a> has been delayed, the same Ark 2 that was revealed almost exactly five years ago, that was at one point in time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-is-out-in-2023-and-its-all-about-dads-dinos-and-vin-diesel">promised to release in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-has-been-delayed-so-theyre-switching-off-survival-evolved-and-charging-50-for-a-remaster">2024</a>, and then sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ark-2-will-hopefully-release-in-early-access-by-2027-once-studio-wildcard-crack-the-dark-art-of-soulslike-combat">half-heartedly slated for 2027</a>, before landing where we are now, with the news that the game is currently planned for release in 2028. Uhuh!
</p>
<p>
This comes from an interview with Studio Wildcard co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz over on the Epic Games Store <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/sci-fi-dino-taming-survival-game-ark-2-eyes-a-2028-release-with-a-little-or-a-lot-of-vin-diesel">blog</a> (stop stealing our thing, Mr. Sweeney. "One of the things about doing ARK 2 was that we felt we had to learn a lot more about how to make the kind of game we wanted to do, and to do it kind of in phases," Stieglitz said of the delay. "Learning about both the technology and the mechanics seemed, to us, safer than to just try to go and release a whole standalone product called ARK 2."
</p>
<p>
The studio founder spoke of how an expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a> due for release in 2027, Legacy of Santiago, will introduce a number of combat mechanics that are planned for Ark 2, like its Soulsian third-person combat, but "it's not going to have all this like crazy narrative world build out content that we want to do with Ark 2."
</p>
<p>
Speaking of that narrative, it frankly, sounds like a mess. Stieglitz shared that they have a "much more ambitious narrative built out for Ark 2," but noted that, bafflingly, "it’s really going to be highly dependent on just how involved Vin Diesel is actually going to be, which is still an open question." 
</p><p>
He goes on to note that they currently do not know how many days, or even hours, they're going to get with the Fast &amp; Furious actor. "The scope of how much performance we are going to get determines just how the narrative is going to play out. We have a narrative that’s if we get a lot of Vin Diesel, this is what we will do, and if we get a little Vin Diesel, this is what we will do."
</p>
<p>
This, perhaps, is a lesson in not announcing your game with a pre-rendered trailer featuring a very famous and wildly mediocre actor who's too busy feuding with another mediocre actor. I await hearing about the game's next delay in 2029 with little glee, but much anticipation.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will not be returning to iOS in Japan next year "as promised" because, according to Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, Apple has allegedly launched "another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking".</p>
<p>In a series of messages posted to X/Twitter, Sweeney explained that whilst Apple had been "required to open up iOS to competing stores", it has instead introduced additional fees, including a 21% "junk fee" on third-party in-app payments, 15% for purchases made on the web, and a "new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/12/apple-announces-changes-to-ios-in-japan/">announced</a> earlier this week that it would be making changes to iOS in Japan, including new options for developers to distribute apps and process payments, acknowledging that the changes have been implemented to comply with the Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA).</p>
<p>"Sadly, Fortnite will not return to iOS in Japan in 2025 as promised," CEO Sweeney wrote. "Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores [on 18th December], and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.</p>
<p>"Apple chose poorly. Again."</p>
<p>In a follow-up tweet, he added: "They're charging a competition-crushing 21% junk fee on third-party in-app payments, and 15% for purchases made on the web (a practice the US District Court already found to be illegal in the contempt of court proceeding that Apple lost and the 9th Circuit Court upheld)." He then linked to a page on <a href="https://t.co/QDtWekKflY">Apple's website</a>.</p><p>"They're introducing new anticompetitive warning screens meant to mislead customers into believing their privacy and financial security are at risk when dealing with Apple competitors. They're imposing a new 5% junk fee on all revenue from apps distributed by competing stores, and intend to surveil all transactions within them using a mandatory reporting API."</p>
<p>He closed on calling the changes "an egregious Apple imposition on distribution and payments they have no involvement with, and a practice the US courts already found to be illegal and upheld on appeal".</p>
<p>"Obviously, real competition won't happen, and consumers won't benefit, when Apple abuses its position between users and competitors to obstruct honest dealing between them," Sweeney concluded. "This is another sad day in the history of relationships between platform makers, developers, and consumers, and we will be raising our complaints with the Japanese Fair Trade Commission."</p>
<p>It's the latest in the five-year feud between Apple and Epic Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-adds-cheaper-mobile-payment-option-to-circumvent-apple-google-fees">when the Fortnite maker deliberately added a cheaper payment option to its battle royale that circumvented Apple's own method</a>, from which it then takes a 30 percent cut. The case has rumbled on since, but has rarely felt quite as dramatic as in the 80-page verdict slapped down on Apple in May by the US District Court of Northern California, which found the iPhone maker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-offers-peace-proposal-to-apple-after-court-decision-tears-into-iphone-maker-accuses-execs-of-lying-under-oath">"in wilful violation" of the court's previous injuction designed to prohibit the company's "anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive pricing"</a>.</p>
<p>Sweeney has previously stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">Epic Games had lost around $1bn in missed revenue over the run of the case</a>.</p>

			<p>Despite being a very niche genre, fighting games haven't been in a better position, but looking at the number of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/">games released this year</a></strong>, this wouldn't seem to be the case. <span>With the latest entries in iconic series like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/" target="_blank"><strong>Street Fighter</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/" target="_blank"><strong>Tekken,</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/" target="_blank"><strong>Guilty Gear</strong></a>&nbsp;continuing to receive support with new content and balance changes, there's obviously no reason for CAPCOM, Bandai Namco, and Arc System Works to launch new games.</span></p>



<p>Still, the few fighting games that launched in 2025 are all quality games. Whether you are looking to experience a brand new game or return to a beloved classic, these games have something good to offer you.</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em></p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Fatal-Fury-City-of-the-Wolves.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Despite being absent from the spotlight for a very long time, SNK's Fatal Fury series continued to be extremely popular among fighting game fans. After a long wait, the series returned this year with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and it couldn't have done so in a better way.</p>



<p>Besides featuring the unique two-plane combat mechanics of past entries, City of the Wolves ups the heat with the new mechanics, such as the Rev mechanics that can enhance special attacks, open up combo possibilities, and more. </p>



<p>With a wealth of single-player modes, including the RPG-like mode Episodes of South Town, a character roster featuring both beloved returning characters and newcomers (including some familiar faces from Street Fighter), Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is rightly considered by many to be the best fighting game released in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-2xko">2XKO</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2XKO_KeyArt_YasuoDarius_Final-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Riot's Project L has been a known entity for a long time, but it's only this year that the fighting game community has been able to go hands-on with the project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/"><strong>now known as 2XKO.</strong></a></p>



<p><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/">Having only launched on PC in an early access version late this year,</a></span> it's still too early to know if Riot's immense expertise in multiplayer games will be able to make a dent in the popularity of games like Street Fighter 6. Still, it's undeniable that, leveraging the iconic League of Legends cast, the developer is creating a compelling tag-fighter that is easy to get into thanks to simplified execution of special moves, and harder to master with its deep assist system and interwoven offensive and defensive mechanics.</p>



<p>With 2XKO launching next year on consoles, 2026 could definitely be the year for Riot's fighting game. However, even in its current state, the game is more than worthy of anyone's time.</p>



<h2 id="h-absolum">Absolum</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Absolum.png"></a></figure>



<p>Although traditional competitive games are the face of the fighting game genre nowadays, the resurgence of the side-scrolling beat 'em up subgenre continues at full speed, providing some excellent games, such as Absolum.</p>



<p>Developed by Supamonks and Guard Crush Game, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/streets-of-rage-4-beautiful-brawl/"><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></a>, Absolum blends the same combo-oriented gameplay of the SEGA series revival with roguelike mechanics and procedurally generated levels, creating a remarkably satisfying experience with tons of replayability and an immense amount of depth thanks to the masterful crafting of each character's moveset.</p>



<p>While the game may be a little lacking in content right now (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1904480/view/519732795817328673?l=english"><strong>though more is coming next year</strong></a>), Absolum brings a new spin on a classic formula that works exceptionally well, making it one of the best fighting games released this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-virtua-fighter-5-r-e-v-o-world-stage">Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Virtua-Fighter-5-REVO-World-Stage.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With fighting games being in a better place than in past console generations, it was baffling to see how SEGA was neglecting the Virtua Fighter series, one of the first franchises to guide the genre's transition from 2D to 3D. Thankfully, the Japanese publisher eventually came to its senses, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/"><strong>a new entry in the series is in the works by the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.</strong></a></p>



<p>To bring back the franchise to a new generation of players ahead of the launch of the new game, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/virtua-fighter-5-revo-world-stage-october-5-debut/"><strong>launched Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage</strong></a>, an updated version of the latest entry in the series, complete with a single-player mode incorporating all the gameplay mechanics and tweaks introduced to the base game over the years.</p>



<p>Though not the new entry in the series fans expected, Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O. World Stage is a more than decent release to tide them over for the launch of a new generation game that promises to be the peak of the series.</p>







<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CAPCOM-Fighting-Collection-2.avif"></a></figure>



<p>Considering the current state of the genre, supporting more than a single fighting game is a real challenge for even big publishers like CAPCOM, which has been exclusively focusing on Street Fighter 6 since its launch in 2023.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the Japanese publisher hasn't completely forgotten about some of its older IPs, such as Capcom vs. SNK and Rival Schools, releasing them to the modern audience with the Capcom Fighting Collection 2.</p>



<p>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein, Power Stone and its sequel, the two Capcom vs. SNK games, Project Justice, Street Fighter Alpha 3 Upper, and Capcom Fighting Evolution, the Japanese publisher has made it easier than ever to enjoy these classic games, hopefully with the intent of eventually reviving one of these series with new entries.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As already mentioned, 2025 didn't see the release of many new fighting games, so there are only a few more games worth mentioning. Still, they are more than worthy of a look.</p>

<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review-somehow-marvel-returned/"><strong>MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</strong></a></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 has been a huge year for multiplayer gaming. From big budget sequels in major franchises, to emerging genres like the extraction shooter breaking into the mainstream, and smaller, more experimental indie games, there’s been a little bit of everything for everyone to enjoy – so long as you enjoy other people, I guess.</p>
<p>So, of all the headline-grabbing multiplayer games, both expected and unexpected, which came out on top?</p>



<p>When <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> exploded in popularity back in 2023, it triggered a major shift in the culture around multiplayer gaming – competitive argument-simulators like Jackbox and Among Us remain popular, but a new crop of games focused on chaotic co-op shenanigans emerged out of the woodwork. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/peak">PEAK</a> represents not only the best of that new genre we playfully refer to as “friendslop” – it represents the most fun you can have with a new multiplayer game this year, and it’s a major achievement in online gaming.</p>
<p>The concept is simple: it’s a co-op game about climbing, and if you and your three friends have to try to scale the massive multi-biome summit laid out before you. Fail to do so and your run is over. The fluid, physics-based absurdity of the game generates a million laughs a minute, but even in downtime and defeat there’s fun to be had. The game smartly lets dead players not just spectate the remaining crew, but float around as adorable ghosts, berate the surviving climbers, and even get in their face and distract them a little bit. It’s a wonderful blend of friendsloppy chaos and genuinely well-designed systems that has made it the best multiplayer that money can buy in 2025.</p>

<p><em>– Miguel</em></p>
<h3>Mario Kart World – Runner Up</h3>
<p>How do you follow up from near perfection? It’s a problem that you could argue Nintendo has faced many times over the decades, but was definitely true for creating a sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-8">Mario Kart 8</a>. That kart racer had sat atop the genre for a decade, presiding over both Wii U and Nintendo Switch as the best-selling game, and being exceptionally well supported with DLC through the years. So how do you top that? Well, you don’t, really. You turn right and just go for a drive through the countryside for a while.</p>
<p>Going open world is a huge part of what makes <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> feel new and different. In addition to having the many themed race circuits, they’re all joined up by a network of roads and environments that you can also race through – OK, that you&nbsp;<em>have</em> to race through because Nintendo decided to put really emphasise this. With larger lobbies, wider roads and more items, Mario Kart World is even more of a light party game than before. But then there’s the Knockout Tour, the Battle Royale racing mode that features huge map-wide races, eliminates players at regular intervals, and builds up to a real pressure moment to survive to the very end.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of chaotic fun, perhaps a touch too chaotic, and with Nintendo’s typical quirks like not letting you party up for matchmaking (that they’ve thankfully tweaked in patches), but it remains an essential purchase for any <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> owner.</p>
<h3>Battlefield 6 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>2025 was the year that Battlefield finally, well and truly, stuck it to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>. EA placed a huge bet in assembling a collective Battlefield Studios around DICE, and while some parts of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> have been a miss, the core multiplayer brings back a lot of the tone, feel and action that defined this series through the early 2010s. 64-player matches, defined classes, vehicular warfare are all here, and it’s great to get back to basics alongside some new and inventive game modes.</p>
<p>Through launch and its first season, the main complaints to lodge against Battlefield 6 have been a lack of large-scale maps that defined this franchise, and Battlefield Studios’ annoying tinkering to shorten match lengths and reduce player counts, and (of course) some rather silly looking skins in the battle pass, and then backtrack when the community complains that this is stupid and not what they want. But the core is still there, and we hope that 2026 sees Battlefield Studios build and grow around that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dogpile’s puzzles mix Balatro, Tetris, and a pile of puppies]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848041/dogpile-review-inde-game-steam-balatro-puppies</link>
            <guid>1389052</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One day, video game critics and journalists will put together a comprehensive study on the impact <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em> had on the industry — of how so many games that came after tried to capture its essence by adding complex systems to otherwise simple, easily understood games. Until then, I’m gonna play <em>Dogpile</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://dogpilegame.com/">Dogpile</a></em> is a deckbuilding match-3 roguelike that builds on the style of merge games like <em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24049020/how-to-beat-suika-game-impossible/">Suika Game</a></em> by adding a <em>Balatro</em>-like twist. The result is a cute, cozy (in both genre and vibe) game that appeals to both the numbers-go-up and the dog-loving sicko in me. Drop matching dogs on top of each other to create bigger dogs that reward you with points to unlock higher levels. The smallest unit of dog is a Chihuahua, two Chihuahuas merge to form a Pomeranian (at least that’s what I think it is), and so forth. The dogs pile up the playing field kinda like <em>Tetris</em>, and also like <em>Tetris</em>, if the dogs spill over the top of the field, it’s game over.</p><p>Merging dogs is the simplest part of the game. It’s where the player has the least control — everything is subject to the whims of gravity, physics, and trajectory — but also where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most thrilling. The dogs themselves are cute, contorted into fun, confounding shapes that sometimes show off a butthole or two. Introducing modifiers like making the dogs bouncy or magnetic adds an interesting physical component to the game — <em>Dogpile</em> is match-3 <em>Tetris</em>, yes, but built with a physics engine. It feels so silly, so “baby distracted by jangling keys” to say that a pug glomming onto another pug to make a dachshund is gameplay action worth highlighting in the year of our gaming lord 2025. But the little guy does so with a satisfying “pop” accompanied by a cute little “arf” that <a href="https://youtu.be/LiFz5J9DHig?si=gvuwe322wcDtZg4x&amp;t=23">like Benoit Blanc, I’m compelled</a>.</p><p>Though the game has nothing to do with poker, you can see the DNA of<em> Balatro</em> running throughout. Like <em>Balatro</em>, each round you’re dealt a hand from a deck of cards that have dogs as the different suits. Also like<em> Balatro</em>, you get money to spend on modifying your deck with more cards and tags that work similar to <em>Balatro</em>’s jokers. For $15 (of in-game money, there are no microtransactions), you can either buy a chow chow card or a tag that makes certain dogs spin in place to agitate the dog pile for more merging opportunities. When you win a round, you also visit the grooming salon where you modify your dog cards directly. You can give a dog positive traits like “friendly,” making them magnetically attracted to their matches. Or you can wash away negative traits like fleas, which negate any positive traits a card might have.</p><p>Building your dog deck full of synergies to increase your points is where <em>Dogpile</em> is the most like <em>Balatro</em> and where the bulk of your strategic thinking comes into play. I like to give my dogs the barking trait that makes them disturb the pile with a bark when they’re dropped. That combined with the tag that awards points every time a dog barks makes for a brain-pleasing display of meters filling up and cash register noises going off that really drives home the fact that a lot of these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloverpit-is-a-fun-not-gambling-roguelite-satire-of-capitalism-but-i-would-quite-like-us-to-stop-cashing-in-on-our-own-despair">well-intentioned, celebrated <em>Balatro</em>-likes</a> tap into the psychology of gambling addition to make them stick.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t feel very deep. There are no boss challenges. Failing to meet the point threshold doesn’t end a run, but instead makes you pick from a stock of negative events or traits that are either easily ignored or so detrimental that you lose the game immediately. Unlike <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Dogpile</em> doesn’t inspire the same feeling of endless possibility of the kinds of decks you can build.</p><p><em>Dogpile</em> isn’t the first game to complexify the humble match-3 genre, and I don’t know if its similarities to <em>Balatro</em> are intentional or not. But I like seeing how games can push <em>Balatro</em>’s formula beyond poker — especially if a dog is involved.</p><p>And yes, you can pet them.</p><p><sub><em>Dogpile</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/848041/dogpile-review-inde-game-steam-balatro-puppies]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even at $1,000, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">the Xbox Ally X handheld</a> didn’t ship with magnetic drift-resistant joysticks, and neither did the $600 model. But for an extra <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 at Amazon</a>, you can change that today — with officially Asus-approved and sanctioned TMR joysticks from Gulikit, the company that’s made a name for itself by supplying aftermarket drift-resistant sticks.</p><p>The company says it worked with Xbox Ally manufacturer Asus to create these sticks, that they’ll be “automatically recognized” when you swap them in, and that you can use the handheld’s built-in Armoury Crate app to calibrate them afterwards.</p><p>And while I haven’t tried these ones (I do have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button">a pair in my Switch</a>), I can confirm it’s pretty easy to pop open the Xbox Ally to install. Just loosen the Philips-head screws, poke in a guitar pick pry tool to create a small gap, and pull a little harder than you think you need to pop open the clips. The joystick modules are right underneath. There’s nothing blocking you — just pop a ribbon cable and undo their three screws.</p><p>Here’s the company’s walkthrough in case you want to see for yourself — though I do not recommend taking sharp tweezers to ribbon cables when your fingernails can do that job safer and easier. (I may have broken a few ribbon cables in my life.)</p><p>When we’re talking about TMR or the older and slightly less power-efficient Hall effect joystick technology, I usually write “drift-resistant” instead of “drift-free” because you <em>may</em> find your center point drifting over time — but the beauty of magnetic is you just have to recalibrate! Unlike the potentiometer joysticks that ship with Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Microsoft Xbox controllers, you’re not scraping away material that’ll lead to permanent drift as you use the magnetic versions.</p><p>Gulikit’s new Xbox Ally sticks are <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G4QW8798?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">$20 in the US today</a>, and should also be available in the UK for <em>£</em>20, and in Italy, France, and Spain for €22, this January.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848568/xbox-ally-gulikit-tmr-joysticks]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is changing vehicle availability on its Breakthrough maps to improve pacing and "vehicle availability" for attackers and defenders.</p>
<p>The changes, coming first to New Sobek City, are "part of a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps", and will be "actively monitor[ed]" to assess how they impact gameplay.</p>

<p>"Over the last few days, we’ve been rolling out a set of changes across multiple Breakthrough maps, starting with our earlier test on New Sobek City," the team explained in a social media post. "These changes are aimed at improving overall pacing and vehicle availability between Attacker and Defenders, and we are actively monitoring how these changes are impacting gameplay."</p> <div>

<p>Interestingly, the team is transparent that these change may not "perform well", but did commit to roll[ing] back some or all of these changes as our focus remains on steadily improving Breakthrough overall".</p>
<p>The team closed on thanking players for their "patience, support, and feedback as we continue to tune the mode", hinted further updates would be coming in the New Year, and wished everyone "happy holidays".</p>
<p>The last big update came earlier this month, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-addresses-primary-community-complaint-improves-hit-registrations-and-netcode-ahead-of-winter-offensive-update">Battlefield 6 received both netcode and hit registration improvements ahead of the Winter Offensive update</a>, which went live on the 9th December. It's part of the team's wider work to enhance both components of online play and is especially noteworthy, as issues with online netcode and hit registration have been sources of frustration for some players since launch.</p>
<p>This update came shortly after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-was-cheater-free-in-roughly-98-of-games-after-launch">EA revealed that close to 98 percent of its games post-launch were cheater-free</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-flounders-battlefield-6-free-for-a-week">a week-long free-to-play offering that allowed folks to try the military FPS out without breaking the bank</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1389040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When a friend invited me to play a new game called <em>REPO</em> earlier this year, I thought I was wasting my money — not because the game looked bad, but because it looked like <em>Lethal Company</em>. The surprise-hit 2024 co-op survival horror game has players wander through unnerving ruined structures collecting trash while evading monsters. <em>Lethal Company</em> was popular with my friends (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24040561/lethal-company-roblox-popularity-explained/">and just about everyone else</a>), but its eerie liminal spaces spooked me too much. My friends swore <em>REPO</em> was different, though, that it was so funny it was hard to be scared, especially with its goofy robot avatars — and they were right.</p><p><em>REPO</em> has become one of my favorite games, and was one of the biggest co-op titles of 2025, along with similar indie co-op hit <em>Peak</em>. Over the past several months, the two titles have become the faces of a new niche of games with a somewhat controversial name: “friend slop.”</p><p>The term usually refers to indie co-op games that are best experienced with friends and have an emphasis on humor. They’re typically PC games, cost less than $20, include proximity voice chat, feature wacky game physics, and often fall into the survival horror genre. Friend slop isn’t always scary, though. Some lighthearted flavors of “slop” popped up this year, like <em>Peak</em>, where you attempt to scale increasingly perilous mountains with your friends.</p><p>That’s just the tip — or rather, peak — of the friend slop iceberg. There’s also <em>Guilty as Sock!</em>, where you and your co-op buddies roleplay court showdowns as sock puppets. <em>Lockdown Protocol</em> takes inspiration from <em>Among Us</em>, a precursor to the friend slop trend, where one player attempts to sabotage their friends as they complete chores on a timer in a lonely base. <em>Mage Arena</em> is one of the cheapest friend slop games to arrive this year at just $2.99. It’s also one of the most unique — you compete in magic duels with your friends by verbally shouting spells.</p><p>Friend slop games tend to follow a similar formula: You and your friends need to accomplish something together, but the consequences for failure aren’t particularly intense (and it’s often funnier if you <em>don’t</em> succeed). <em>Peak</em> is a perfect example. I have yet to survive to the end of a run, and yet I keep playing. Winning <em>Peak</em> is great, but the most entertaining part is watching your friends miss a jump and fall off a mountain, eat poisonous food, or get chased down by the scoutmaster for running ahead.</p><p>In friend slop, the main objective is humor. Winning is secondary. If you’re hoping for a deep, nuanced plot, you’ll probably be disappointed. Friend slop games also tend to lose their charm when you’re playing solo. <em>REPO</em> just isn’t the same when there’s no one there to laugh every time you clumsily shatter a vase.</p><p>Therein lies one of the major criticisms of the genre and one of the reasons it’s been labeled “slop” to begin with. While <em>REPO</em> and <em>Peak</em> have been hugely popular this year, some say they’re just designed for viral, clippable moments and lack substance beyond that, partly because they’re not usually fun to play solo.</p><p>That could be a fair drawback depending on what you expect from these games. However, it misses the point of “friend slop” and overlooks a potential explanation for their popularity this year.</p><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> was also one of 2025’s biggest co-op games, and I’ve had a great time with it as well. However, it offers something completely different from <em>REPO</em> or <em>Peak</em> and feels drastically different to play, despite technically being under the same broad co-op umbrella. <em>Nightreign</em> requires concentration, skill, and strategy, whereas <em>REPO</em> mostly just requires you to keep an eye out for monsters while absentmindedly picking up junk. It’s also a much more affordable game than <em>Nightreign</em> and doesn’t hinge on any <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc">prior knowledge of other games</a>.</p><p>That difference highlights one of friend slop’s greatest strengths. For all their arguable faults, friend slop games are approachable. They ask little of you — both in terms of money and time. You don’t even need a particularly powerful PC. These games are a way for people to hang out with friends for little money and laugh with each other. To some, myself included, that’s worth just as much as a rich story or dramatic boss fights.</p><p>This year, we’ve seen the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">prices of games soar</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">gaming PC hardware is becoming unaffordable</a> for many. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789734/game-consoles-too-expensive">Almost everything about the hobby has become more expensive</a>. Friend slop games offer an oasis from that with low prices and low hardware requirements, staying accessible to a large swath of gamers, even more so because they’re typically easy to learn how to play. The very things that led some people to call these games “slop” are also part of what has made them so popular in 2025 in particular.</p><p>Paige Wilson, community manager at <em>Peak</em> publisher Aggro Crab, echoed that sentiment. “We actually think friend slop is a fire term,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “Sure, it started with the intention of [having] a negative connotation, but I think we always saw the term as funny and actually pretty accurate. It’s used to describe a low-cost game that you and your friends can pick up whenever, have some fun, hang out, and expect a bit of jank. I think some people might not view it as this, but we do!”</p><p>In other words, friend slop isn’t so much about the game as it is about the people you play it with. If that’s “slop,” then I’ll gladly embrace the “friend slop” label, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another game worth checking out is this year’s&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This title puts your inside the head of everyone’s favorite merc with a mouth—shredding through enemies, guns a blazing—all while you get to enjoy the voiceover provided by none other than Neil Patrick Harris. This one is not part of the Meta Quest+ subscription package, but may still be worth dipping into as it’s the biggest VR release of 2025.</p>



<p data-start="2185" data-end="2651">The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive upgrade from its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2. It’s powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, which delivers faster performance for smoother gameplay. The addition of outside sensors allows for full-color passthrough, letting you see the real world around you while using the headset. A new action button makes it easy to toggle between virtual reality and mixed reality.</p>
<p data-start="2653" data-end="2899" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6531/">With current discounts offering up to $50 off, now is the perfect time to grab the Meta Quest 3S</a>. The 128GB model is available for just $250, while the 256GB model is down to $350, making it a great deal for anyone looking to jump into VR gaming.</p>

<hr>
<p>For some, football is something to play; for some, it’s something to watch; for others, it’s something to be scared of in the playground. But in 2001, in Ecuador, football meant just about everything to just about everyone. At least, that’s the story told by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a>, a game that conjures the magic of childhood and football fever and makes it captivatingly relatable.</p>
<p>The game opens with you playing video soccer on an old console. As it’s gradually revealed that you’re sitting in a family living room, your parents’ chatter creeping into your awareness, you are connected very intimately with the protagonist of the game — its designer — Julián, a kid in Ecuador in 2001.</p>
<p>That year, Ecuador clinched a game against Peru, starting a journey towards first-time World Cup qualification, and everyone’s there for it. Your family are watching football, school kids are playing football at break time, overheard grown-up conversations are about football, and it’s blaring on TVs in bars and shop windows. The sense of optimism brewing around this national event permeates every aspect of life and it’s impossible not to be swept up in it.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161208/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This historic moment fixes the story in place and time, creating a little bubble of childhood. The nostalgia is flavoured with small adventures, like skipping school to take in the glorious scenery of Ecuador, aggravating your teacher, and playing out too long in the rain.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, this is all delivered in a variety of ways. That opening moment of playing on the console gives you a top-down, black-and-white football game, controlled with an innovative two-stick arrangement. The game then moves into first person, your “real-world” playtime football-kicking coming to mirror the console game’s controls. From this perspective, you sit in class, check your watch, skip school, talk to your friends, and, yes, kick around a football.</p>
<p>Much of the time, you're just an observer, building the sense of being a kid and following whatever is set out for you by the adults in your life. You listen to lessons while you wait for the bell; you ride in the back seat and hear conversations happening in the front. Among the passive moments are a variety of first-person interactions, almost always involving or adjacent to football.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161217/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despelote doesn’t try to riff on a central mechanic. In place of that, it develops themes of memory and childhood through a range of gameplay approaches. This keeps the experience light while making the excitement about the football feel totally irresistible. However you look at it, however you interact with it, everything is football. From Julián Cordero’s perspective, everything orbits around football, but other key moments in Ecuador’s history play out, too, from dollarisation to the country’s first showing at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
<p>This gameplay-light approach does mean Despelote asks for a certain mindset. This isn’t a game driven by challenge, mastery, or meaningful choice, and there are long stretches where your role is simply to exist in the moment it presents. Progress is gentle, more like turning a page of a book than developing gameplay, and the designer is happier letting scenes wash over you than pushing you forward. If you’re willing to meet it on those terms, the restraint feels purposeful; if not, this gentle vignette may feel too far from a traditional game.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161209/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, the game could hardly be more distinctive. The art, by Sebastián Valbuena, sees figures drawn by hand in black outlines on white backgrounds making up the cast of the game. They sit on top of hazily dithered two-tone scenes. This effect layered on top of the 3D environment completely disguises the level of detail in the world, its lighting and textures – almost anything that might normally contribute to overall visual impressions.</p>
<p>The graphics are therefore, in a sense, flawless. The art direction is expressed to its full, love it or hate it. In motion, it comes to life in a way screenshots can’t convey, and once you're immersed, the world is living and breathing. This is helped by the voicing of all dialogue and the inclusion of real video of football matches, displayed through the same vibrant filter.</p>
<p>All the spoken language is Spanish, with English speech bubbles written out onscreen. This adds beautifully to the sense of place and authenticity; I was transported to Ecuador and my imagination ran with it. Meanwhile, active sound effects and incidental sounds lift the realism of the world. Music is relatively sparse and often diegetic, with key moments of wistful guitar – but this contributes to a matter-of-fact tone that doesn’t overegg the emotional heart of the story. And an emotional response is what the game is all about. Yes, football provides a pitch for it to play on, but this is a relatable story even to someone with no interest in the sport.</p>
<figure><a title="despelote Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161212/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A slightly dry tone also makes room for some light humour. With Despelote, Cordero doesn’t take himself too seriously. A lack of self-importance places the protagonist as just one thread in the tapestry, which again builds a sense of a moment in history. A remembered story is always one you can’t alter, so drifting through this autobiographical account makes total sense. That said, if you’re looking for greater agency or action, maybe this won’t quite be for you.</p>
<p>It’s to Cordero’s credit that they also knew when to stop. The game tells its story without padding, then ties it in a bow and bids farewell after just a couple of hours. It lands as a complete work and can’t be criticised for being short – but bear in mind that this is not some open-ended adventure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With its distinctive presentation and light-touch mechanics, Despelote builds a mesmerising feeling of a community brought together by a fleeting football obsession. The historic moment of Ecuador’s journey towards World Cup qualification grounds the story in time and place, perfectly capturing the author’s salad days. Whether you play, watch, or avoid football, this is a beautifully-told story you can enjoy.</p></section>

              <p>PlayStation Portal Remote Players are great for streaming your favorite titles directly from your console over Wi-Fi, without relying on a bigger screen. These are great for gaming anywhere you want, from the comfort of your cozy bed to the lounge, or even away from home. On a regular day, you’d pay around $200 to snap one, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">Amazon is currently offering the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for just $179, after taking 10% off its usual price.</a> The offer applies to both white and black models, but there’s a catch.

Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback take the experience a bit further by creating sensations that actually make you feel like a part of the digital world.</p>
<p>Portal Remote Player requires broadband internet Wi-Fi to stream the compatible games installed on your PS5 console. Your Wi-Fi should have at least 5Mbps speeds to get started, but a high-speed connection of at least 15Mbps will give you a smooth gaming experience. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the console the a broadband internet connection, and turn it on in Rest Mode. Ensure Remote Play is enabled in Settings &gt; System &gt; Remote Play. Then, power your portal on, log into your PSN account, and choose the pairing option. You can also tap your console from the home screen to establish a connection.</p>



<p>Note that titles that require a VR headset or additional peripherals (except DualShock 4, DualSense, or DualSense Edge wireless controller) won’t work with the player.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera</link>
            <guid>1388980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you told me last year the Nex Playground would outsell Microsoft’s Xbox, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">even for two weeks</a>, I would have laughed my way out of the room.</p><p>It’s a three-inch cube of a game console that’s likely less powerful than your phone, one which uses a single camera to track your body. It only plays curated, <a href="https://www.kidsafeseal.com/aboutourseals.html">certified kid-safe</a> games. Though frequently compared to the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft Kinect, the Nex Playground is worse than either at tracking motion.</p><p>Nor is it cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$250 upfront</a> <em>plus</em> $89-a-year or $49-a-quarter annual subscription to get more than a basic sampler. If you like a game, you can’t buy it separately. Many are little better than shovelware and most are graphically ugly; I haven’t tried a single game with the charm or polish of Nintendo or the best of Apple Arcade.</p><p>And yet, lying sick in bed with a 99-degree fever, my five-year-old begged me to let her play.</p><p>When we started a game of virtual bowling, even Grandpa wanted in. (Grandpa <em>never</em> wants in.)</p><p>“I want to try again!” said my nine-year-old, after she sent her low-rent airplane plummeting to its doom.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>This one wide-angle camera tracks up to four people.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>They didn’t care that the games were bad. They cared that they were dead simple to pick up and play, no controller and no experience necessary, on a big screen. They cared that the games made them dance and jump and swing their arms, and that their dad looked pretty funny doing the same.</p><p>I just wish the games didn’t make them cry, too.</p><p>Nearly 20 years ago, the Nintendo Wii put an infrared camera and an accelerometer in your hand to tell if you moved your arm fast, slow, closer or further, and track basic orientation. A few years later, Microsoft’s Kinect captured your whole body with no controller at all: it painted your room with a structured pattern of infrared light to estimate your skeletal position in 3D space.</p><p>The Playground is different: a single wide-angle camera up front and HDMI and USB-C power around back, nothing else to plug in. But it also doesn’t “see” 3D depth. It has to estimate your body pose from flat images.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>“Holding” my bowling ball with a six-joint skeletal pose.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bowling game has fun Christmas unlockables like a gingerbread ball and toy nutcracker pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Sometimes, it’s impressive: by identifying just six joints — shoulders, elbows, hands — you can throw a bowling ball straight down the lane or veer it left and right. But with no real depth perception, it can easily get confused: my nine-year-old couldn’t sit on the couch while my five-year-old was bowling several feet ahead, because the Playground assumed all their limbs belonged to the same person. My youngest cried for several minutes when the eldest raised a hand and accidentally stole her turn.</p><p>Soon it was the eldest’s turn to cry, too, when the Playground lost her hand mid-swing and sent her ball careening into the gutter. She got mad when it happened again.</p><p>There are <em>so</em> many things that can confuse single-camera tracking, and Nex knows it. Warnings include: Don’t wear clothing with repeating patterns. Don’t wear long sleeves. Play in a well-lit room, but not <em>back</em>lit. “Avoid non-players in the camera view.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The USB-C power cable comes with a detachable magnetic camera privacy cover</em>.</figcaption></p></div><p>These all help a single camera tell people from their background — but parents know some are harder than they sound! Our kids get game time after their evening bath, which means PJs. Have you seen kids’ PJs? They have long sleeves and repeating patterns. Hearts. Stars. Smiley faces. Repeating cats and unicorns till the cows come home.</p><p>We had to roll up sleeves and rethink seating. Realistically, “Avoid non-players in the camera view” meant clearing the entire living room of anyone who wasn’t bowling, having them stand far off to the side, so that the camera didn’t suddenly snap to the wrong person mid-play. Sometimes we could sit on the couch with hands hidden behind blankets or laptops.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The bundled remote. Most games make you switch to it for navigating menus; rarely used for gameplay.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even so, my kids frequently got too frustrated with the controls. “I can’t keep my hand steady! I just can’t keep it steady!” complained my five-year-old, trying to send her cute puppy for a spa treatment in Nex’s <em>Nintendogs</em>-like game. Many games don’t penalize kids for swinging their arms wildly, but some inexplicably require dragging a cursor to press virtual buttons.</p><p>It also feels like the Playground lags behind my movements, even plugged directly into a low-latency OLED TV with Game Mode turned on. In Nex’s kart racer game, I couldn’t turn the steering wheel as fast as I wanted in its fastest 150cc mode.</p><p>Again, the issues didn’t stop us from having fun, particularly when with games that don’t require precision. The kids had a blast <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/mirrorama">with <em>Mirrorama</em></a><em>,</em> which turns your TV into a giant mirror with magical camera filters that let kids shoot lightning bolts from their hands, stretch their face, blur like as speedy as Sonic the Hedgehog, dance with their own clone.</p><p><sup><em>Mirrorama, above, made my kids laugh the most. </em></sup></p><p>They enjoyed <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/copy-cat-deluxe"><em>Copy Cat</em></a>, where they just had to strike a zany cartoon pose and let AI judge who did it better. Meanwhile, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwBAO7kifFA"><em>Brick Buster</em></a> to be an excellent Breakout clone — you only need move your body left or right to move the paddle, which is forgivingly large, and thrilling multiball action makes it fun.</p><p>I can’t say we’d get our money’s worth, though, because so many games are simple and inanely repetitive, or — like <em>Connect 4</em> <em>Bounce</em>, where my kid and I gave up trying to get balls to even go in — frustrating from the get-go. Many sports games are either laughably easy or have a large learning curve because the camera can’t see depth, so it can’t detect how you’re hitting a ball. With tennis, for example, you can’t aim with your arm: it only controls the timing of your swing. You have to move the rest of your body to aim left or right.</p><p>One of Nex’s biggest marketing points is that it’s already attracted huge kid brands to the platform: Bluey, Peppa Pig, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Sesame Street, How to Train Your Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But my kids weren’t necessarily sold.</p><p><sup><em>Bluey, is one of the better licensed experiences — but my Bluey-loving kids weren’t that into it.</em></sup></p><p>They seemed entranced at first with <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/games/unicorn-academy-friendship-adventures"><em>Unicorn Academy</em></a>, but quickly disappointed when they couldn’t ride the unicorn anywhere interesting. The TMNT game is a frustrating endless runner where you constantly have to hop into the air to clear obstacles, though I suppose it could help tire out my kids. And even though they love <em>Bluey</em>, my kids quickly asked me to quit its too-repetitive balloon-bouncing game.</p><p>There’s enough in the Playground’s library that I bet your kids will find <em>something</em> they enjoy. My eldest wants to go visit her puppy, and the other night at dinner, my youngest erupted into cheers of “Bowling!!! I love bowling!!!” when we said we might play it again. Despite countless tracking failures, they say that Nex’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> clone, where up to four people hop in the air to keep their dragons eating fruit instead of crashing into towers, is one of their favs.</p><p>I think the Playground is far too much money for not nearly enough game. But it goes to show fun isn’t all about quality of execution. Many classic arcade games are frustratingly unfair, even broken — but sometimes you just want another turn to beat the machine.</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/848449/nex-playground-review-nintendo-wii-microsoft-kinect-motion-tracking-camera]]></content:encoded>

Not just any ol' weekend either! No, it's the weekend before Christmas, which means it's time to start preparing your stomachs for an avalanche of food and chocolate.</p>
<p>This week in the world of Nintendo, it seems that there may be an alternative to those ruddy Game Key Cards after an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/nintendo-has-a-game-key-card-alternative-in-the-works-with-smaller-switch-2-carts">announcement from ININ Games</a>. We also received a lovely <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/divinity-original-sin-2-gets-surprise-nintendo-switch-2-edition-and-its-out-now">new Switch 2 Edition</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> from Larian Studios, so hopefully this is a little precursor of things to come from the acclaimed developer.</p>
<p>We also heard some rather grim news confirming that the US had its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">worst November since 1995</a> in terms of hardware sales, which may be partially attributed to just how darn expensive everything is these days. In lighter news, however, the highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> received <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/surprise-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrades-free-switch-2-demo-is-now-live">a free demo on the Switch 2 eShop</a>, so be sure to give it a shot if you're interested!</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>The Christmas spirit is well and truly underway at Casa Jim this weekend, so I’ll be bringing out the big guns with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Nintendo Switch Sports</a>. As has become something of a tradition in recent years, I’ll probably end up dusting off the Wii U GamePad and setting up a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/nintendo_land">Nintendo Land</a> to keep everyone happy — they just don’t make ‘em like this any more!</p>
<p>Sure, I technically still have a bunch of 2025 games that I’d like to finish before the year is up, but hey, that’s not very festive now is it?</p>
<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</a> on the Switch 2 at the moment, so please keep an eye out for my review very soon!</p>
<p>Otherwise, since I've pretty much finalised my list for Game of the Year, I'm in no hurry to try and play games that I might have missed over the months. With that in mind, I'm going to go back to something familiar and comforting... Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> – how did you know?</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>My head has been up in the (virtual) clouds since the VGA announcement of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ace_combat_8_wings_of_theve">Ace Combat 8: The Wings of Theve</a> so I got back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ace_combat_7_skies_unknown_deluxe_edition">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a>, a game that is begging for a Switch 2 update. The final physical games arrived so there will also be some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mandragora_whispers_of_the_witch_tree">Mandragora: Whispers of the Witch Tree</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/old_school_rally">Old School Rally</a> thrown into the rotation along with <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> (on my way to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/halo_3">Halo 3</a> now!).</p>
<p>Game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. It is my goal to wrap it up before 2026. So far up to chapter 9 and loving every bit of it. It reminds me we are but two shy months away from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Kiwami 3</a>! Happy holidays everyone!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I'm playing... oh dear. The same games as last week. Aren't I boring. That's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, and <strong>Astro Prospector</strong>. They're good! And I don't have the brainpower for anything new in the run-up to Christmas!</p>
<p>I'm also playing through the festive content in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_kitty_island_adventure">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a>, but that's because I wrote a lot of it, so... does that count? Probably not. Also, does this count as self-promotion? Am I in trouble? Please don't give me a lump of coal. Or whatever the Nintendo Life version of that is.</p>
<h2>Alex Olney, Video Producer</h2>
<p>My weekend should be pretty full this side of Christmas (we're having duck), but if I manage to find some time to squeeze in a game or two, I'll definitely be diving into Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition. I loved the original, but never delved into anything beyond the base game, so I'm keen to see what this new version can throw at me.</p>
<p>Felix and I are also planning to continue our time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/we_were_here_together">We Were Here Together</a> at some point as well, but that is... unlikely to happen over the immediate weekend.</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> is going to take Zach and I a <em>long</em> time to get through. We're maybe 35 hours through and the town building has only just opened up more. How long do we have left? No idea, and that's kind of exciting!</p>
<p>But for the holidays, I've picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a>. The latter I've been waiting to come to Switch for a while, and the former seems like perfect cosy Christmas gaming. However you celebrate, readers, make time for your loved ones and get some rest!</p>
