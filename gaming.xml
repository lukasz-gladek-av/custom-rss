            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been four years since Nintendo brought the first batch of Nintendo 64 games to its Nintendo Switch Online service, now redubbed Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics. For someone who started his games media career covering N64 games, this modern take on Nintendo’s legendary Virtual Console era was a very welcome addition. I ended up playing through a few of the games over the months that followed and was surprised how well some of them aged (special shoutout to Rare’s Banjo games)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunshine, of course. The games aren’t running natively and may not feel as snappy as you remember them. Some early emulation challenges, like Ocarina of Time’s fog rendering, were addressed pretty quickly, even if some others still linger (F-Zero X is still not as we remember it). And while there are many all-time classics to be found in the emulated library, I would’ve honestly expected a bigger lineup by now with a few more first-party hits as well as some third-party gems that have firmly entered the forgotten gems realm. Which means, Nintendo Classics is a convenient and cost-effective solution to relive the N64 age, but not a perfect one. </p><p id="the-analogue-3d"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="The Analogue 3D">Analogue 3D: Nintendo 64's Digital Offspring</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter the Analogue 3D, a modern – but costly – take on the Nintendo 64 hardware. See <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue3d-review">Seth’s review for more</a>:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with the company, it’s known for making extremely capable high-end solutions to play classic games on modern screens, such as the Analogue Duo (PC Engine/TurboGrafx), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/16/analogue-super-nt-review">Super NT (SNES)</a>, Mega NT ( Genesis/Mega Drive), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a> (all Game Boy systems – with adapters for Game Gear, NGPC, Lynx, and more), and now, the $270 Analogue 3D, capable of bringing both NTSC and PAL games to 4K screens, lag-free, and with additional bells and whistles, like CRT-style display options, overclocking, and VFR. It’s not a replacement for the Switch consoles’ ability to emulate Nintendo 64 on the go, but for purists who have or are willing to build a sizable N64 cartridge collection and want the games to feel and look as good (or better) as they remember, it’s surely the best way to play them on modern screens. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/analogue3d-white-1763781056003.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My Analogue 3D in white (it also comes in black for a more classic look.)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I preordered one day one, mostly because I anticipated some major N64 games that I still own to never come to the Switch service – though I’ll concede that Nintendo has surprised me before. For starters, I did not have the Japan-only Custom Robo and Custom Robo V2 on my Switch Online bingo card. Perhaps there’s more where that came from? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People interested in game preservation usually know their way around a classic gaming library and if you’re part of the Analogue 3D club, you likely have some N64 carts at home already. But as someone who reviewed Nintendo 64 games for a living some three decades ago, I humbly present this non-exhaustive list of personal favorites that are worth going back to and AREN’T yet – and in some cases never will be – on Nintendo’s service.   </p><p id="10-n64-must-plays"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="10 N64 Must-Plays"><strong>10 Nintendo 64 Must-Plays</strong></h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s kick it off with 10 must-plays, in alphabetical order. I've included IGN's Top 25 N64 games at the bottom of this article -- but these picks and other picks in this column are specifically games you can't get yet play on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote a whole column about this one as well, but EA’s Battle Adventure Racing is more than just a – now – obscure entry in the Need for Speed series. It’s a genuinely good racer in which the hunt for its imaginative shortcuts is as entertaining as the actual racing action. Given that the VW Beetle car license comes with strings attached (VW isn’t making Beetles anymore and may not be motivated to rubberstamp an emulated re-release), the Analogue 3D is surely the best way to play it today! </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/bar-title-1697833070747-1763780192081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Beetle Adventure Racing for N64 (1999)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Read my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/raising-the-bar">Raising the BAR</a>, for more on the history of Beetle Adventure Racing -- and its canceled sequel.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Conker’s Bad Fur Day</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Conker’s Bad Fur Day didn’t age as well as Rare’s best platformers, Banjo Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, partially because of its dated humor and references, but it’s still a great time. I actually played the original saccharine Conker’s game before it was retooled into the M-rated adventure we all know and love today, and historic significance of that “design 180” aside, there still isn’t anything as outrageously funny as the Great Mighty Poo boss battle. Even without the context of Conker’s roots. Perhaps replaying it will finally purge the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2DogLLDV_0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ugas’ chant</a> from my brain, too. Note also that the Conker: Live and Reloaded remake is playable on modern Xbox consoles via backwards compatibility. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diddy Kong Racing</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very strange Nintendo added Rare’s much worse Jet Force Gemini to Nintendo Switch Online before adding Diddy Kong Racing, but perhaps the combination of Microsoft-owned game code with Nintendo characters made it a much trickier title to negotiate a re-release contract for. Or maybe it’s still coming. Regardless, Diddy Kong Racing merged the stylings of Mario Kart and Mario 64 into a racing game with multiple vehicle types and an explorable overworld hub – decades before Mario Kart World. The Analogue 3D even smoothes out some of DKR’s framerate issues thanks to its ability to overclock. Given how long it takes Nintendo to make a new Mario Kart, I’m still hoping we’ll eventually get a true remake or a sequel – but lest you want to risk waiting until you approach Cranky Kong’s age you may want to just revisit the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Goemon's Great Adventure</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami’s been issuing classic game collections left and right, which is why we haven’t seen some of its best classics, like the Castlevania GBA games, on Nintendo's service. Goemon games may be more likely additions, since Konami hasn’t revisited them in a long time, but the fact that the only Mystical Ninja game playable on modern hardware today is the obscure arcade original should tell you something. Though they’re not as good as Goemon’s best outings on SNES, Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is a surprisingly daring Ocarina of Time-style 3D action adventure – and it came out before Nintendo’s mega hit. Plus, with overclocking, it’s actually much more playable than ever. Great Adventure, on the other hand, is a return to the 2D side-scrolling co-op action that may not be as original, but aged much better. Both are still fun to play. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/22/goemon-peer-1763780089988.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Goemon and Ebisumaru. (Credit: Konami JP 2005)</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">See my column, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/life-and-death-of-the-mystical-ninja?_cache=pass">Life and Death of the Mystical Ninja</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ogre Battle 64: Person of Lordly Caliber</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">entire column</a> about this true gem of strategy RPG and its predecessor, but at the risk of repeating myself: Ogre Battle 64 still rocks. Unfortunately, it’s also exceedingly rare and will cost more than a hundred bucks (without box or manual). If you don’t own it yet, always keep a weather eye out for a copy at the next neighborhood garage sale. See: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-the-legendary-ogre-battle">Forgotten Gems: The Legendary Ogre Battle</a> for more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rocket: Robot on Wheels</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve probably never heard of Rocket, but its developer’s pedigree has improved a thousand fold since its debut back in 1999. I’ve always had a soft sport for developer Sucker Punch’s inaugural game, but those curious what the people behind Ghost of Yotei, Infamous, and Sly Cooper did before they were famous will find a slower-paced, physics-based puzzle platformer featuring a long-forgotten unicycle robot mascot. Given that Sony owns Sucker Punch and publisher Ubisoft likely let the license lapse, here’s probably your one chance to play it again or for the first time. Criminally underplayed when it first came out, Rocket is worth another look.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Space Station Silicon Valley</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m convinced that DMA’s Space Station Silicon Valley will eventually join the Nintendo Classics lineup – after all, both its publisher, Take Two, and the developer – known now as Rockstar – are still alive and well. But until then, this obscure platform puzzle game is best played on original N64 hardware or the Analogue 3D. Silicon Valley has you switch between a variety of robotic animals to solve increasingly complicated puzzles. It’s odd, funny, and endlessly creative. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Star Wars: Rogue Squadron</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Pick: Star Wars: Battle for Naboo</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s surprising this graphical showcase hasn’t returned to a Nintendo platform given that you can buy the PC port for a few bucks on Steam. Until it does, you could do worse than play the Expansion Pak-enhanced shooter on an Analogue 3D or original hardware today. A technical achievement for its time, Rogue Squadron is still a very playable and fun experience today. I was actually surprised how good it looks compared to pretty much every other N64 game when I plugged it into my Analogue 3D. The Analogue, of course, also supports the high resolution display mode that requires the 4MB Expansion Pak on original hardware. Bonus: try Star Wars: Episode I Battle for Naboo. It may not have the benefit of the more memorable battles from the original trilogy, but it’s a quality shooter in its own right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Super Smash Bros.</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, I know. It’s insane the original Smash Bros. has not been released on Nintendo 64 Classics. Whatever the reasons, it still feels great and is a wonderful reminder as to how even the biggest hits started small. It’s the weakest game in the series with its limited roster of just 12 characters, but the genius of the series is already on full display here. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">WWF No Mercy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bonus Picks: WWF Wrestlemania 2000, WCW/NWO: Revenge, WCW vs. NWO: World Tour</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not a wrestling guy, but even I could tell that developer Aki’s run of Nintendo 64 wrestlers was something special. WWF No Mercy was always our internal top pick at IGN64 (we played it for many late, late hours), but any of the four Aki-made games are still worth playing. And given the complications with character and league licenses, the chances of them ever coming to Nintendo’s service are very slim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those 10 picks should be enough to get you started. </p><p id="even-more-n64-picks"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Even More N64 Picks">Even More N64 Picks for Your Analogue 3D</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here are a few more games worth checking out, based either on gameplay quality or historical significance, as noted:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bakuretsu Muteki Bangai-O</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Inferior to the Dreamcast version, but still a great example of what made Treasure’s games such rare delights, Bangai-O has you steer a tiny flying mech through a maze filled with enemies and relentlessly blast the opposition. Only released in Japan in limited numbers, it’s so ridiculously expensive to buy for N64, it would be really nice to get a digital rerelease.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">BattleTanx and BattleTanx: Global Assault</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was <strong>the</strong> multiplayer console of the ‘90s – but some of us kept playing four-player split-screen years afterwards, too. Stemming from failed console-maker 3DO, the two BattleTanx games were lesser known, but managed to serve up such addictive tank PVP gameplay, we ended up playing it almost as much as GoldenEye. Sadly, 3DO went under before they managed to pull off a hat trick. Prism Entertainment snapped up the license and maintains the trademarks for BattleTanx, but hasn’t done anything with them. Might as well grab the carts for cheap at a garage sale.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Body Harvest</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Body Harvest is not a great game – and its visuals definitely didn’t age well. But it’s an experiment so ahead of its time, it deserves to be played again. From the makers of Grand Theft Auto comes a fully polygonal alien invasion action adventure that lets you command any vehicle you see. If you’re intrigued, please see my column for more: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/body-harvest-the-game-nintendo-walked-away-from">Body Harvest: The Game Nintendo Walked Away From</a>. Killer soundtrack, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/13/bodyharvest-toys-1683937341671.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Body Harvest's toy box of commandable vehicles.</figcaption></figure></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Bomberman X4</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 is home to four Bomberman games. Let me break them all down so you know which one's which. The first, Bomberman 64, known as Baku Bomberman in Japan, is notable mostly for bringing Bomberman into polygonal 3D. It’s not as snappy as its 2D predecessors, but it’s still fun to revisit. It was followed by the single-player Bomberman Hero. The lack of multiplayer was confounding and the action is decent enough, but it's at the bottom of the Bomberman list for me. It was followed by Bomberman 64: Second Attack. This underrated sequel to the inaugural 64 outing ffeatures more multiplayer options, including two-player co-op and a four-player splitscreen mode. Not all of them hit, but it’s still a quality game to revisit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, things get confusing. There’s also: <strong>Bomberman 64</strong>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No, you’re not seeing double. This Racjin-developed game takes everything back to 2D. Which much better results. Only released in Japan, it’s a shame the real Bomberman 64 from the makers of Snowbo Kids is more obscure than the inferior earlier title. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Castlevania: Legacy Of Darkness</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami tried really hard – and struggled – to bring all its classic 2D series into the third dimension. It gave up on Contra 64 outright and canceled the project, while Goemon fared slightly better and saw two N64 releases, covered above. But you have to laud Konami for not giving up. Legacy of Darkness is basically a redo of Castlevania [64]. Its foggy, blurry visuals won’t dazzle you, but it’s a flawed and forgotten gem worth remembering. I still love that oversized “Home Depot Skeleton” battle. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cruis’n USA and Cruis’n World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a deep breath. I don’t love these games. Actually, I don’t even <strong>like</strong> these games. I had some fun with Cruis’n USA in the arcades, but only when there weren’t better racers around to play – which was rare, because contemporaries like Daytona USA were always near. The N64 version isn’t a great conversion, but I know many older arcade fans are nostalgic for both Cruis’n games, so it feels right to include them with a special callout.. I do appreciate Williams/Midway's early attempts to recreate arcade game on Nintendo 64 -- a key reason why Nintendo of America included them in their much-publicized Dream Team. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Donkey Kong 64</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m making you angry, I have very mixed feelings about DK 64 as well. The two Banjo games are definitely superior in every way, which is no doubt why both were prioritized for release on Switch. But for all the collection bloat, Donkey Kong 64 still has some memorable moments -- and music -- that make it worth revisiting. Plus, that yellow cartridge looks mighty good in either the white or the black Analogue 3D. Overclocking helps with its erratic framerate, but the drop in quality from Banjo-Kazooie is palpable when you play them back to back. I know, I know, many of you love it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Doubutsu no Mori (Animal Crossing)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing on GameCube was actually a port of Doubutsu no Mori, a Nintendo 64 “communication game” that predates it by a full year. You’ll have to be able to read Japanese kana to fully enjoy it – but also note that you’ll mostly be playing the same game that later came to GameCube as Animal Crossing and Doubutsu no Mori+. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">San Francisco Rush and Rush 2049</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The original arcade conversion was surprisingly competent, but the Nintendo 64 version of its sequel, Rush 2049, manages the rare feat of being better than the arcade original. The key to its success was the ability to control the vehicles while airborne, which made all the difference for this version’s battle and stunt modes. “Rush… It’s DANGEROUS.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gauntlet Legends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Atari was intent on reinventing each one of its arcade classics in 3D for the new millennium, and Gauntlet Legends turned out to be one of the few that made it and left an impression. Ironically, its blocky polygonal graphics didn’t age as well as the OG’s top-down sprites, but I remember having a plenty of fun playing four-player in both the arcades and at home on N64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hybrid Heaven</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not as good as you remember it to be, but it remains a really unique attempt at marrying Metal Gear-style action with classic roleplaying gameplay. Ultimately, the world you explore is just not interesting enough to keep most player’s attention, but it’s historically interesting as the only sci-fi action RPG from Konami’s Osaka team and because it featured a widescreen mode way back in 1999. Hybrid Heaven supported the physical Expansion Pak for higher resolution output on N64 hardware, which the Analogue 3D supports virtually as well. For all its faults, Hybrid Heaven remains a cool experimental game that unfortunately ended up a mere footnote in Konami console game history.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mickey’s Speedway USA</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m no fan of Mickey’s Speedway USA – to me, it’s the game where Rare’s considerable design chops fell victim to having to color in the lines of a high-profile license. But it’s unlikely we’ll ever see this Disney take on Mario Kart (with way too wide tracks) re-released, so snap it up if you encounter it in the wild. The marriage of Nintendo, Rare, and Disney seemed like the start of a beautiful friendship and Speedway USA is more of a dead end -- but it's still cool to see Rare try something very "American", even if its NASCAR with mice and dogs didn't quite work out. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Micro Machines 64 Turbo</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s a surprisingly good racing game, on the other hand. Unfairly overlooked, Micro Machines 64 Turbo is a top-down multiplayer racer that offers up super-fun four player action with 32 different vehicle types – cars, tanks, boats, helicopters – across 48 different tracks. It even features an eight-player mode via what it calls “pad share” (yes, it’s as awkward as it sounds, but you have to appreciate the total commitment to create the ultimate party game). </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mischief Makers</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Mischief Makers bucked the trend of making every game 3D on N64 and it’s still good for some fast and fluid action from storied developer Treasure. It’s not as good as Treasure’s own Gunstar Heroes for Genesis, but hey, not many games let you play as a brawling robot maid. We haven't gotten a new Treasure game since 2014, so even its lesser efforts are worth digging up. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mission: Impossible</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The movie-licensed Mission: Impossible may not be a great game, but it's worth adding to your physical cart collection as something that will likely never see a re-release on any platform due to licensing issues and the fact that it's a better museum piece than a video game. Mission: Impossible was a hugely ambitious game development project that didn’t quite make it to the desired finish line. It was pared down and became considerably less ambitious to get it out the door, but some of the great ideas are still to be found in what could’ve been a Hitman game before there were Hitman games. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as good as the Dreamcast version, Rayman 2: The Great Escape on Nintendo 64 is an excellent platformer that shows the limbless hero could hang with Mario and Banjo (unlike Ubi’s very similar 3D platformer attempt that year, Tonic Trouble). Rayman’s 2D outings have aged better, but The Great Escape is still surprisingly good.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Snowboard Kids 1 and 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64’s four controller ports and early success with Mario Kart 64 multiplayer inspired some developers to experiment with “Mario Kart, but with…” games. With Snowboard Kids, Osaka-based Racjin found the winning formula. Never as good as Mario Kart – or 1080, for that matter – both Snowbo Kids games do conjure up plenty of happy memories of playing against friends. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Fox Adventures</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally conceived as an original project called Dinosaur Planet, Nintendo had Rare add Star Fox characters and flight sequences to turn it into the only non-shooter spin-off in the franchise. Parts of it are much better than you remember. Like a Legend of Zelda with foxes. But other parts – like the writing, pacing, or Rare’s obsession with nonsense McGuffin collectoritis – are eyerollingly bad. “Yesssss, you found a BafomDad!” Still, I have a soft spot for it and break it out ever so often. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I know there are plenty of N64 fans who would put this in their top 10 based on the strength of its excellent Hoth level. Visually, it was way ahead of its time. But unfortunately, most of the game is marred by sluggish and unbalanced first-person shooter sections and a repetitive, highly compressed mono soundtrack. It’s an interesting failure that has its fans. Worth playing just for the Snowspeeder bits and the fuzzy memories. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top Gear and Friends</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I wrote about the original Top Gear on SNES in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forgotten-gems-top-racer-back-in-top-gear">previous installment of this column</a>, but N64 is a home to a slew of Top Gear titles, all quite different from each other. There’s Top Gear Rally, Top Gear Rally 2, Top Gear Overdrive, and Top Gear Hyperbike. The first one is still arguably the best in the bunch – Boss Game Studios, how you’re missed! Top Gear Rally and the Boss-developed street racing successor World Drive Championship showed what was graphically possible on Nintendo 64, while the Saffire-developed Top Gear Rally 2 added equipment failure to the mix for a more authentic endurance racing experience. Top Gear Overdrive, finally, is an obscure attempt at challenging Beetle Adventure Racing – and it’s quite competent. It’s from Snowblind Studios, the people behind Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance. That same team also made Top Gear Hyperbike – a decent racer, but not in the same league as Excitebike 64. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tetrisphere, The New Tetris, Tetris 64, and Magical Tetris Challenge</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo 64 was home to many quality puzzle games, some of which have already been released on Nintendo Switch. But there’s a quadrilogy of Tetris games that never got there that’s still worth playing. The visually-exciting but also confusing Tetrisphere and the more traditional The New Tetris are mostly notable for their kicking soundtrack (the same composer scored both), while the Japan-only Tetris 64 mixed things up significantly with new block sizes and different modes (and a bio sensor you can clamp to your ear). Capcom’s quality attempt, Magical Tetris Challenge, combines two complicated licenses – Disney and Tetris – and thus will never be seen again outside its limited console run (and the arcade original it’s based on). </p><p id="honorable-mentions"><h2 data-cy="title1" data-toc-title="Honorable Mentions">There's Even More</h2></p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best of Nintendo 64</h3><p>Here are the N64 games that have left the biggest mark not just on our lives, but on the industry as a whole. You can use this list to track which games you've played, make your personal Nintendo Online wishlist, or re-rank them and make your own Top 25.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How’s that for a list to keep you busy? No, they're not all great -- but they're all interesting games that are surely worth another look. There’s plenty more, of course, from the oddball liquid puzzler Wetrix, to WipEout 64, platformers Chameleon Twist and Glover, rally racer MRC, and some quality sports games like NFL Blitz, ISS ‘98, and NBA Courtside. Bored with GoldenEye? Eurocom’s The World is Not Enough isn’t bad. Plus, there are the excellent (but widely available) Worms Armageddon, Spider-Man, Vigilante 8, and some fun and goofy ports of StarCraft 64, Command &amp; Conquer, Quake, Quake II, Rainbow Six, and Duke Nukem to keep you busy. And yes, I know about Quest 64 and the Army Men games – more power to you if you enjoy them – but they’re not on my Christmas List.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you have any favorite Nintendo 64 games that I didn’t mention?

              <p>Govee has been giving Philips Hue a run for its money with its suite of affordable smart lighting products. This <strong>uplighter floor lamp</strong> is a perfect example of what Govee does best, marrying ambient lighting, RGBIC effects and practical task lighting in one sleek device. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/"> it has dropped to a record-low $125 on Amazon, down from $179</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tri-Zone Lighting That Transforms Any Room</h2>
<p>This floor lamp is impressive with its tri-zone system: <strong>the upper section projects dynamic ripple effects onto your ceiling, the middle zone delivers colorful RGBIC lighting, and the lower section provides 1000 lumens of focused task lighting</strong>. Control each zone independently or combine them for layered effects. Set up movie nights, work sessions, and parties with their perfect lighting.</p>
<p>The ripple projector creates mesmerizing, water-like patterns that dance across your ceiling and walls. The lamp head rotates 330 degrees, letting you aim the projection exactly where you want it. You<strong> can cover up to 215 square feet</strong> with these dynamic effects, which fills most living rooms and bedrooms easily. Govee includes more than 80 preset scenes in their app, or you can create your own custom patterns.</p>



<p>Circadian rhythm lighting is a feature that actually enhances your daily life once it’s setup: The <strong>lamp adjusts color temperature from 2700K warm tones to 6500K cool white throughout the day</strong>. Cool, energizing light in the morning helps you wake up and stay productive. Warm sunset hues in the evening signal your body to start winding down for sleep. The <strong>auto-run feature handles those transitions automatically</strong> so you don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Integration with smart homes works smoothly on all major platforms. The lamp is Matter compatible, meaning it plays nicely with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. With Voice Control, one can change scenes, adjust brightness, or turn the lamp on and off-all without reaching for the phone. The Govee Home app unlocks the full potential with DIY light shows and music-reactive modes.</p>



<p>The build quality is excellent for a lamp in its category: The <strong>solidly built rust-proof aluminum construction</strong> should last for years to come. The transparent black shade accents give it a modern look that suits most décor styles. The motors responsible for the rotating projector head work at under 25 decibels, meaning they are basically silent. This means you won’t have any disturbing mechanical noises when you’re relaxing or working.</p>
<p>Setting everything up with the Govee app takes only a few minutes: Connect to your 2.4GHz WiFi network, and it seems like the lamp is ready for customization. The interface of the app is intuitively simple to navigate, with easy access to scenes, schedules, and manual controls. Firmware updates unlock new features over time, including the combo mode for upper and lower sections.</p>
<p>The Govee uplighter floor lamp is an incredible value at $125 this Black Friday. This is Philips Hue-level smart lighting for a fraction of the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch-2000646557</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch.1361968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and they’re already discounted on Amazon. That’s unusual for brand-new Apple products which typically hold their full price for months after launch. Apple isn’t offering any discount on their website or in Apple Stores so Amazon is clearly absorbing the cost to drive Black Friday traffic: You’re saving $30 on earbuds that haven’t even been on shelves for a full month, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">and at $219 down from $249, this is the lowest price we’ve seen</a> and likely the best deal you’ll find on these new earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Next-Level Audio</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on AirPods Pro 3 <strong>removes up to twice as much unwanted noise as the previous generation</strong>. And airplane engines, office chatter, and city traffic just fade away so you can focus on your music or podcast. The new acoustic architecture delivers transformed bass response with detailed clarity across all frequencies. Vocals sound stunningly vivid, and you can pick out individual instruments in complex recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial audio immerses you in a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> where movies and music feel more real than ever. When you turn your head, the sound shifts around you, placing you in the heart of the action. Of course, this only works with compatible content on Apple Music, Apple TV+, and select other streaming services. It also extends to gaming, providing you with better spatial awareness so you know exactly where sounds are coming from.</p>



<p>These health features are genuinely groundbreaking for a product of this size. Integrated heart rate sensing keeps track of your pulse and calories burned across 50 different workout types. You get access to your Move ring, step count, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The hearing health suite includes a home hearing test and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost.</p>
<p>Live Translation is one of those features that sounds like science fiction until you try it. Firing on all cylinders thanks to Apple Intelligence, the feature translates conversations in real-time directly through your earbuds. You can communicate across language barriers during travel or international business meetings and <strong>the translation is local on your device for privacy and speed</strong>.</p>



<p>Battery life is significantly better compared to previous generations: You get up to <strong>8 hours of listening time with active noise cancellation enabled</strong> or up to 10 hours in Transparency mode using the Hearing Aid feature. The USB-C charging case provides additional charges when you’re on the go. A quick charge gives you hours of listening from just minutes in the case.</p>
<p>The <strong>new ear tips come in five sizes, up from the previous three</strong>, to provide a much more personalized and secure fit. A better seal means improved noise isolation and bass response sans cranking the volume up. The buds stay put during workouts, runs, and active daily use. Apple’s fit test in the Settings app will help you find the perfect size for your ears. Comfort matters when you are wearing earbuds for hours at a time.</p>
<p>At $219, the AirPods Pro 3 offer fantastic value on brand new Apple hardware. Amazon’s taking the hit on margins that Apple won’t match in their own stores. If you want the latest AirPods Pro at a price below retail, this record-low Black Friday deal is the opportunity to grab them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-shows-no-pride-v11-vacuum-cleaner-now-sells-cheaper-than-mid-range-generic-alternatives-2000646571</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson vacuums are known to be pricey, but they’ve also gained a reputation for being worth the price. One of Dyson’s most recent cordless models, <strong>the V11 Origin</strong>, packs serious suction and smart features into a lightweight design. There’s a reason this has been Dyson’s best-seller since Black Friday started on Thursday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">At $399, down from $629, you’re saving $230 on a premium cleaning machine</a> that will revolutionize the way you do housework. And, with this record-low price, Dyson quality is now accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction That Handles Every Surface</h2>
<p>The <strong>185 air watts of suction power places the V11 Origin</strong> among the most powerful cordless vacuums you can buy. This is a full 60% more power than previous Dyson generations, and you instantly tell the difference on carpets. Deep-embedded dirt, pet hair, and fine dust get pulled up from fibers that other vacuums leave behind. The same power works brilliantly on hard floors without scattering debris around.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head automatically<strong> adjusts to different floor types</strong> as you work your way through your house. Firm nylon bristles dig into carpets, while softer carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust on hard floors. The brilliant part is the de-tangling technology that stops long hair and pet hair from wrapping around the brush bar. You won’t spend time cutting hair out of the roller after every cleaning session.</p>



<p>Three power modes allow you to customize suction for what you’re cleaning. Auto mode intelligently adjusts the power as it senses different floor types and dirt levels. Eco mode makes the most of battery life for lighter cleaning tasks around the home. Boost mode unleashes full suction for stubborn messes and high-traffic areas. The <strong>LCD screen shows your current mode</strong>, remaining runtime down to the second and maintenance alerts.</p>
<p>It reaches up to <strong>60 minutes on a single charge in Eco mode</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to cover most homes. The removable lithium-ion battery charges in an included docking station that mounts on your wall. Having a dedicated home for the vacuum keeps it charged and ready whenever you need it. The accessories store neatly on the dock, too, so everything stays organized. Just grab, clean, and dock back in seconds.</p>



<p>Turn this floor vacuum into a portable cleaning machine <strong>with the handheld conversion</strong>. Pop off the wand and attach the various tools directly to the main unit: The crevice tool reaches into tight spaces, car seats, and between cushions. The mini soft dusting brush handles delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching. The hair screw tool tackles upholstery and stairs where pet hair tends to accumulate.</p>
<p><strong>At just 6.6 pounds</strong>, the V11 Origin feels manageable even during extended cleaning sessions. The weight balance keeps it comfortable to maneuver around furniture and up stairs. You can easily lift it to clean ceiling corners, curtains, and high shelves. The cordless freedom means no more unplugging and re-plugging as you move between rooms.</p>
<p>HEPA filtration captures allergens and microscopic particles that cheaper vacuums blow back into your air. This matters if anyone in your household deals with allergies or asthma. Whole-machine<strong> filtration traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>. You’re improving your indoor air quality while you clean your floors.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin offers unparalleled value at $399 this Black Friday and this is the best-selling Dyson vacuum for a reason.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Beats has been owned by Apple since 2014 but the brand has maintained its own identity and signature sound that fans love. The<strong> Beats Pill is one of the most iconic portable speakers</strong> ever made and it continues to deliver impressive audio in a compact package. This Black Friday, it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $149</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this legendary speaker, now is the time to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Seriously Loud Sound in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>audio quality on the Beats Pill punches far above its weight class</strong>. A custom acoustic architecture produces rich, balanced sound with deep bass that fills a room. You get that signature Beats warmth without any of the muddiness that tends to plague cheaper portable speakers. It gets genuinely very loud while remaining clear, so outdoor gatherings and beach days can sound great.</p>
<p>Where the Beats Pill really impresses is in its battery life: it <strong>gives you as much as 24 hours of playback</strong> from one charge, so weekend trips and all-day events are covered without having to hunt for an outlet. The USB-C charging keeps things simple since you’re probably already carrying that cable for your phone. A quick 10-minute charge gives you enough juice for a couple more hours when you’re running low.</p>



<p><strong>Water resistance adds durability</strong> that makes the Beats Pill ready for real-life adventures. Splashes by the pool, rain at a picnic, or spills at a party won’t damage this speaker. You can take it out to places where you wouldn’t want to take more fragile electronics. The build quality feels solid and premium in your hands without being heavy or awkward to carry. This is gear designed for people who actually use their speakers outside of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> works seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices. For the iPhone, one gets extra benefits, such as one tap pairing and Find My integration to locate the speaker in case it goes missing. Android users, on the other hand, get the same excellent sound quality and reliable wireless connection. Pairing only takes seconds, and the connection stays stable even when you move around. You can also connect two Beats Pills together for stereo sound or amplified mode when one speaker isn’t enough.</p>



<p>The compact design makes this speaker truly portable in a way larger Bluetooth speakers just aren’t. It fits in a backpack, beach bag, or even a large jacket pocket without weighing you down. The cylindrical shape looks clean and modern while<strong> providing 360-degree sound dispersion</strong>. The matte black finish resists fingerprints and looks sleek in any setting. You’ll actually want to bring this speaker with you rather than leaving it at home because it’s too bulky.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill, at $99, is a seriously good Black Friday value. At the record-low price, an already great speaker becomes an incredible deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch-2000646578</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch.1361950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google bought up Fitbit back in 2021 and the brand has been incrementally improving ever since. The <strong>Charge 6</strong> is Google’s direct challenge to Apple Watch in the fitness tracker space, albeit at a much friendlier price. This tracker packs serious health monitoring features including built-in GPS and Google app integration, into a slim wristband design. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/"> it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $159</a>. You also get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium included</strong>, adding even more value to an already great deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Google-Powered Fitness Tracking on Your Wrist</h2>
<p>The Google integration changes how you interact with your fitness tracker throughout the day. On walks and runs, Google Maps gives turn-by-turn directions right from your wrist. With Google Wallet, you’re able to make contactless payments without having to pull out your phone or card. And control from YouTube Music lets you manage your workout playlist sans breaking stride.</p>
<p>That makes heart rate monitoring on the Fitbit Charge 6 a game-changer for indoor workouts, especially with compatible gym equipment. Connect to Bluetooth-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes that can broadcast your heart rate. Your real-time pulse data appears on the machine’s display to help you stay in your target zone. Previously, this type of gym equipment compatibility had been limited to higher-end fitness watches. You get the premium features without the premium price tag.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS tracks your runs, cycling routes, and hikes</strong> accurately without needing your phone nearby. Afterwards, you can see your pace, distance, and elevation changes in the Fitbit app. The GPS locks in quickly, so you are not standing around waiting before your run.</p>
<p>Health monitoring goes deep on the Charge 6, with continuous heart rate tracking and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. Sleep tracking analyzes your rest patterns and provides a daily Sleep Score. Stress management tools include guided breathing sessions and an EDA sensor for mindfulness sessions. The tracker monitors your Active Zone Minutes, which count time spent in fat-burning or cardio heart rate zones.</p>



<p>The six-month Fitbit Premium membership that’s included with your purchase will unlock advanced insights and guided programs. With Premium, you get detailed sleep analysis, personalized workout recommendations, and mindfulness content. Video workouts from fitness experts give you fresh routines to try at home or in the gym. Health metrics dashboard shows trends in your data over time. <strong>This membership normally costs $10/month</strong>&nbsp;so you’re getting an additional $60 value included.</p>
<p>Battery life reaches<strong> up to seven days on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which beats most smartwatches by a wide margin. You can track an entire week of workouts, sleep, and daily activity without touching a charger. When you do need to recharge, it takes about two hours to reach full capacity. The <strong>always-on display option</strong> shows your stats at a glance without tapping or wrist-raising. Less time charging means more time tracking.</p>
<p>The slim band design keeps the Charge 6 comfortable for all-day and all-night wear: <strong>Both small and large bands come in the box</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll find the right fit immediately. Water resistance up to 50 meters means showers, swimming, and sweaty workouts won’t damage the tracker. The<strong> touchscreen is quick to respond</strong> and easy to navigate through menus. You get a premium feel without the bulk of a traditional smartwatch.</p>
<p>At $99, the Fitbit Charge 6 is an absolute steal this Black Friday. This is the best fitness tracker from Google and Fitbit at nearly 40% off retail.</p>

            <p>
Gosh, can you believe it? It's already the 35th anniversary of Ruin! It came out before I was born, but even I'm feeling the passage of time with this one. With such a momentous occasion upon us, a special 35th anniversary edition of the legendary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has been released by its developer Official Electric, split across just four floppy disks… except, well, you've definitely already clocked that Ruin isn't quite real. At least not in the way it's been presented.
</p>
<p>
The actual game in question here is Ruin: Chapter 0, an interactive fiction game in the stylings of something you might have seen on the ZX Spectrum, albeit with a lot more flair. And, perhaps, a lot more glitches - <strong>a big flashing imagery warning is needed for this one</strong>. Playable within your browser, it's kind of hard to describe what you do, or even what you're doing, in Ruin. From what I can gather, you are a knight, the hero of rune, tasked by the king to retrieve a sword and defeat evil forever. But no matter what, I just keep getting my ass kicked by this evil, and every time I die it just says "get owned" at me! Rude!
</p>

<p>
And then the game becomes something else… a sci-fi romper across different planets, one where you run through the woods clicking on apples at just the right time as they approach you, and where you take pitstops to take a smoke break. Those moments where you take the devil sticks out of their luxurious boxes requires you to actually do so, dragging it out, flicking your lighter to set it off, pulling it towards your lips. It is such a strangely involved game in some ways, and hands-off in others.
</p><p>
It flicks between your more typical RPG kind of screen, to a first-person point-and-click adventure game, to, quite honestly, an animated movie of sorts. There is an impenetrable quality to it that makes me want to break it down, to uncover its secrets, to do a deep dive on Wikipedia followed by watching several "Ruin EXPLAINED" videos on YouTube. And yet I won't find those, because Ruin is not the legendary IP celebrating its 35th anniversary it claims to be. But it does a good job of making you believe in it.

              <p>Gamers who also create content, edit videos, or work long hours at their desk need a mouse that handles everything. Your gaming mouse might be great for fragging but it’s probably not ideal for those 10-hour editing sessions or browsing between matches. The <strong>Logitech MX Master 3S</strong> bridges that gap with an 8K DPI sensor, ergonomic design and features that make productivity feel effortless. This Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/">it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $119</a>. If you want one mouse that dominates both work and play, this is the one to grab.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision and Comfort Built for Marathon Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>8000 DPI sensor</strong> inside the MX Master 3S tracks on virtually any surface, including glass. You can game on your desk, work from a coffee shop table or use it on your couch armrest with no need for a mousepad. Whichever you choose, the tracking remains accurate and responsive. Sensitivity is fully customizable through the <em>Logi Options+</em> software, so you can really dial in just the feel you want.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of this mouse are really impressive for long sessions of gaming and work: The <strong>sculpted shape fits naturally in your hand</strong>&nbsp;and reduces strain through those marathon streams or nights of editing. Your wrist and fingers stay comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The thumb rest provides support that cheaper mice simply don’t offer. If you have ever felt hand fatigue after extended time at the desk, this design makes a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>The <em>Quiet Clicks</em> feature cuts down the noise by 90% compared to the regular mice and becomes a game-changer in streamers’ and content developers’ lives. Your microphone will not catch any kind of annoying click sound while recording or on Discord with your buddies. They are still satisfying and tactile clicks, just without the audible snap.</p>
<p><em>MagSpeed</em> scrolling is one of those features you don’t know you need until you experience it. The scroll wheel moves with electromagnetic precision, allowing you to scroll through long documents or web pages in a single flick. It’s <strong>90% faster and 87% more precise than conventional scroll wheels</strong>. When you need fine control, it shifts automatically to a ratcheted mode that clicks through line by line.</p>



<p>Multi-device connectivity allows you to <strong>connect the MX Master 3S to up to three computers or devices at once</strong>. Switch between your gaming rig, work laptop, and tablet with the press of a button. Flow takes this a step further by allowing you to move your cursor seamlessly across computers and drag files across them. This is incredible if one runs a dual-system setup for streaming and gaming. The <strong>mouse connects via Bluetooth</strong> or the included Logi Bolt USB receiver for a great wireless connection.</p>
<p>And the battery life won’t leave you stranded mid-session: <strong>a full charge lasts up to 70 days of regular use</strong> and a quick one-minute charge gives you three hours of power when you’re in a pinch. The USB-C charging port also means you can use the same cable as your phone or controller.</p>
<p>The Logitech MX Master 3S is an unbelievable deal at $99 this Black Friday, make sure you don’t miss that opportunity.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-debunk-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-not-releasing-in-2026-claim-insiders.1361932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After an earlier claim—or belief, depending on how you want to look at it—stating otherwise, some insiders have started to say that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not coming out in 2026. In addition, it won’t be in attendance at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>.</p>



<p>Last year at The Game Awards, Naughty Dog revealed its next title,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. The sci-fi set space fantasy looked way different than previous studio titles, minus some familiar faces. Hype for the title has been palpable, so when former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty appeared to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim the game</a> would release in 2026, many were excited. However, it seems it would be short-lived, as credible insiders have come to debunk the report, including Moriarty himself.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-at-the-game-awards-2025-insiders-state">No Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet at The Game Awards 2025, Insiders State</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I sympathize with being misquoted. He was speculating and people on the internet pretended he wasn't. Either way, this caused people to confirm to me it won't be out in 2026 and it won't be at TGAs. </p><p>I'm not interested in keeping score on who said what right on a podcast.</p></div>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>After Colin Moriarty’s comments went viral, some insiders <strong>quickly hopped onto social media</strong> to <strong>debunk the report of Intergalactic releasing in 2026</strong>. The first to do so was <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, a notable name in the gaming industry. Commenting on a /GamingLeaksandRumours post, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1p3zwoe/comment/nq8f5f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he states</a>, “<strong>Can assure you that Intergalactic is not coming out in 2026.</strong>“</p>



<p>Then, video game journalist and insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1992351916517683631?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Twitter</a> that not only would Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet <strong>not come out in 2026</strong>, but <strong>it won’t be at The Game Awards this year</strong>. Following suit, Colin Moriarty <a href="https://x.com/longislandviper/status/1992340284026331442">commented on social media</a> that his words, used in the report, <strong>were taken out of context</strong> and that <strong>it was his opinion</strong>.</p>



<p>Either way, it does look like Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet will be quite a while away. Neil Druckmann himself, who is directing the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-fans-see-more-of-intergalactic-neil-druckmann-wont-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">couldn’t confirm</a> when we’d see the title again. It will be interesting to see when more will come out, though it’ll be exciting to watch gameplay. Naughty Dog’s track record is rather solid, so, whatever year it does launch, it’ll be one to watch out for.</p>







<p>Are you disappointed to hear Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet not coming out in 2026? Still hoping to see it at The Game Awards? When do you think it’ll come out? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <p>
Let's get something real clear here right off the bat: I couldn't possibly tell you if Team Cherry are planning to make any more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> games. That isn't to say there isn't more Hollow Knight on the way, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be getting… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-will-get-dlc-for-years-some-of-the-plans-for-that-stuff-are-kind-of-ambitious-as-well">something</a>, at some point, in the future. However! Studio heads William Pellen and Ari Gibson have at least floated a hypothetical idea around how the world of Hollow Knight might get bigger.
</p>
<p>
Remember when ACMI (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) put on a little exhibition <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">where there was a playable demo for Silksong</a> earlier this year? Well, as shared by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar</a>, that same exhibition came with a <a href="https://shop.acmi.net.au/collections/frontpage/products/acmi-guide-hollow-knight-silk-song-softcover">little guidebook</a> filled with concept art, maps, as well as an interview with Team Cherry.
</p>
<p>
Pellen and Gibson were asked by co-curator of the exhibition Jini Maxwell how they might define success for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, both noting that "releasing it with no major bugs" would be a good start. "The 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," Pellen explained. "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."
</p>
<p>
Gibson added on to that saying that said goal was to make Silksong a "game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight," one that "kind of branches off in a nice way; I think they really complement each other." Here's where the interesting bit comes in from Gibson: "I don't think you'd feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong. And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern - that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."
</p><p>
Ahah! There it is! The quote that will convince the masses that more Hollow Knight games are in the works. Of course, again, there's no way of knowing this. Still, this comment reassures me. I'm glad that Silksong is mostly a self-contained experience separate from the original Hollow Knight, and if this world has to be explored again, it should once more do its own thing. Wouldn't mind it if Sherma showed up elsewhere, though.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-black-friday-2025-best-games-backwards-compatible-2000646545</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-great-xbox-360-classics-are-all-super-cheap-right-now.1361902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of my favorite things to do on my Xbox Series S is occasionally trawl the digital storefront archives for <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-360-5878837">my favorite Xbox 360 games</a>. Often they aren’t available or are ridiculously expensive compared to their bargain bin physical versions. But very occasionally they’re available through Microsoft’s backwards compatibility program and only cost less than $10. Today is one of those days.</p> <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday 2025 sale</a> this year happens to coincide with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286">the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360</a>. As a result, you can pick up some of the retro console’s best games for just the cost of a cup of coffee or Big Mac:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong></em> – $2.25 (normally $15)</li> <li><strong><em>Blue Dragon</em></strong> – $5 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Lost Odyssey</em></strong> – $8.25 (normally $25)</li> <li><strong><em>Alan Wake</em></strong> – $6 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fable II</em></strong> – $6.60 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 2</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 3</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></strong> – $7 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fallout 3</em></strong> – $2.50 (normally $10)</li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter IV</strong></em> – $4 (normally $20)</li> </ul> <p>If you played <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> this year and loved it, do yourself a favor and pick up <em>Lost Odyssey</em>. The cult-classic turn-based RPG was developed by <em>Final Fantasy</em> veterans including Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu and has an emotional bombshell for a narrative arc.</p>

 <p>“For me, Lost Odyssey was the last grand turn-based RPG adventure with realistic graphics,” <em>Clair Obscur</em> director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a> earlier this year. “Its themes were very heavy and very well handled. It’s the last game that made me cry.”</p>

 <p><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, meanwhile, is a great sci-fi immersive sim with incredible art direction that never got ported. <em>Street Fighter IV</em> might be the best entry in the series ever. And if you don’t want to wait for that rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster to appear, you can revisit the Washington D.C. wasteland today for steal.</p> <p>And if you recent played through the original Gears story by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106">this summer’s<em> Reloaded Edition</em></a>, you can find a local co-op buddy and complete the journey this Thanksgiving break. Rip to some real ones.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite family holiday traditions is gathering around a good jigsaw puzzle. It's one of the few activities that draws in people of all ages to work on the same activity. Every year we break out a new puzzle and just slowly work on it throughout the day together. It's relaxing, fun, and you end up with a feeling of accomplishment when you finally place that last piece. It's my turn to bring a puzzle to the family gathering this year, and luckily, Amazon is discounting a ton of puzzles from Ravensburger right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ravensburger is one of the best jigsaw puzzle brands available and one of the few I always look to buy when there's a sale. The collection of Christmas-themed puzzles I've highlighted below are especially good for the holidays, but you can check out the full sale for more options.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ravensburger Jigsaw Puzzle Sale at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost all of the puzzles in this sale are considered Amazon Lightning deals. That means there is a limit to how much stock is available at the discount listed for each item. So the more popular a puzzle is, the more likely it is to have the discount fully claimed before time runs out on the sale. After covering these sales a few times, however, I've found that the "limit" on the discount is only ever reached on the most popular puzzles. And since these discounts are all part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-sale-2025-early-deals">Amazon's official Black Friday sale</a>, it's likely that the deals will last beyond the limit if people are buying enough of them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Tips for Buying Jigsaw Puzzles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Buying any size puzzle is a commitment. It's one that you can easily just put on a shelf and forget about, but actually starting and finishing it takes time. Unless you are a world champion puzzler, it's going to take you more than one day to put one together unless it's less than 100 pieces or you have many people helping you out.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you have enough space</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing you should consider before buying a puzzle is whether or not you have a place to put it together. Given that many popular puzzles are 500-1,000 pieces, it can be hard to keep track of all of them at any given time. You'll need ample space to both sort through and organize pieces and be able to leave or store it and come back to it later. If you don't already have a table that is ideal for puzzling, there are quite a few <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">puzzle boards and tables</a> you can buy to remedy that. There are also jigsaw puzzle mats to roll up your puzzle and put it away without undoing all of your progress. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great puzzle gifts</a> and I'd highly recommend them to any puzzle fanatic.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Make sure you actually like the puzzle's image</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the more obvious tip for buying any sort of puzzle is to make sure you actually like the image you're putting together before you make a purchase. A lot of puzzles feature a ton of tiny intricate details to keep you interested as you put it together, but some feature large swaths of single colors that could get tedious to put together. If you're already investing a bunch of your time into a puzzle, pick something that you'll be happy to see when finished, even for just a moment in time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Invest in some puzzle glue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">While most people put together puzzles just for the enjoyment of it all, it can also be fun to display the finished product once you're done. This is especially true if the puzzle is depicting a work of art, rather than just a photograph. It is, after all, a cardboard poster that you've put together yourself. If you plan on displaying your puzzle after you finish, you'll want to get yourself some puzzle glue to ensure the finished product actually stays together when you frame it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-is-slashing-prices-on-ravensburger-christmas-jigsaw-puzzles-for-black-friday-2025]]></content:encoded>

		<p>I certainly wasn’t expecting to have been raining in Las Vegas when I belatedly got up and turned on the replay of the Formula 1 qualifying.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve might have <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the new Steam Frame for early 2026, but if you want a new Virtual Reality headset this Holiday season, the PlayStation VR2 is still a great choice. It's already discounted ahead of Black Friday 2025, too: <a href="https://amzn.to/48wab8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon offers it at $299, 25% off the regular price of $399</a>.</p>



<p>This is the bundle that also includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-coming-to-psvr2-with-new-main-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, the flagship launch title developed specifically for PlayStation VR2 by Guerrilla Games and Firesprite. The game is a spin-off of the popular open world action/adventure series Horizon, though it differs from the main installments in that the protagonist is Ryas, a former Shadow Carja rebel, in perspective, which is first-person only to accommodate the needs of a Virtual Reality game, and in being a lot more linear.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the PlayStation VR2 is no longer limited to the PlayStation 5 console and can also be used with a PC, provided you're willing to purchase the PC adapter, <a href="https://fave.co/3KjBPg7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">priced at $59.99 from the official PlayStation Direct store</a>. A DisplayPort 1.4 cable is also required; however, if you are an existing VR user, you likely already have one. You will then download the PlayStation VR2 app <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, unlocking compatibility with thousands of PC games for the headset.</p>



<p>If you instead choose to stick with PS5 VR-compatible games, here's a list of some of the best games:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pqX12M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Village - $23.94</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Mhe7Sg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 4 - $17.93</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3LU5yNc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gran Turismo 7 - $29.99</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4rnSQqn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No Man's Sky - $22.48</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48iMUWT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Behemoth - $27.78</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4a8Ie8o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossfire: Sierra Squad - $29.90</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pwcjn4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADiSON VR - $28.99</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/48ADh6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vertigo 2 - $44.95</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/4pxzzkB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge Enhanced Edition - $50.87</a></li>



<li><a href="https://amzn.to/488jbje" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Nights at Freddy's Help Wanted 2 - $18.78</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying the PlayStation VR2 or not, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the product</a> by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>



<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade 2 Going Multiplatform]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-2-going-multiplatform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-2-going-multiplatform.1361851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new recruitment post, Shift Up is planning to make Stellar Blade 2 multiplatform. Furthermore, it may hint at Stellar Blade coming to Xbox and Nintendo.</p>







<p>If you haven’t played Stellar Blade, you’ve definitely heard of it. Releasing in 2024, the Korean-made title by Shift Up made headlines for its insane graphics and action gameplay. Despite controversy regarding its protagonist, Eve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-not-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stirred in all stages</a> of development, the game was a huge success, critically and fan-wise. It was nominated for several awards, including some Game Awards, especially for its soundtrack. Due to huge positivity, the company was quick to say more is on the way, even going so far as to say <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-sequel-in-development-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before 2027</a>. Now, a new development has been revealed, and it’s one that bodes well for the sequel’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-2-coming-to-various-platforms-says-shift-up">Stellar Blade 2 Coming to ‘Various Platforms’, Says Shift Up</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The news comes from <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/news/news.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=318&amp;page=1&amp;code=news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recruitment post</a> on Shift Up’s official Korean website. In it, the studio states that it is looking to build out its team for Stellar Blade 2. The title, said to be currently in development, plans to bring the epic action fans loved from the original for next-gen. On that note, Shift Up is aiming to have Stellar Blade 2 launch be multiplatform, expanding to other consoles and PC. </p>



<p>Interestingly enough, the original Stellar Blade was a PlayStation 5 exclusive, only seeing a PC release earlier this year. As of now, no port of the title has been announced for Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. One has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-could-come-to-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored for a bit</a>, though nothing concrete has been said yet. With Stellar Blade 2 now multiplatform, perhaps this means we could see Stellar Blade break exclusivity and go to Xbox and Nintendo soon.</p>







<p>What do you think of Stellar Blade 2 going multiplatform? When do you think Stellar Blade will go to other consoles? Think it’ll release on Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

While it’s a shame that the decades-old console’s marketplace is gone, it doesn’t take away from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">Xbox 360’s legacy as a popular, innovative, and weird machine</a> that paved the way for the current era of gaming.</p> <p>For better and for worse, when Microsoft’s Xbox 360 launched in 2005 it changed video games forever.

		<p>Bethesda has revealed the details for the Fallout 4 November patch, which adds a brand new Varmint Rifle and fixes for various issues causing crashes. However, the November patch will not bring the mod storage expansion for consoles as planned. But, console players need to be aware that when this update is released in December it will reset the mod load order, so action needs to be taken.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3zKeAbOFFeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you are playing Fallout 4 on consoles and using mods, these are the steps to take to make sure your load order is not impacted.</p>

<li><em>At the bottom of the Load Order Menu screen, select “Load Order Archive.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Save Load Order to Bethesda.net.”</em></li>
<li><em>Select “Yes” to confirm.</em></li>
<li><em>You should receive a message confirming the current load order has been saved to Bethesda.net</em></li>
<li><em>Exit the menu and allow the game to reload your data files. The game will confirm your load order has changed, indicating the process is complete!</em></li>
</ol>
<p>And here are the Fallout 4 November patch notes:</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-release-report/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is releasing sometime in 2026. Even more so, information may be revealed at this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Awards</a> in December.</p>







<p>When it comes to storytelling, no studio does it better than Naughty Dog. From the adventurous Uncharted series to the excellent The Last of Us titles, it has yet to really miss. At The Game Awards 2024, the studio unveiled its next title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Sporting an all-star cast led by Uncharted’s Tati Gabrielle, the title looks to go outside the studio’s grounded work and go out of this world, literally. While not much is known outside of a CGI trailer, it seems we won’t have to wait long to know more, if the report from a YouTuber is correct.</p>



<p>UPDATE: After this article was published, several insiders debunked the 2026 report. Furthermore, Colin Moriarty stated that his words were taken out of context and were speculation on his end. Our link to the new story can be found <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-2026-debunk-claim/">here</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a podcast with Dan Allen Gaming, former gaming journalist Colin Moriarty spoke on a matter of topics. One game in particular that came into focus was Naughty Dog’s Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. The clip in question comes around the <a href="https://youtu.be/oKkiw9KpgKA?si=YsxaBuDLpL-oqeWx&amp;t=4187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">1:09:47</a> mark. Speaking on the game, Colin states,</p>



<p>“<strong>I believe we’ll see it at The Game Awards, I think next year it’ll be good to go</strong>,” states Moriarty. “<strong>Maybe they [Naughty Dog] will delay it, but based on the way they’re hiring and also things I’m hearing about people interacting with the game, and they’re also hiring for localization now, they’re getting into the end, and it’s a sign that everything is kinda locked down and content complete. I won’t be surprised if it was out this time next year.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony or Naughty Dog have not confirmed when Intergalactic will release, so take the news with a grain of salt. That said, Naughty Dog has been working on The Heretic Prophet since 2020, so it won’t be surprising to see more before the year’s end. It would be coming out in a packed year, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-gta6-fall-2026-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> releasing, but the studio can hold it’s own. Funnily enough, the original Last of Us came out when Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, so it would be a neat coincidence for the two to battle it out for Game of the Year.</p>

            <p>
I think miHoYo might just have a bit too much money. Somehow, they have yet another game on the way called Varsapura, yet another anime-looking, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open-world</a> action game, this time by way of psychic mishappenings. As many have pointed out, there's a vague Control-like quality to it, at least in its newly shown off, lengthy gameplay demo.
</p>
<p>
The atmosphere and vibes are admittedly quite strong, miHoYo has always been fairly good at that. Within the gameplay demo, a fancy, government-esque building twists and reshapes itself into something surreal and abstract, enemies that look like office workers turned into shadowy monsters.

<p>
Narratively, this is all explained thusly: the titular Varsapura is a strange space that can be entered, with the protagonist's appearance shifting "to match each viewer’s preferences. The origin of this parapsychological effect remains unknown." There's an organisation called SEAL, or Shadow Emergency Alliance, with the player character showing up at their main office (the aforementioned government building), in a particularly Control-like intro.
</p><p>
Then there's the combat, which honestly, once you've played one miHoYo game you've played them all. It's all flashily animated combos that let you switch between different characters with what appears to be not much substance. Don't get me wrong, fun to look at, there's just a similar aura to those videos of singing bits of fruit and vegetables that are rotting babies' brains. Also I wish they'd let the psychic cop women wear pants, it doesn't seem like the kind of work they're doing really calls for a miniskirt.
</p>
<p>
Overall there's still not much known about Varsapura, outside of the fact it's releasing on PC. You'll just have to keep an eye out on a release date in the meantime.

            <p>Remedy has delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>'s Rogue Protocol update to January 2026, reporting it "still needs a bit more time".</p>
<p>While the long-requested feature, cross-platform voice chat, has rolled out as planned this week, Remedy's larger Rogue Protocol update has slipped to an unspecified date in January, taking the new mode Endless Shift with it.</p>

<p>The team <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/621061415005848720?l=english">said</a> the extra time "will help us make sure everything feels right: polished, balanced, and worthy of your time", and to ease the pain of the delay, it has shared some more details about the new wave-based survival mode.</p><p>"Each Endless Shift drops you and your team into a sealed arena where waves of enemies grow tougher with every round," the update explains. "You always start with only the bare essentials to fight with. After each wave, you’ll collect Corruption, a strange residue left behind by defeated enemies. This energy can be spent between rounds to unlock powerful upgrades, weapons, and enhancements, letting you shape a completely new build every run."</p>
<p>When it does arrive, Rogue Protocol will be Firebreak's second big content drop since September's Breakpoint update, wherein Remedy admitted it had "taken a lot of feedback to heart" and had worked over the summer to bring "significant improvements and new systems, as well as content, into the game".</p>
<p>Last month we learned that FBC: Firebreak, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">has still not reached the studio's internal targets</a> "despite improved player and sales metrics after the update". Remedy issued a profit warning to investors as it lowered projected operating profits "due to weak sales of FBC: Firebreak", claiming the missed target had "a substantial impact" on the studio's finances and revising its forecast downwards. It now expects operating profit to be "negative and below the previous year".</p>
<p>Ten days after that financial report,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-change-at-alan-wake-studio-remedy-as-ceo-steps-down-following-failure-of-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak"> Remedy Entertainment CEO Tero Virtala stepped down from his position at the Alan Wake studio with immediate effect</a>.</p>

              <p>You have an Xbox 360 controller waiting for you in your living room and a console hungry to entertain you. It’s an older console, sure. But it still has a ton of great games.</p> <p><em>This list was published on April 21, 2016. We’re re-posting it today in honor of the Xbox 360’s 20th anniversary.</em></p> <p>As of April 2016, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ends-xbox-360-production-1772042864">Microsoft has ceased production of the Xbox 360 console</a>. It had a great run—red rings and Kinect 1.0 notwithstanding—and it got a ton of great games. These dozen games have occupied our Bests list for a long while, and at this point there’ll probably never be another update. (Never say never, though!)</p>

 <p>Here are our recommendations for the 12 best games on Xbox 360. Enjoy.</p> <h2 data-textannotation-id="9201ab5b178b5c0b91005e103f75f309"><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646524">Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p>After years of changes both minor and major, the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> series had begun to feel in a rut. (For example: We’d had <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> on this list since its inception.) Finally this year, with the pirate-themed <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, the series has taken a major and unequivocal step forward. It doesn’t lose <em>all</em> of the series’ bad habits—hello follow missions—but it improves many longstanding problems with better stealth, easier-to-navigate cities, and sidequests that actually feel like they help make your character more powerful. Best of all, it adds naval combat and a vast Caribbean overworld that make the game feel like, in the words of Luke Plunkett, “<em>Wind Waker</em> for grown-ups.”</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>Pirate fans, history buffs, anyone who’s ever wanted to pull up alongside a British frigate, grab a rope and swing from one deck to the other before fighting your way up the deck to take on the captain. So basically, anyone who’s ever wanted to be a pirate.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those who demand precision controls. The on-foot controls in <em>Black Flag</em> are probably the best of the series, but they’re still a far cry from where a third-person stealth/platformer should be. It’s time for a crouch button, Ubisoft.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/17WsnAu" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646525">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>With an even bigger, wackier, lootier <em>Borderlands</em>, Gearbox has proved that their hybrid RPG/shooter franchise isn’t just a one-hit wonder. Three years after the first release, Gearbox put out a <em>Borderlands 2</em> that doesn’t just have thousands more guns. It’s more complex. It’s even got <em>heart</em>. And yet <em>Borderlands 2</em> still manages to strike a balance between being more soulful while retaining the slapstick, make-no-excuses-for-itself humor for which the series is known. The characters you meet are often borderline (if not full-blown) psychotic, but in the most endearing of ways. Enemies are just as raunchy as they are diverse. It’s colorful, it’s tough, it’s meaty, and it’s a joy to play with up to 3 friends in co-op. It’s also got TONS of extra, downloadable content to keep you busy once you finish the main game.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Gamers who want a fun co-op experience to play through with friends. There are plenty of quests, plenty of guns, and plenty of laughs to be had.</p> <p><strong>Not A Good Match For</strong>: People who want to burn through a game easily. <em>Borderlands 2</em> can be pretty tough, especially without backup. And if you aren’t willing to spend some time churning out sidequests, you just might catch yourself at the tail-end of the game without the chops or stats to finish without getting burnt out.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xf2Cr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Burnout: Paradise</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646526">Criterion Games</figcaption></figure> <p>Automotive destruction’s never looked as sexy as it does in Criterion’s hi-speed racing game <em>Burnout: Paradise</em>. You’re tasked with driving against traffic, scraping against civilian cars and shoving competitors into signature crashes called Takedowns. But, <em>Paradise</em> also deserves praise for a seamless integration of multiplayer where dropping into a showdown can be quick as tapping a button.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Street racing fans. If you’ve ever pulled up to a stoplight and imagined what it’d be like to burn rubber on a wide-open stretch of asphalt—and survive any ensuing mishaps—this is your game.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> To tune the specs of their rides. It may be <em>Paradise</em> but these aren’t real-world cars. You can’t do much more than swap out paint jobs, so those wanting to make changes to brakes, shock or engines will need to get their grease-monkey fix elsewhere.</p>

 <p><b><a href="https://kotaku.com/burnout-paradise-didnt-need-a-remaster-but-its-nice-1823840738">Read</a> our review.</b></p> <h2><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646527">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> is an impressive crime game. Not perfect, but impressive. The game gives players one of the richest, most beautiful open worlds we’ve ever been able to play in. In this case, the landscape is a fictionalized version of Los Angeles and the California desert. Go anywhere in this vast game. Grab a car, plane, truck, bicycle, boat or tank. Head off in any direction. You’re bound to see extraordinary sights and stumble into some sort of good and probably violent time. The game looks amazing even on the old Xbox 360 hardware. It also plays better than any <em>GTA</em> before it. <em>GTA V</em>’s innovative, swappable three-protagonist system creates the feel of a true ensemble adventure, though crazy man Trevor steals the show.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Players who like to go into a game to break the rules. GTA is still at its best when it’s a playground for virtual misbehavior.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who can’t stomach the game’s mockery of, well, pretty much everyone.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1aLDtf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646528">Starbreeze Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> came out of nowhere this year, surprising everyone with its strange control scheme, smart (if simple) puzzles and devastating ending. Can game mechanics be emotionally affecting? Turns out yup, they can be. It’s a nice, short game with almost no fat—and despite the fact that the two main characters don’t communicate in a language anyone could understand, they still manage to communicate a great deal of context and backstory. You’ll never think of your thumbs and your controller triggers the same way.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For: </strong>People looking for something different, those who like weird controls schemes, fans of old-school fairy tales.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For: </strong>Those hoping for a long game—it’s a few hours long and offers no real replayability—people who like their characters to speak actual languages.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/18xsbsi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our thoughts</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646529">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p>Bethesda Softworks’ hit role-playing game does nothing so much as deliver a giant, Tolkien-styled possibility space to its players. The high-altitude climes of Tamriel feel alive with wonder and threat. The ability to customize your warrior outcast with a singular mix of mystical skills and melee mastery feels as broad as <em>Skyrim</em>’s horizon.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dungeon &amp; Dragon players. Adventuring in <em>Skyrim</em> feels like spinning your own epic yarn, as songs of your feats spread digitally from town to town in a game world that reacts to your actions. You can spend weeks meandering in its fascinating sidequests, leaving the main story.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who play with urgency. The drive to wander and discover overpowers the drive to complete in <em>Skyrim</em>. If you’re the kind of player who wants those two vectors to meet in a meaningful way, you’ll find <em>The Elder Scrolls V</em> a bit frustrating.</p>

 <p><a href="http://bit.ly/1cdDyGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Gears of War 3</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646530">Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Gears 3</em> fills the marquee spot held by Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> games and with good reason. Epic Games’ scifi shooter threequel represents hardcore shooter nirvana: a tightly-polished campaign that plays great solo or coop and some of the best multiplayer found anywhere. Moreover, the game’s been robustly supported with both campaign and multiplayer DLC designed to deepen an already hearty release, particularly with the addition of many of the best maps from <em>Gears of War 2</em></p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Dedicated online shooter fanatics who play every day. The more you play, the more <em>Gears 3</em> rewards you.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want deep character development or intriguing story structure. Gears games have always been meat-and-potatoes in terms of plot</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194lQIl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Halo: Reach</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646531">Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p>Bungie created the best goodbye possible with a “final” <em>Halo</em> title that both looks forward and backward in the blockbuster FPS franchise’s history. Pairing up a health system similar to that of the first <em>Halo</em> game with all-new abilities like jetpacks and holographic decoys makes the decade-old series feel simultaneously familiar and fresh.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Sci-fi fans. To play a <em>Halo</em> game is to be introduced to an expansive fictional universe. <em>Reach</em> places you inside one of the <em>Halo</em>-verse’s pivotal battles and imbues its lead characters and environments with more personality than in previous games.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Anyone who wants Master Chief. The Spartan you control in <em>Halo: Reach</em> isn’t as invulnerable or powerful as the Xbox mascot and the feel of certain weapons gets tweaked when compared to previous games.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/194m1Dv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Mass Effect 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646533">BioWare</figcaption></figure>  <p><em>Mass Effect 2</em> was the one that made you believe. Its predecessor drew players in with expansive world-building and a tense storyline, but it was also a clunky, rough-hewn slab of a game. BioWare’s 2010 follow-up polished the combat, introduced characters who’d become fan favorites and streamlined the overall experience to a fine focus. The first game made you want to experience all the sci-fi action and drama, but the second game made it a lot easier to do so. Pack in a huge number of varied and often terrific downloadable content packs and you’ve got one beefy, galaxy-spanning chunk of video game to play.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Fans of the <em>Star Wars</em> Expanded Universe. Like George Lucas’ signature creation, <em>Mass Effect</em>’s fictional cosmos has multitudes of tales to tell. The extremely good post-campaign DLC chapters expose players to side stories centered on both new and familiar characters, just like Timothy Zahn’s Thrawn Trilogy and the other <em>Star Wars</em> extensions. <em>Overlord</em>, <em>Lair of the Shadow Broker</em> and the other add-ons really made it feel like millions of little lives were at stake in Shepard’s fight against the Reapers.</p>

 <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> People who need closure. <em>Mass Effect 2</em> tells plenty of small stories, but the main narrative arc is still essentially a set-up for the 2012 follow-up.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bit.ly/1bSg7rz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646534">Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, the most assured work by the makers of the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> games finds its success by shedding the trappings of the modern-day world and giving players a vast virtual Southwest to roam in search of revenge. When your lonely ambles suddenly get shattered by an ambush or the plea to stop an unjust hanging, it’s a bittersweet adrenaline rush unlike anything else in modern video games. Silence, then gunfire, then more fleeting silence again.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Admirers of killer endings. The denouement for the turn-of-the-century saga stands as an emotionally powerful finish that can stand amongst the cowboy cinema that inspired it.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Fans of brevity. Redemption’s plot takes a long amount of playtime to resolve and you’ll often feel like you’re doing busy work in the nooks and crannies of its spaghetti Western game world.</p>

Valve’s follow-up to a classic improves on the humor, characterization and puzzle-solving of its predecessor to deliver a tight, focused experience full of poignancy and humor.</p> <p><strong>A Good Match for:</strong> Comedy lovers. The voicework alone—performed in stellar fashion by Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain—will make you laugh out loud but the brain-teasing puzzles and embedded gags keep the chuckles coming even when everything else in the game goes quiet.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Mediocrity fans. People who argue with <em>Portal 2</em>‘s greatness are like folks complaining that diamonds came from dirt. Their argument is invalid.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/19mLgNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review.</strong></p> <h2><em>XCOM: Enemy Within</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000646536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000646536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000646536">Firaxis</figcaption></figure> <p>There it is: proof that a multiplatform game released in 2012 can recapture the glories of a 1994 PC classic. The re-imagined <em>XCOM</em> delivers graphical upgrades and interface refinements like you might expect but what really makes it sing is the added attachment that you feel to the battles and the soldiers who fight them. If you’re considering picking up the game now, get <em>Enemy Within</em> instead, as it contains the original game as well as the terrific 2013 expansion. It’s sold as a standalone for consoles, so be sure to buy the new version.</p>

 <p><strong>A Good Match For:</strong> Efficiency lovers. This version of human-vs-aliens warfare streamlines gameplay when compared to its predecessor. And the importance of cover in combat and clever deployment of perks makes you consider every decision intensely.</p> <p><strong>Not a Good Match For:</strong> Those who want skirmishes. The combat in 2012 <em>XCOM</em> can stretch on way longer than is necessary. Because the battles require active engagement, you can feel chained to a session.</p> <p><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUJq0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read</strong></a><strong> our review and our review of </strong><a href="http://bit.ly/ISUN9d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the latest expansion.</strong></a></p> <p><em><strong>How has this list changed?

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a bit of a rough go of it, given how it's been in the works for a decade, still isn't finished, and was unceremoniously cancelled. Not to worry though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">as it's back</a>! And it's in the hands of its developer's original co-founders. With the announcement that Hytale will live on, it was also noted that the game's pricing would be revealed soon, and soon it was as it's already been confirmed.
</p>
<p>
As shared on Hytale's own Sitter account, the game will be a simple $20, with the option to pay a bit more if you fancy helping out the devs that little bit extra. There's two higher tiers, the first being Supporter at $35, and the Cursebreaker Founders Pack at $70, both of which will include cosmetics like "capes, hats, and more." Now, admittedly you might be thinking that $20 sounds quite low, something Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme agrees with.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">If you wish to support the team and Hytale’s development, we will be offering a Supporter and Founders pack that offers cosmetics like capes, hats, and more. <a href="https://t.co/K5q909tixp">pic.twitter.com/K5q909tixp</a></p>— Hytale (@Hytale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hytale/status/1991884608770855233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
"I’m pricing Hytale as aggressively low as possible," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1991889170189496781">wrote on his own Witter account</a>. "I’m taking on a considerable personal risk after repurchasing the game and getting it ready for early access for a growing team of now 50 talented individuals. I said I was all in, and I am delivering on that promise."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note that because the game is currently unfinished and is running on a build that's four years old, pricing it any higher wouldn't have felt right. He even went as far as saying that he doesn't "think the game is good yet." In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1992193367417971115">follow-up post</a> he doubled down on this saying he "genuinely" means it.
</p><p>
He explained that he's "confident it's going to be 'ok' for release," but a mixture of bug issues, a lack of progression mechanics configured, and generally missing features means it won't be as good as it could be. But he did end on a positive note, at least: "I will do my best to empower my team to make a great game, however long it takes."
</p>
<p>
If you fancy taking a look at how the game is shaping up pretty much right this very second, you can check out some gameplay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytales-original-co-founder-wastes-no-time-showing-off-the-game-as-it-is-after-buying-the-rights-from-riot">right here</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wd-20tb-external-hard-drive-goes-for-mere-pennies-now-cheaper-than-a-sandisk-4tb-ssd.1361764/</guid>

              <p>External hard drives solve the eternal problem of running out of storage space on computers that never seem to have enough room for everything you accumulate. Photos, videos, games, backups, and work files consume gigabytes faster than anyone anticipates, and cloud storage subscriptions add up to serious money over time. The WD <em>Elements</em>&nbsp;drive offers a massive 20TB capacity that can handle years of storage needs in a single reliable device. After<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/"> launching at $599 before dropping down to the standard price of $349, Amazon just crushed it to $269 for Black Friday</a>. This <strong>record-low pricing is the deepest discount</strong> this popular drive has ever seen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5832/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20TB Capacity Eliminates Storage Anxiety Forever</h2>
<p>Twenty terabytes are ample to the extent that <strong>storage management can be forgotten</strong>. You store around 400,000 high-resolution photos, 5,000 hours of HD video, or even complete media libraries that would fill up in decades. The capacity manages full system backups for several computers and still leaves room for ongoing file build-up. This much space turns your relation to digital files from decisions about what to delete to simply hoarding without consequences.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 interface provides transfer speeds good enough to move big files in fairly reasonable times, considering the mechanical drive inside. You connect to any computer with standard USB ports without requiring special cables, adapters, or driver installations. The plug-and-play functionality means the drive works immediately on Windows and Mac systems out of the box.</p>



<p>The desktop form factor prioritizes capacity and reliability over portability. The drive would sit on your desk, connected to power and USB, serving as a permanent storage expansion rather than as a travel companion. This allows for larger platters and better cooling than portable drives crammed into smaller enclosures.</p>
<p>WD has developed its brand over decades of manufacturing hard drives, and most people associate the company with reliable data storage. The Elements line represents their value-oriented offering, where there is core functionality provided without any premium features that inflate pricing. You get proven WD reliability without paying for software bundles, hardware encryption, or other extras that many users don’t need. The <strong>4.6-star rating across over 332,000 reviews</strong> confirms this reliability extends to real-world usage over years of service.</p>



<p>At this price, the cost per gigabyte beats cloud storage subscriptions within months of ownership. The <strong>cloud plan for 2TB is around $10-15 a month</strong>&nbsp;while equivalent cloud storage would cost hundreds of dollars annually. This drive quickly pays for itself compared to cloud alternatives, and you own the hardware with no recurring fees. Local storage also provides faster access speeds than the internet-dependent cloud services.</p>
<p>Setup involves the<strong> connection of two cables and waiting for your operating system to recognize the new drive</strong>. Windows and Mac both automatically mount the drive without the installation of software or configuration. Drag files to the new drive immediately, and you’re using capacity within minutes of opening the box. The simplicity makes this accessible to anyone regardless of technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $269, you’ll get 20TB of reliable WD storage for more than 50% off its original $599 launch price and 23% off its current list price. The per-terabyte price reaches levels where massive local storage becomes truly affordable. This Black Friday pricing makes the decision to get rid of storage limitations an easy investment that pays dividends for years through avoided cloud subscriptions and permanent file access.</p>
