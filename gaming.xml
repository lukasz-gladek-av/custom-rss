			<p>After <strong>MegaCrit</strong> missed <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">its initial 2025 release goal</a> for <strong>Slay the Spire 2</strong>, the beloved indie developer confirmed today that the long-awaited sequel to the popular roguelike deckbuilder will arrive on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong> Announced during the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fDrSpYlXYI">Indie Fan Fest</a></strong>, its <strong>Early Access</strong> release trailer includes a few sneak peeks at gameplay mixed in between some high-quality animations.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">Back in September 2025</a>, when MegaCrit confirmed that Slay the Spire 2 wouldn't arrive in 2025, it gave a release window that was vague and specific at the same time. The studio confirmed the game would arrive on "<em>a secret Thursday in March</em>." Now we know that Thursday will be the one coming in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>



<p>The return to the Spire will include characters old and new, along with new cards, motives, and plenty of secrets to uncover. It'll also feature four-player co-op if you'd rather have some friends along the way while you make the difficult climb up the Spire.</p>

<p>"<em>The Spire truly is ever-changing</em>,<em> in more ways than one,</em>" reads a post on the game's Steam page that went live alongside the announcement. "<em>More content - including cards, events, environments, enemies, and more - will be added and balanced throughout Early Access. Join the journey early to be part of the Spire's next evolution</em>."</p>



<p>Pre-orders for the game are not yet live, but you can, of course, add it to your wishlist to stay updated for when those pre-orders go live. Slay the Spire 2 was one of our picks for our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Most Anticipated Indie Games of 2026,</a> and it'll be interesting to see how well it matches up to our expectations. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Critical Role actual play is coming at the end of this month. This new show, Draw Your Weapons, is in collaboration with Titmouse Animation, the studio behind many beloved and critically acclaimed mature animated shows and features.</p><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Draw Your Weapons</em> actual play will follow a group of adventurers as they venture across the city of Port Promise and beyond on increasingly unhinged quests. The game will be GM'd by <em>The Tonight Show's</em> Josh Knapp and feature players Rashawn Scott (<em>South Side</em>), Sean Glaze (<em>Regular Show</em>), Heather Mahler, and Jason Charles Miller.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The twist on this actual play comes from the "draw" in the title. As the game progresses, standup comedian Blaine Capatch and Titmouse CEO Chris Prynoski will provide play-by-play commentary, confessional cutaways and live drawing. These drawings will bring the group's worst ideas to life.</p><p>Anything that is drawn like this becomes something the world will have to deal with. This includes monsters, magic items. gadgets, idiotic plans, anything. The result is a show meant to channel "fast, loud DIY/Punk energy." The presser doesn't state what system the game will use, but given the chaotic nature of the premise, just about any system can fit.</p><p>Titmouse Animation has a storied history of making acclaimed animated shows aimed at older audiences. Their work includes the iconic <em>Venture Bros.</em>, the animated <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, the HBO series <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, and even adapting Critical Role's work with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-mighty-nein-season-1-review-but-theres-only-eight-episodes-of-you" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mighty Nein</em></a><em>. </em>They've even started branching into their own <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/titmouses-heady-board-game-drunkards-druggies-delinquents-will-be-available-at-end-of" rel="nofollow">tabletop games</a>.</p><p><em>Draw Your Weapons</em> will debut exclusively on Critical Role's streaming platform Beacon on February 25, 2026 with new episodes released every Wednesday.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sf2-monster-strike-gacha-yoshiki-okamoto-2000671367</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Making games requires testing them. For microtransaction-fueled gacha games, that means putting your own money on the line to sample the merchandise. That’s apparently what led <em>Street Fighter 2</em> producer Yoshiki Okamoto to spend over $500,000 of his own money on his own game’s loot boxes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-strike-is-the-free-to-play-conquering-japan-1708368978"><em>Monster Strike</em></a> is one of Japan’s most lucrative gacha games and it’s one Okamoto helped create after leaving Capcom in the early aughts. You shoot monsters into one another to earn points and buy lottery tickets to acquire stronger characters. The mobile hit peaked a few years ago but has brought in over <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/monster-strike-surpasses-11bn-in-11-years-with-japanese-dominance/">$8 billion in lifetime</a> revenue. It almost singlehandedly saved the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/business/international/monster-strike-gives-former-social-media-giant-mixi-a-second-act.html">social media company Mixi</a> and spawned Nintendo spin-offs and anime adaptations.</p>

 <p>All of which is to say it’s made Okamoto, whose old startup had been failing before that, pretty rich. He recently <a href="https://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2026/02/14/articles/20260214s00041000066000c.html">told Fuji TV</a> (via <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-capcom-producer-spends-over-500000-per-account-on-his-own-gacha-games-to-understand-the-feelings-of-high-spenders/">Automaton</a></em>) that <em>Monster Strike</em>‘s unexpected success led him to go from trying to eat on only two dollars a day to making over $7.81 million a year at his new company, Deluxe Games. Prior to that, Okamoto was known for his work at Capcom and Konami, including the arcade shoot ’em up <i>Gun.Smoke</i> that inspired <em>Red Dead Revolver</em>.</p> <p>But a surprising amount of that money was sunk back into his games so he could experience them like a player would. Those include <a href="https://www.dxg.jp/en/game/">newer releases</a> like last year’s <em>Meteor Arena Stars</em> and <em>Outrankers</em>. Okamoto said he does this to understand the feelings of fans who are spending tons of money and to keep the whales satisfied and coming back. Too stingy and they’ll get mad. Too generous and they’ll get bored.</p>

 <p>He suggested in a <a href="https://x.com/shO8KZ6buaRrqq4/status/2023081539199029457?s=20">follow-up post on X</a> that this would be impossible if he just used admin privileges to unlock all the rewards in his games automatically. Yes, sounds terrible. Definitely not something players would ever want. Who wants to play if you can’t pay?</p>

Oh, and I lied to Doug [Cockle] about him getting sausages to help get the deal across the line… don’t tell him.”</p><p>Previously revealed cast member Doug Cockle added, “The passion, skill, and experience going into the development of this game is phenomenal. I’m always attracted to projects where the team has a clear goal in mind, and the drive and knowledge to reach for it, especially when that goal pushes boundaries. That’s exciting to be part of.

            <guid>1441003</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve played all of the God of War video games, including that one with the Reject Your Child quick time event, and that crappy mobile game from back in the Bush Administration. I played at least one game I only half remember of the God of War card game. I was a Kratos main in PlayStation All-stars Battle Royale. I like the guy, is what I'm saying, as a sort of cathartic avatar of the Id taken to its very tragic limits in Greece, and as a clunky conversation starter about guilt and finding power in something other than grievances in Midgard. But I can’t recall ever wondering “I want to know more about pre-Ares Kratos’ teenage years.” And as an answer to a question I would probably never ask, Sons of Sparta is a pleasant character rehabilitation of a largely unlikable guy couched in a largely boring adventure about Kratos learning the value of responsibility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a pretty mediocre metroidvania, clearly taking the form and function of these games but failing to meet the high bar set by the titans of the genre, let alone bringing anything novel to this specific experience. You’ll move through colorful locations, doing the kind of running, jumping, button pressing, object pushing, and monster slaying that will be second nature to your inner Belmont, but you’ll do so at a pace so slow that it makes the journey feel like aimless wandering, fighting through hordes of baddies with combat that tries too hard to be special but ends up crowded and cloying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I found this young Kratos to be a well-meaning, earnest guy piously (maybe naively so) devoted to the gods and the stubborn defender of his younger brother, Deimos. These are better times for the pair, who have just been granted permission to leave Sparta in order to adventure through and protect the surrounding lands at their own leisure. The well-written banter between them, and the other young people living in the Spartan agoge, reveals the Kratos that could have been, a charismatic, duty-bound leader that is tough when necessary, but also introspective, open to learn, and most jarring of all, funny.</p><p>Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the brief moments of pre-Ares pledge adult Kratos in Sons of Sparta, who is telling his daughter the happenings of the game as a fable while she’s grounded, reveal a man who actually has capacity to love his wife and child in the present, and not just be consumed by rage because of their passing. They banter back and forth in the background as notable in-game events go down, and the way Calliope will cast doubt on the seemingly tall tales of her father, or follow up on moments that either seem contradictory or wrong was charming in the way The Prince attempting to recount his journey in The Sands of Time was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, these don’t really save the story from feeling dull and rote. Sons of Sparta is full of interesting characters that you meet after long stretches of not very interesting travel and exploration. The many locations that Kratos and his brother romp through, like the fiery foundry of Daedalus or the dense and spooky Veiled Bog, look good but there’s nothing all that special or memorable about them. A lot of them seem to be begging to tell the story of what got them to the state they're in, like a haunted Winery that is covered in a goop and being possessed by Grecian Ivan Ooze, or a farming village where all of the residents have been replaced by cultists. But Sons is content with just marching you through a place in service of one long goal, to find a missing student of the Agoge, without stopping to elaborate on any of these side stories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The around 20 hours of my journey was a lot of me wishing I could know more about a cool place I was in, knowing the best I was going to get was a blurb in the lore compendium, checking off every single Metroidvania trope without really any hope of seeing much innovation on the concept. The only “new” idea Sons has about the genre is when the player can expect to gain the signature abilities these games are known for. There's no explicit right or wrong time to gain mechanics, of course, but I went about 10 hours before gaining the ability to drink a healing potion and got a double jump a few hours later, things you might expect to do at the beginning of similar titles. But you spend so much of the early parts of Sons of Sparta running such rudimentary obstacle courses that every time I gained something like the ability to sprint, I felt like I had to wrestle through a fugue state to give it a fair shake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God Of War Sons of Sparta Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism. Armed with a spear and a shield, you'll mash a single attack string, poking and bashing enemies into submission. Normal attacks cause spirit orbs to float out of your targets, which fill your gauge that can be used to turn your blows into spirit attacks, doing less damage but generating health orbs and significantly more stun meter, which you want to build especially on stronger enemies as a stunned opponent is one that can be executed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately missed the attack paths of the other series’, that let you mix light and heavy attacks or control tempo with delay strings. Instead, you can equip different spear shafts that change your combo-enders, providing one big damage attack but very few of which stand out from one another outside of this. One adds a Brad Pitt-style leaping spear thrust that gives your combo a little more range, but I didn’t find fussing over the right last hit to be worth much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the real effective ways to spice up your damage dealing comes from attaching different spear tips that add passive effects. They unlock active abilities as you upgrade them. Not all spear tips are made equal and there are clear stand outs, like one that extends your reach. The reach-extending one’s active ability made every attack hit twice for a brief period of time. These have a more dramatic effect on your playstyle than the shafts, but I rarely strayed away from this tip as it seemed to clearly be the most versatile. I didn’t find many opportunities to get the most out of some funkier ones like the poison tip or ice tip, which do damage over time and slow enemies, respectively, as they’re effects never gave me a clear enough advantage against tougher enemies that seemed just as dangerous under these conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pommels can be added to the bottom of the spear to give Kratos another active ability, these being more like special attacks that spend your spirit meter to do. The differences between these were more dramatic - one allows the spartan to deliver a flurry of thrusts in quick succession while another sends him marching, spear swinging in wide arcs around his body. I changed these up the most to adapt to challenges because each felt tailored to handling specific sorts of the threats. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic offensive tools are those that come from the gifts of the god that Kratos and Deimos invite themselves to possess. These operate like spells that, mostly, give Kratos options he can’t get from his spear and shield - namely good ranged options like Apollo’s sling that lets you launch pellets of solid light at foes, or Hestia's shrub whose leaves toss bouncing flames. They also double as keys to specific sorts of locks that litter the vast world of Laconia, Apollo’s light can power specific generators and Hestia’s fire can burn away prickly bushes. But in combat, they are often your strongest and most restricted tool, limited by a magic gauge that can’t be refilled through your attacks like health and spirit can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s quite a lot of ways to attack the enemies of Sparta, many little ways to modify these, and even more ways to grow and change these modifications through the upgrade crafting system. But so few of these options have remarkable gameplay consequences that incentivized me to explore past my early game habits. I didn’t even consider upgrading any of my spear tips past the level required to get their special abilities, and that was only just so I could see them in action. That isn’t to say the combat is easy, per say, but most of your most effective battle plan is to mash attack when able, after getting a safe moment or two to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies can be diligent and lethal, attacking often and in groups, requiring you to get pretty familiar with Kratos’ powerful defensive tools in order to survive. The parry is great for breaking up combos and putting stun damage on a foe, but it isn’t so strong that you autowin the skirmish after a successful swat, like some other games that might reward a good parry with a free execution. You still have to stay locked in, because the enemy will recover quickly to get back to the beating. Dodges, and the handful of follow up attacks that you can nail after, are necessities as well, and mixed together can make getting out of tougher binds feel rewarding. All of these actions can be modified or enhanced through equipment as well - shield rims can make counter attacks stronger or simply raise your armor and make you tougher to take down, for instance.</p><p>Losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bad guys get a little too cute with the kinds of offense they can dish out, though. Most action games feature enemies who flash red to denote an unblockable attack, but Sons of Sparta can feature enemies with a whopping four different kinds of special attack conditions, modifying whether an attack can be blocked but not evaded, ones that guard break but can be parried, or ones that you can defend in no way shape or form outside of simply not being around when it happens. This maximalist approach to defensive Simon Says creates too many variables in combat with lots of foes, and losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss fights turn the screen filling attack machine up to 10, which is definitely a change of pace They don’t start getting tricky until about the last third of the adventure, but those baddies make you earn through extended chains of pattern recognition and reflex checking bullet storms. The easier ones in the earlier in the game can be more disappointing on the difficulty side, but what all bosses share is that they further remove the opportunity to take advantage of many of your offensive tools, since they seem to be largely immune to status effects and don’t have stun bars. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sons of Sparta does a lot of good PR for Kratos’ early Greek life, filling in the blanks of he and his brother’s early life in a sort of Young Adult coming-of-age story set in a military highschool. The fresh breeze it gives to the would-be God of War is more of a humid fog when it comes to the actual 20 hour game you have to play in between all of the fun character work. Combat makes the most attempts to differentiate Sons from other contemporary Metroidvanias, but is also mostly bloated with options you never have to even investigate, let alone consider. The rest - the exploration, collectible hunting, platforming - are at best run-of-the-mill, with very few locations and moments within them standing out in this game, let alone among the upper echelon of the best games in the genre.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> announces a seismic shakeup of its Mega Pokémon, IGN has chatted with the smash hit smartphone game's developer on the inspirations for the move, what's changing for the better, and what the future of Mega Pokémon looks like in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Niantic announced the addition of a new, tougher Super Mega Raid tier with tougher battle mechanics but better rewards, a fresh currency to engage with Mega and Super Mega raids, and a fourth Mega Evolution tier for your Pokémon to grind for an unlock more bonuses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic says Super Mega Raids will require upwards of seven players, who are strongly encouraged to bring Mega Pokémon into the fight in order to break shields thrown up by the boss during battle. New and existing Mega Pokémon will feature in Super Mega Raid battles over time, and will reward more Mega Energy once defeated. This will come in handy for levelling your own Mega Pokémon to the new Super Max tier, which provides further boosts and allows you to re-Mega your Pokémon every 24 hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most controversially, is the introduction of the new Link Charge currency for Mega and Super Mega Raids. The idea here is that this, like Max Particles, provides a separate method to access in-game content that doesn't just rely on raid passes (though you can still use raid passes for Megas if you choose). How exactly this will be balanced, however, remains to be seen — though Niantic says it will provide better value. Read on for more detail on all of the above in our chat with Pokémon Go's senior producer John Funtanilla.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hey John, great to chat with you again. Let's start with Super Mega Raids — is the pitch here that they're going to be the equivalent of Gigantamax in terms of difficulty and launch cadence? Will we really need seven or more players as has been indicated?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah, the mission with Super Mega Raids is similar to Gigantamax and we want to lean into the community play aspect of the game that's gone very well. We want to make sure that we're gathering folks and we have seen a lot of success with that — communities of sometimes hundreds of players in San Francisco going up and down on the piers playing together. That really inspired us and we know that was happening all across the globe. Not to say that there wasn't also some Trainers that also did low count lobbies and were challenging themselves to beat these Gigantamax battles with four or five players. We're very careful with the tuning and we were kind of surprised by that, but we do feel like if you're a really talented player, you understand the systems, you are able to do different strategies that beat these raids. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of the same thing. We are targeting around a seven to eight player headcount to win, and that's pretty sizable, but again, it's related to how big your communities are, and being able to find the communities. I can go into it a little bit later, but I would say yes, expect same kind of level of difficulty for Gigantamax and there's some mechanics in there that require group play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Right, there's mention of shield breaking mechanics which sound interesting. I find Gigantamax battles fun because they do require extra strategy, but I know you always have to balance that with the fact your playerbase has a mix of hardcore players and more casual 'Korean grandmas'. You have to fit both those things, to some degree. So, were there any learnings from Gigantamax that you applied here to the new Mega changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Gigantamax was such an ambitious effort. We really wanted to introduce a whole new system. As you know, there's the three Max moves, there's Power Spots. It was a massive, massive effort to finally bring in and actually unlock Gen 8 into the game. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of an incremental approach. It's a little bit more challenging than normal raids, but other than that it does play using a normal raid battle format. We explored different mechanics and we didn't want to veer away to something that was unfamiliar to players — so we added different iterations on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking through what this type of battle is, Trainers will need to bring in a Mega Pokémon — it's not required, but we definitely encourage you to bring one in to take down one of those shields. And when we're playtesting internally, people are bringing in Mega Pokémon, and when that last person comes in, there's this big climactic moment where the shields break. There's an amazing visual but not only that, though, there's a huge amount of damage that's done to that boss. And so you get to that powered up form, you're trying to chip away at it, you're yelling at other players to bring in their Mega Pokémon. If they were knocked out, tell them to relobby, heal that Pokémon, bring it back in. We really wanted to lean into that. And that's why I keep saying we wanted community play to be kind of streamlined for this one, it's less tactical than Max Battles but we wanted that excitement, that energy that comes from that moment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/super-mega-raids-key-art-16x9-1771519124281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel will debut at Pokémon Go Tour. Image credit: Niantic</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nice, and then just to clarify — could you get into a situation where maybe no one has any Mega Pokémon left, could you still break the shields at that point?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> That can be a state that does happen, maybe one person doesn't have a Mega Pokémon. There are ways that we try to alleviate that. So we've recreated the first time user experience, so this time we put the tutorial right in front of you as soon as you log into the game and that triggers and you'll catch your first Mega Pokémon. You'll understand the utility of it, you'll catch another Pokémon of that species to understand that you get more Mega Energy. So there is an update to this, but we've tried to kind of lift the total tide for the entire feature and include UX improvements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think some of the big reasoning that we gave for actually diving in and improving the Mega system is that we felt that players — looking at the data — weren't engaging with Megas as met as much as we'd seen, especially for something as powerful and with as much utility as they have. That was the biggest thing — improving things all across the board so by the time you get into the Super Mega raid you feel prepared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So unfortunately it is a scenario that can happen, but we're hoping that a player realizes that they don't have a Mega Pokémon involved, they back out to the lobby, they come back in and they're going to be that one person that breaks the shield. And I've seen that many times. So I think after players have gone through this a few times, hopefully they'll understand like, 'Oh, I should bring a Mega Pokémon in. I see everyone with their Mega Pokémon and there's toasts and texts that keep saying bring a Mega Pokémon in.' So yeah, we're making it easy for players to have a Mega Pokémon and reminding them to bring it in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And a quick one: is the reason the Primals don't count as Megas here lore-related? As they're not technically Megas?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100% lore. They're not Mega Pokémon. They have the same kind of power, but The Pokémon Company created the lore which is that technically they're not identified as Mega Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's discuss Link Charges, which are the third sort-of currency for interacting with battles in Pokémon Go, on top of the existing raid passes and Max Particles. Obviously people love looking at datamined information and drawing their own conclusions, and there's been conversation already around Link Charges potentially offering more activities to do for free but also being another currency to keep track of, and separately work within the limits of. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> I saw that reaction from players too. You know how it goes, players will see things with a limited amount of information, but obviously there's still a huge portion of the feature coming out and players are yet to experience it for themselves. I did want to set the perspective on that which is that we had a lot of learnings from Max Particles. So yes, there's the system where you can get a daily free raid pass, there's a system where you can engage with Power Spots and get Max Particles, and then we have Link Charges, which is the new currency. I think the biggest thing here is we want to give players access to premium content. We also want to make sure that we're encouraging and incentivizing engagement into our social features. </p><p>"When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We just put out the Weekly Challenges. We have community check-ins, we love the gifting feature. Those are things we want to encourage and we see players engaging with these a lot, but those lead directly towards the Niantic mission. And with Link Charges, for us, these are ways for players to have flexible access to premium content. When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass, so there is some kind of discount there. We always want to encourage IRL play and as long as you're doing some of the social actions I mentioned, we reward that effort. And with community check-ins, we understand that's a high value effort action. We reward that, we give you a ton of link charges, you check in, you're good, you're set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So you do get a lot of Link Charges and we learned from Max Particles to increase the cap higher. There are some other aspects where we understand that the content is very, very premium and it's difficult to challenge. So with Super Mega Raids, remoting into those does have an added cost of extra Link Charges, and again, it's like a balance that we have to form with the system. With economy, I think it all comes down to flexibility. If you're a player that doesn't want to pay too much, but you love engaging with the game, you love engaging with your community, gifting, things like that, we want to make sure that you have flexible ways to access that content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have you nailed down how many Link Charges you can hold at a time, how many you'll need for a Mega Raid (is it just one?), how many you'll need for a Super Mega Raid?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> The tuning will definitely be in different denominations than raid passes. Raid passes is like one for [a specific battle]. Link Charges are again like a currency. We're still tuning it, and that's likely going to be something that we're looking at as we're playtesting it internally, reviewing it with the team. Again, the stance we want to take is that playing in person will be cheaper, and it's going to be cheaper than a battle pass, and it's not going to require a battle pass. That's a fundamental part of the system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And I guess the same question on how much it might cost to buy Link Charges in the shop. Can you give an equivalent to buying a raid pass?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">John Funtanilla: It'll be better value, 100%. The final tuning, we're still getting to that, but better value is the main thing that we keep driving here. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/link-charges-1771519388676.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Your new Link Charge Holder. Image: Niantic</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While we're talking raid passes, something I've come up against in my community is the issue with remote raid passes in Max Battles — where players sometimes fail a battle, can't rejoin, and don't get that remote pass refunded. Max Particles are only consumed when a battle is successful, but remote passes get used up regardless. Are you aware of this, and how will it work with remote battles using Link Charges?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100%. I think the biggest way to look at it, is we learned so much from the Max Particle system. We really pushed for Max Particles not being consumed until you win. Raid passes, meanwhile, are applied to the gym or Power Spot when you join the battle and that means until you win, you can keep trying. Max Particles and Link Charges [work similarly], so those will be consumed at the end of the battle once you win. That's a key learning that we wanted to carry forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For remote raid passes, I totally understand and that it might not be as favorable. There is still that leeway again that you can keep trying, though for remote passes you do have to somehow get back into that same gym and that does mean that the player, whoever invited you or if you joined their lobby, they've got to get you back in there. I do think there are some aspects to improve for that, but when we introduce new systems, we're trying to learn from that. We're trying to make it better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're constantly talking with the player experience team for raiders, and they're looking at players trying to understand what problems are coming in. So we see that a lot and we try to build ways to reimburse if there's a crash, things like that. I understand it's not the best system, but we're trying to improve it with everything that we put in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The timing of these changes happening now feels interesting, because not only do you have the longer-term player behavior around using Megas that you mentioned, but you have the first new Mega Evolutions from Pokémon Legends Z-A coming into the game at Go Tour, with Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel. Certainly from player behavior I've seen, Megas have felt like one-and-done releases which don't really benefit the community or new players — and it sounds like you've seen data that suggests they're underused too.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah... I mentioned earlier the core problem is that from the data we're looking at and player behavior, players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are. You get that CP stat increase when you Mega Evolve, you can use that in raids, you get boosted ally attacks, you get increased candy. These are things where we only see the most hardcore high level players interacting with it. That's a problem. It's such a great feature. It's in its third or fourth iteration now, and so we wanted to bring that to the game. </p><p>"Players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for Super Mega Raids, it's the same thing. Is the utility of your Mega Pokémon worth evolving, worth bringing into Super Mega or original Mega Raids? We want to make sure you feel like your Pokémon are powerful and are meaningful. It didn't matter if it's a 1500CP Mega Beedrill or a crazy Mega Rayquaza. You both are truly important to the battle and you both can take down a shield. That was important for us, we wanted players all across that gradient to feel like they can come in and make an impact on that. And if you can't provide damage like a level 50 player, you're still breaking a shield, you're still helping the community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the new Super Max level. This is just a start and I thing I can't really talk too much about right now, but when I say that Pokémon is invested in Megas, we are truly invested in that. We have a roadmap for the year. This is just the beginning of that rollout for players right now. It might not seem like there's a lot, but there's the Super Max level coming out and there's going to be new systems built on top of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Part of today's announcement mentions that bonuses vary by Pokémon when Mega Evolving. Is that just due to typing, like a Grass-type Mega gives advantages when catching Grass-type Pokémon? Or will there be specific bonuses for specific Mega Pokémon, almost akin to Adventure Effects?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> You're asking all the right questions. I can't speak to a lot of that right now, we just need to have that space open and it allows us freedom to create different things there. We do have to leave it open-ended because if we want to design something cool and a different Pokémon at that Super Max level is different from another, that's something that we can design. I hope players will enjoy it with Super Max level coming out and understand that there's a much longer runway that we're kind of cooking in the lab right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One thing you have confirmed as forthcoming is the ability to spend Mega Energy to boost up your Mega Level. How are you balancing the cost there versus the lengthy process now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla: </strong>Yeah, so to get to Super Max level will be a good chunk of Mega Energy and that's why I do think it'll be important for players to keep raiding that Pokémon and collecting Mega Energy to use it for that sink. For that last level, you won't need to continuously Mega Evolve, it'll just be one sink for you to spend your Mega Energy on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then once there, you can Mega Evolve it every 24 hours without expending Mega Energy, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> That's correct. We looked at it, there's not a lot of players that get there. Some players are trying to optimize and Mega Evolve and they have a tag, but for the players that do get there, it's going to be rewarding for sure. So yeah, it is going to be free, you get that cooldown, you can use it again. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/gettyimages-2165351181-1771524578593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go celebrates its 10th anniversay this year. Image credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned a long runway for Mega features, there's also now a much longer list of Mega Pokémon. Are there any learnings there from the release of previous Mega Pokémon? It felt like it was taking a very long time for every Mega to release, and we got to the point last year where most of the remaining few were launched quickly to clear the decks for the Z-A additions. What can people expect the cadence of new Mega Pokémon to be going forward?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> It is crazy to think we've reached the end of the road for the existing Mega Pokémon —</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You are sat in front of a picture of Mewtwo, so I should point out that people are still waiting there...</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> [laughs] I know, what is this guy doing here? But yeah, the biggest thing there is that we took a look at all the features in the game. Megas were underneath the magnifying glass for us. We were trying to figure out what to do with this. Partly the reason for all of this was that we're were nearing the end of that [initial batch of Mega Pokémon] runway. But also we need to do some really, really exciting stuff this year and need to make sure we have the right foundations for that. For the new Mega Pokémon from Z-A, the DLC, there's such cool things to work with there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Super Mega Raids we can probably kind of map that to how a community might behave. I would like to see, around every one to two months, a big gigantic, Super Mega community raid day. We're still trying to figure out the best thing that works. The biggest thing to anchor it to is how we'd like to see people be able to interact with their communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>On Mewtwo, would the 10th anniversary of the game this summer be a fitting time to finally launch its Mega Evolutions?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> We have a lot to show to the players. You're kind of seeing all the foundations for that kind of being put down now and even in the last few years, almost in the shadows... All I can say is that the 10th anniversary for Pokémon Go, the 30th for Pokémon, means you can expect a really, really exciting year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <title><![CDATA[Time-Traveling Shooter Time Takers Announces Closed Beta Test]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/time-traveling-shooter-time-takers-announces-closed-beta-test</link>
            <guid>1440991</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-person, team-based shooter Time Takers recently announced that a closed beta test will begin on March 13 and shared details about what you can expect from this first look at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time Takers is developed by Mistil Games, published by NCSOFT, and focuses on fast-paced matches where you compete for time itself. It combines elements of survival shooters and battle royales, but it isn’t defined only by kills, it’s about stealing or defending time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has a lifespan that’s fueled by Time Energy, and it gradually depletes. Your lifespan is represented on screen as a timer ticking down. You can hold a maximum of 5 minutes and 30 seconds, and if your timer reaches zero, you’re eliminated. If you’re killed with time still left on your clock, you’ll lose some Time Energy but respawn. You can lengthen your lifespan by earning more Time Energy, which you can get by killing other players, defeating monsters on the field, or picking it up from spawn points around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you accumulate Time Energy, it will also fill your level gauge. As you level up, your character’s unique skills will be unlocked and upgraded in a set sequential order. Collecting Time Energy will also grant you a currency called Time Coins, which can be used to purchase or upgrade passive abilities on the respawn screen or at shops scattered across the map. At any time, you can manually sacrifice some of your current lifespan to add to your level gauge and level up. This obviously puts you at risk of dying faster, but it can be key to unlocking an ability you really need. You have to decide which is more important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each match progresses through seven phases, and you can see your current phase in the top left corner of the screen. With each phase that passes, Time Energy spawn points get more rare and your lifespan depletes faster. Those spawn points also gradually get closer together, until the final phase has only one spawn in a specific spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system means a couple things. For one, simply camping in one place is unreliable. If you do that, you risk watching your lifespan tick away with no way to replenish it. You have to stay on the move to reach spawn points or take out opponents frequently. Second, the shrinking spawn points force combatants into smaller spaces as phases progress. This also rewards players who pay attention to where the spawn points are in each phase, since you can come up with an optimal route to efficiently gather energy and level up as quickly as possible.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/onl-yokogawa-3person-highangle-0159-1771367038314.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So in short, you’ll need to decide in each battle how to approach things. Do you want to minimize risk at the beginning, sneaking around the battlefield to gather Time Energy and level up your abilities without directly fighting anyone? Or do you want to go in guns blazing, hunting down opponents to steal their Time Energy as quickly as possible and put them on the defensive immediately?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first closed beta test will include 12 playable characters, each of whom have unique skills and playstyles. Matches in the closed beta will be in trios, with four teams of three players each, and you’ll need to coordinate with your team. You’ll each lock in your character and weapon before the match, with no duplicates allowed on the same team. Characters are grouped into Damage Dealer, Support, and Tank archetypes, but your choice of weapon can help define your role. For instance, there are support-oriented weapons that allow you to heal, while there are high-DPS weapons for close-range (flamethrowers) and long-range (sniper rifles) combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the match, if you stay close to your teammates, you’ll form a link. While linked, teammates acquire Time Energy simultaneously and can transfer it between each other to cover for someone whose time is running out. If you want to take advantage of this, it can alter your team’s weapon choices, passive abilities, and tactical approach.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-006-1771367110243.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, if someone on your team wants to use a sniper rifle, that can give them a huge advantage if they reach high ground with good sight lines. But they’d likely have to stay separate from their teammates, weakening the link for the whole team. However, equipping the Link Repeater passive will cancel that out and allow you to link up no matter the distance. So unlocking that passive quickly becomes a top priority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combatants and battlefields are pulled from different eras of the past and future, and environments and conditions will change as matches progress. Momentum can shift at the drop of a hat, thanks in large part to Pods, which can spawn randomly and grant benefits to the first person to interact with it. Those benefits include temporarily pausing your lifespan depletion, the ability to launch a missile at a specific enemy, or a Weapon Exchange Voucher that will let you switch to a different weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beta will include three maps: Yokogawa, Morstadt, and Miraesi, which represent the wide range of time periods depicted in Time Takers. Yokogawa is pre-modern Japanese themed and shaped by traditional architecture. Morstadt is based on medieval times, with stone structures and layered routes. And Miraesi is a futuristic setting inspired by Seoul that blends dense urban layouts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-004-1771367204142.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The closed beta will run from March 13–21, with 8 hours of playable time each day, and it’s focused on players in eight countries: the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. If you live in one of those countries, you can sign up to join the beta through the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=cbt1&amp;utm_content=feature_article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam page</u></a>. Sign-ups are open now, and it will still be possible to sign up while the beta is ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t live in one of those countries, you’ll have a chance to get access to the beta through the Time Takers <a href="https://discord.gg/timetakers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord channel</u></a>. If you join the channel and invite a friend to join too, you can be selected to take part in the beta no matter where in the world you are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>An internal memo from Sony has revealed they are to shut down Bluepoint Games, the developer responsible for the remasters of Shadow of the Colossus. Uncharted, and Gravity Rush on PS4, and the Demon Souls remake for PS5.</p>
<p>Bluepoint had been working on a live service game, but this was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-confirms-cancellation-of-live-service-projects-from-bend-studio-and-bluepoint-games">cancelled</a> in January 2025. Sony bought Bluepoint in 2021, and they have never released a game as a PlayStation studio, although they did work on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/">God of War Ragnarok</a>.</p>


<p>Here is the email in full:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to share an important update from the Studio Business.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within&nbsp;PlayStation&nbsp;Studios.&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghos</a>t<a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"> of Yotei</a></em>&nbsp;launched to critical and commercial success,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>&nbsp;further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>MLB The Show</em>&nbsp;continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.</p>
<p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p>
<p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p>
<p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftsmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p>
<p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for fiscal year 26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Hermen Hulst<br>
CEO, Studio Business Group</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="7f75bf19ff7c9"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7f75bf19ff7c9/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes, I don't realise how much I'm missing out of something until it's right in front of me.</p>
<p>That's not to say I never wanted or expected a 60fps upgrade for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> — it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/a-hidden-60fps-mode-in-xenoblade-chronicles-x-gives-us-hope-for-a-switch-2-upgrade">apparently right there in the code</a>, after all — but I've already put the time in. 120 hours of wondrous exploration, sci-fi storytelling, and mech flying, all wrapped up and put to one side. It's easy to forgive Xenoblade Chronicles X being <em>just</em> 30fps and 720p (handheld, which is how I played almost the entire game) on Switch 1 when it's so huge in scope and so easy to get lost in its lush environments and dangerous wilds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82rhwqty&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>But then I sat down with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the difference was staggering. No more blips when it's raining, no more stuttering when the camera pans as Elma shows your character the world of Mira for the first time. This is the Mira we deserve to see and explore.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is the smallest paid Switch 2 Edition yet from Nintendo, providing <em>only</em> a resolution bump (1080p handheld, 4K docked) and performance boost (a steady 60fps both handheld and docked). But it's hard not to be impressed when you see Monolith Soft's vision be fully realised on-screen. It's amazing we've never had a <strong>Xenoblade</strong> game at 60fps before this, and it's a real showcase of just how much more beautiful and smooth these worlds can look.</p>

<p>Mira is already incredible, quite possibly the best video game environment to explore ever, so I did what any self-respecting Xenoblade fan would do when first booting up the Switch 2 Edition — get myself murdered, and my Skells destroyed, by some oversized creature in Noctilum. Death and explosions in 60fps are much better than at 30fps, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Besides engaging with things way beyond my skill set, I spent most of my time zipping in and out of combat, scrambling around the flatlands of Oblivia, and diving off of cliffs in Primordia into the ocean. The Switch version already gave me a whole new appreciation for Mira, but seeing these glorious, alien creatures wander around the Rising Energy Mist phenomenon of Sylvalum, or gigantic dinosaur-esque monsters stomping around amidst the Oblivia thunderstorms.</p>
<p>I also spent way too much time flying around each of the maps in my Skell this time around, impressed with just how stable things were as I glided between biomes and swarmed through groups of flying enemies. It didn't matter whether I was in combat, swamped by six or seven enemies in mid-air, falling from great heights, or in cutscenes, I didn't notice a single dip.</p>

<p>I was actually surprised at how snappy the combat felt now, too. In some classes, especially on foot, I always felt there was a slight input delay when trying to combo skills together. That <em>feels</em> like it's been lessened a bit, because I can connect Side Slash and Stream Edge almost-instantaneously. I don't feel like I'm waiting an extra half a second for the animations to play out anymore.</p>
<p>The near-perfect frame rate boost does most of the heavy lifting in both handheld and docked, here, but the performance boost is nothing to sneeze at, either, especially handheld. The jump from 720p (on Switch 1) to 1080p (on Switch 2) is a real boon, with landscapes less blurry and draw-distances a little clearer. There are still plenty of fuzzy textures and noticeably flat, dull surfaces on some cliffs and creatures, but it's a significantly better experience now.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6d820f982758"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6d820f982758/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of docked, the 4K bump actually felt a lot less significant to my untrained eye. The boost is most-noticeable around characters' faces and eyes, and the lighting appears to be improved — the difference in the character creator between backdrops was more apparent this time around, for example — but again, some of those flat tree leaves and blades of grass are a little hard to ignore.</p>
<p>These are nitpicks, however, when Xenoblade Chronicles X is <em>such</em> a huge game. Are you really going to be quibbling over a single blade of grass when you can fly sky-high and glide across the starry sky, moon shining in the background? Or when you can see the flames of Cauldros in the distance as you stand high in the trees of Noctilum?</p>
<p>I think there's a separate conversation to be had over what a Switch 2 Edition is, especially when plenty of other games are getting free performance boosts on the console. Many were having the same discussions about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' upgrade last month, but at least that added Mouse Mode and additional multiplayer capabilities on top of a resolution bump.</p>
<figure data-uuid="63c00bf925bf6"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63c00bf925bf6/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But I do know a lot of people who were holding off on Xenoblade Chronicles X until it got a boost on Switch 2, so if that applies to you, this release is a no brainer in my eyes. If you stopped playing on Switch 1, too, now is the time to dive in. Just don't come for the story — stay instead for the incredible landscapes and sense of discovery, now looking the best it ever will.</p>
<p>And, at the very least, this Nintendo Switch 2 Edition gets me excited about the potential of future upgrades for the rest of the Xenoblade series.

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/">Embark Studios</a></strong> has just revealed the next update and <strong>map condition</strong> coming to <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, with <strong>hurricanes</strong> arriving next week on <strong>February 24, 2026,</strong> in the game's new <strong>Shrouded Sky </strong>update.</p>



<p>The short teaser doesn't show any gameplay, but it does make it clear how disruptive and dangerous the hurricanes will be for raiders who choose to brave the weather while the condition is in effect. A <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/surviving-the-hurricane-map-condition">blog post</a> on the ARC Raiders' official website digs further into what raiders will have to deal with, and it's a little more than some high-speed winds.</p>



<p>"<em>The climate is damaged and unpredictable, causing violent weather events across the surface,</em>" the post reads. "<em>You've already experienced some of them, but southern Italy is about to kick up another challenge to Raiders who dare to brave the surface</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Shrouded Sky - Teaser | ARC Raiders" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9lGpwVvdyJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Trying to run against the winds, as you might imagine, will slow you down and quickly drain your stamina. You'll also have to be aware of the wind when trying to toss grenades or other throwables, since they can be swept away into the wind if you don't properly plan your throw. You also won't be able to rely on gas grenades and smoke grenades in the same way, as a turn of the wind will impact them as well.</p>



<p>You'll also have to be aware of flying debris, whether that's flying bits of dirt or something much larger that could do some huge damage if you're not careful. Whatever it is, though, your shield will take damage from flying debris and make you more visible to other raiders. That said, if you choose to risk going Topside without a shield, that'll provide another layer of camouflage, since you won't be spotted by the constant flash of your shield. </p>



<p>Speaking of visibility, that's also going to be far more limited during the hurricanes, meaning you'll have to be even more vigilant to make sure you're not caught off guard by other raiders or ARC. With all of this downside and struggles involved in heading Topside while hurricanes are raging the surface, you're probably wondering why it's worth the risk.</p>



<p>That upside comes in the form of valuable Raider caches that aren't just your average caches, but caches from the <strong>First Wave</strong>, which ARC Raiders lore-heads will recognize as caches from a bygone era, surely to be filled with valuable loot. We'll see what that loot looks like when the new map condition arrives this coming <strong>Tuesday, February 24, 2026.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/</link>
            <guid>1440922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>We've been surprised by video game studio closures before, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/"><strong>Xbox </strong>shut down <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> and <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>,</a> but this latest studio closure is arguably the most shocking one we've seen in a long time. <strong>Bluepoint Games</strong>, the studio responsible for the <strong>Demon's Souls Remake</strong> and decades of remakes and remasters across several iconic franchises, is being <strong>shut down by</strong> <strong>PlayStation</strong>.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> who broke the news that just <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-acquire-bluepoint-games/">five years after</a></strong> the studio officially joined the <strong>PlayStation Studios</strong> family, its remaining <strong>70 developers</strong> are losing their jobs in what is yet another baffling decision by PlayStation leadership.</p>



<p>"<em>Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,</em>" a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement, per Bloomberg's report. "<em>We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftsmanship</em>."</p>







<p>After the Demon's Souls Remake was one of the day-one launch titles for the release of the <strong>PS5</strong>, and the studio was officially brought under the PlayStation Studios banner, there was never an official confirmation as to what the studio was working on next. We knew it had done some co-development work on <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, and beyond that, there were plenty of rumours and hopes. Bluepoint was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-remaster-sequel/">popular choice for players to do a <strong>Bloodborne Remaster</strong></a> if that project were to ever actually happen.</p>



<p>The most reliable answer we have as to what the studio has been working on also came from a previous Bloomberg report, which was a <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-live-service-canceled/"><strong>God of War live-service</strong> game that was cancelled at the start of 2025</a>. According to today's report from Bloomberg, following that project's cancellation, Bluepoint did its best to pitch future projects to <strong>Herman Hulst</strong> and the rest of PlayStation's top brass, none of which were accepted, it would seem.</p>



<p>As if this couldn't be any more tragic than it already was, the studio was celebrating its <strong>20th anniversary</strong> this year, after being founded all the way back in <strong>2006</strong>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios is Finally Giving ARC Raiders Players Facial Hair]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-giving-arc-raiders-players-what-they-want/</link>
            <guid>1440910</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has uncovered what’s coming next with Shrouded Sky, the update hitting ARC Raiders next week. Alongside a teaser trailer that revealed the new map condition as ‘Hurricane’, we received a graphic that contained a <strong>stark revelation</strong> that has fans excited.</p>



<p>After months of asking for them, it looks like Embark Studios is finally adding beards to the customization menu in ARC Raiders. The post-apocalyptic Speranza residents who have all gone rather baby-faced up until now might finally be able to wear a little face fur after Shrouded Sky drops.</p>







<h2 id="h-beards-are-coming-to-arc-raiders">Beards Are Coming to ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>If you’ve been holding out hope that Embark Studios would add beards to ARC Raiders, it looks like you’re finally in luck. In the new teaser trailer for Shrouded Sky, we’re treated to a graphic that shows a raider very clearly sporting a relatively large beard.</p>



<p>That’s important for one major reason, and it’s that up until now, every shot of in-game characters has had them wearing clothing sets that can be equipped <strong>in-game</strong>. It also has them exclusively showing off hairstyles, tattoos, and face decorations that you can buy or unlock in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>This is the first time we’ve seen a raider with a full beard.</p>



<p>Therefore, we’re led to believe, very patently, that beards are coming to ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>It could be in anticipation of the new Shrouded Sky update, which drops on February 24th. It brings <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-hurricane-new-map-condition/">the ‘Hurricane’ map condition</a>, which will batter players with vicious winds, flying debris, and harsh rain. Perhaps wearing a beard is some extra layer of protection against the detritus flying around, slamming you in the face.</p>



<p>That’s probably not the reason.</p>



<p>Beards were always on the cards, in reality. This is a slow-feed, live-service title with plenty of meat, and Embark Studios plans to support it for years to come. We were always going to get beards; it’s just a matter of when.</p>



<p>Now, all that matters is for us to find out how deep the facial hair runs. Will we get moustaches and goatees, too? It’s anyone’s guess.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re excited about facial hair coming to ARC Raiders.</p>

<p>"Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community," a PlayStation spokesperson said in a statement received by <em>Bloomberg</em>. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>writes that the spokesperson also said the closure was due to "a recent business review." The most recent news out of the studio was that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">it was working on a live-service game in the God of War universe</a>, but that it was canceled before ever being revealed publicly.</p><p>The news is shocking, largely due to Bluepoint's high-quality track record. The studio was founded in 2006, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/30/welcoming-bluepoint-games-to-the-playstation-studios-family/">but wasn't acquired by PlayStation until 2021</a>. Demon's Souls, the studio's most recent project, is a remake of the game of the same name that launched alongside the PS5. We gave it a 9.25 at the time, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/demons-souls-ps5/demons-souls-review-hello-dark-souls-my-old-friend">calling it a "delightful treat."</a> Bluepoint also assisted in the development of God of War Ragnarök, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok/next-to-godliness">which we gave a 9.5</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/goty-2022/2022/12/23/game-informers-top-10-games-of-2022">lauded as our second favorite game of 2022</a>.</p><p><em><strong>[Source: </strong></em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-19/sony-is-shutting-down-the-playstation-studio-bluepoint?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTUyNzAyNiwiZXhwIjoxNzcyMTMxODI2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQVBZWlBLR0lGUFkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.utABYnI4m_K6kqNqybZarBQ9T5WW_aWCH6NI3kt8Q64&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em><strong>Bloomberg</strong></em></a><em><strong>]</strong></em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/playstation-shuts-down-bluepoint-games-makers-of-demons-souls-and-shadow-of-the-colossus]]></content:encoded>
