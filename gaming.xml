<p>It looks like made by AI even though the movie is official by Paramount.<br>
Not for me.<br>
The Street Fighter Parody from City Hunter movie when Jackie Chan become Street Fighter character (E.Honde, Chun Li) is still the best funny moment from old movies. 🤣<br></p>

<p>Even if the movie looked any good - and it really, really doesn't - casting a white guy with a history of racist jokes as Dan is enough to make this a never watch for me.</p></section>

		<p>Traveler’s Tales has shared another look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, showing off Batman and his rogue’s gallery in action.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Heroes &amp; Villains Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xciD-Vz6T_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is set to be the biggest Lego Batman game by far, both in how it’s going open world with its Lego antics, and in taking inspiration from across the full history of Batman, across movies, TV shows, and the comics. This trailer showed little snippets of gameplay interspersed with characters like Catwoman (who can summon a cat to scratch people up), Robin, and iconic villains Two Face, Penguin and Joker</p>
<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is set to launch on 29th May 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2 and PC</p>

		<p>Nagoshi Studio has revealed Gang of Dragon, and it certainly looks like Toshihiro Nagoshi, the former general director of Ryu Ga Gotoko Studio, is looking to outdo his former team!</p>

<p>It’s certainly a very good looking game with exceptional character animation, lighting and performance capture as the protagonist is confronted in a bar.</p>
<p>What follows is snippets of car driving, sword fighting, hand-to-hand martial arts and more.</p>
<p>Nagoshi left Sega and RGG back in 2021 alongside several other former Sega employees to found Nagoshi Studio as a subsidiary of NetEase.</p>

		<p>Control Resonant has just been announced at the Game Awards with a man hanging from the ceiling and then being shoved in a big glass box, closely followed by a pigeon exploding. Yep. we’re back in the world of Control and it looks like things have escaped from the Oldest House.</p>
<p>You will be playing as a Dylan Faden who appeared in the first game as the character P6, and he also in Alan Wake 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Control Resonant - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1_eZyFM5-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Explore a warped Manhattan on the brink of paranatural annihilation in this thrilling action-adventure RPG. Unleash the extraordinary powers of Dylan Faden as he fights for his humanity and survival against a reality-bending cosmic threat.”</em></p>
<p>Control Resonant was originally announced back in November 2022 when Remedy Entertainment and 505 Games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> an agreement to co-develop and co-publish the new game. At that point Control 2, as it was known, was still in the initial pre-production concept stage, with an initial budget of €50 million.</p>

<p>Things changed in 2024 when Remedy Entertainment has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a> franchise as a whole from 505 Games, including both the already-released 2019 game, and any future projects.&nbsp; Remedy asked for this freedom in order to give themselves a fresh chance to either self-publish the games or find a new publishing partner for these two games.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what they did a few months later when Remedy Entertainment and Annapurna <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">announced</a> a strategic partnership which will see Annapurna provide 50% of the development budget for Control 2. Additionally, the two companies will work together on bringing Control and Alan Wake to both film and television. Annapurna’s main focus will primarily be the films and shows, allowing Remedy to focus on the game development side of things.</p>
<p>Control Resonant will launch in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warlock Is a Single Player Open World Action/Adventure Game Set in the World of D&D and Due in 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/warlock-single-player-open-world-action-adventure-game-set-in-dd-out-2027/</link>
            <guid>1380829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During a remote press presentation ahead of TGA 2025, publisher Wizards of the Coast and developer Invoke Studios (previously known as Tuque Games, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance-dungeons-that-drag-on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance</a>) revealed Warlock, a single player third-person action/adventure game targeting a 2027 launch. This is the Unreal Engine 5 powered game that was previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to be in development in October 2022. Invoke currently employs between 180 and 200 developers in Montréal. Several of them have experience with action-adventure games and immersive simulations, which is why they chose that direction for this game. </p>



<p>In a twist from usual D&amp;D-based games, the developers have focused specifically on one of the many classes available in the tabletop RPG, the Warlock. Since it's a magic class, they confirmed that magic will be used not just in combat but also to traverse the game world. Often, there are direct uses for the spells, but the creators also teased that there will be a lot of lateral thinking in how to apply them creatively. They also added that there will be plenty of player agency when it comes to world exploration.</p>



<p>Not only do you play specifically the Warlock, but the protagonist is also predefined rather than player-created. She's called Kaatri, and she's made a Pact with a dangerous being to get her powers. She was actually a weapon master before she became a Warlock, which she did for her own personal reasons that players will discover during the game. Her previous career as a weapon master means she is adept at handling various melee weapons, more so than a usual Warlock. Invoke claims that one of the main goals is to combine melee and magic spells very smoothly. Kaatri is played by the renowned actress Tricia Helfer, previously seen in popular TV shows such as Battlestar Galactica and Lucifer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WARLOCK - Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ayW7oCXggoE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Obviously, the game does not seek to replicate the tabletop experience at all, which means no dice rolling and the like. This is partly to ensure that those who are not familiar with D&amp;D can easily come in and enjoy the game from the get-go without knowing a lot, or anything really, about the ruleset. That said, the wealth of lore available to D&amp;D absolutely informed the story and setting of the game, and the developers who attended the presentation teased that there would be familiar characters to meet.</p>



<p>When I asked about co-op, Invoke's VP Creative Jeff Hattem replied that the team made it single player only because they wanted to craft a focused story that had momentum and stakes. There also won't be dialogue choices and branching options. Gameplay will be released next Summer. Until then, sit tight.</p>

<p>In another victory for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/control-resonant-trademark-applied-for-in-europe-by-law-firm-remedy-have-used-multiple-times">trademark paperwork diggers</a>, weird fiction action-RPG sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> is in fact Control Resonsant, as confirmed by an announcement and trailer at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">The Game Awards 2025</a>.  It’s out in 2026 and swaps <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a>’s telekinesis-aided shooting for melee thwacking. Said thwacking takes place across a Manhattan that’s suffering from more than a dash of catastrophic reality breakdown, as teased - this time intentionally by developers Remedy - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2s-the-lake-house-is-a-dark-brilliant-parable-on-the-devaluation-of-art-and-artists">The Lake House</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's also got a new protagonist in Dylan Faden, twin brother to original lead Jesse, who after seven years of running the Federal Bureau of Control has vanished – just as the FBC’s locked-up menagerie of unnatural horrors has escaped into New York. Dylan, under lock and key himself after completing Brainwashed Baddie duty in the first game, is thusly hired by the FBC’s shadowy Board to find their missing executive and maybe help clean up the mess outside if it’s not too much trouble, thanks.</p> <figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1_eZyFM5-4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Judging by the trailer, Control Resonant’s combat is still of the fast-paced, dashing and levitating variety. Dylan’s fighting style, however, appears completely gun-free, instead revolving around the Aberrant: a shimmering metal bar that can transform into various melee weapons. Be they twin swords, a chunky spear, or the most physics-defyingly vast warhammer you’ll see outside of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>. It’s also, curiously, something that Jesse herself appears to lamp Dylan with before skedaddling. Know the feeling, mate – my sister once threw a cricket stump at my head.</p>
<p>Remedy say that Control Resonant will have a wider variety of moves and powers to learn than in the original, and that it’ll lean further into its RPG side by having you commit to skill builds with fewer opportunities to backtrack. As for who you’ll be biffing, I spy some familiar crimson-skinned Hiss types from Control and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, though the big bads are "a new threat that can reshape the very fabric of our reality." I like the idea of going toe-to-magic-stick with a broader range of otherworldly hostiles; glimpsing some of the contained oddities within Control’s Oldest House made for both strong worldbuilding and interesting sidequests, but when violence broke out, it was usually just against red blokes with guns.</p><p>I’m less sure of the setting, and of playing as Dylan specifically. Manhattan does seem rich with opportunities to pull it apart in dramatic ways, but then what we’ve seen so far is mostly just Inception high-rise kaleidoscoping, with little of the distinct visual identity that the brutalist Oldest House provided. Dylan, meanwhile, spent most of Control being mindfudged into snarling threats from a box, while the likeably awkward Jesse went off to have fun masonry-throwing fights. Still, maybe Control Resonant can be a redemption arc for the Faden family fuckup.</p>

<p>Capcom have confirmed the return of Leon Kennedy in a new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at this year's Geoff Awards, ahead of the horror game's release on February 27th, 2026. The trailer in question gives us a quick look at his capabilities compared to Requiem's new protagonist Grace. Perhaps needless to say, he's of the shootier persuasion, versus what we've seen of Grace's skulking and cowering. Here you go, pop your head through the paragraph break and have a gander. I promise it won't get bitten off.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, some Playstation Store cover art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">leaked Kennedy's presence in Requiem</a> ahead of time, answering arguably the biggest burning question that's been buzzing around the horror flick for most of this year. That followed some Gamestop listing leaks mentioning that the game's deluxe edition add-ons included outfits for Rosemary Winters, daughter of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> protagonist Ethan Winters.</p>
<p>Resi Requiem's first proper trailer debuted at Geoff Fest this summer, with Edwin subsequently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-has-its-own-version-of-lady-dimitrescu-but-i-doubt-youll-be-thirsting-for-this-hag">catching a hands-off presentation</a> and being spooked by a monster which managed to remind him of Lady Dimitrescu despite it crawling around on the ceiling like a Xenomorph. [Look, the two aren't mutually exclusive - Ed]</p><p>"The question is whether this is a quarantined Maximum Terror episode in a game of frenzied Resi 4-style crowd control and upgradeable weapons," he wrote at the time. "Our PR handler took care to combine the words “horror” and “action” during the demo presentation, leaving the ratio unclear, but the marketing catchphrase "addicting fear" suggests that this might be one of the spookier, less trigger-happy Resis."</p>
<p>Had your fill of evil residents? Right, on to more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a> it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not expecting anything from the latest <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-andrew-schulz-dan-hibiki-cast-1851785220"><em>Street Fighter</em> movie</a>, but the first trailer actually has me a little excited. It looks like its having fun with the star-studded cast playing a ridiculous roster of SNES-era fighting game characters.</p> <p>It’s a brief trailer that doesn’t really tell us too much about the film’s story. Out October 16, 2026,<em> Street Fighter</em> sees Ryu and Ken recruited into the 1993 World Warrior Tournament by Chun-Li. From there they get emmeshed in a “deadly conspiracy.” What we get from this new sneak peak is more of a taste of how each character will look in the franchise’s latest live-action adaptation and how some of the fight choreography will work.</p>

 <p>Take a look:</p>  <p>As a reminder, here’s the full cast list. <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-cast-actors-50-cent-jason-momoa-1851785178">It’s bizarre</a>, but it might just work:</p> <ul> <li>Noah Centineo&nbsp;as&nbsp;Ken Masters</li> <li>Andrew Koji&nbsp;as&nbsp;Ryu</li> <li>Jason Momoa&nbsp;as&nbsp;Blanka</li> <li>Roman Reigns&nbsp;as&nbsp;Akuma</li> <li>Callina Liang&nbsp;as&nbsp;Chun-Li</li> <li>Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson&nbsp;as&nbsp;Balrog</li> <li>Andrew Schulz&nbsp;as&nbsp;Dan Hibiki</li> <li>David Dastmalchian&nbsp;as&nbsp;M. Bison</li> <li>Cody Rhodes&nbsp;as&nbsp;Guile</li> <li>Vidyut Jammwal&nbsp;as&nbsp;Dhalsim</li> <li>Eric André&nbsp;as Don Sauvage</li> <li>Orville Peck&nbsp;as&nbsp;Vega</li> <li>Olivier Richters&nbsp;as&nbsp;Zangief</li> <li>Hirooki Goto&nbsp;as&nbsp;E. Honda</li> <li>Mel Jarnson&nbsp;as&nbsp;Cammy</li> <li>Rayna Vallandingham&nbsp;as&nbsp;Juli</li> <li>Alexander Volkanovski&nbsp;as&nbsp;Joe</li> <li>Kyle Mooney&nbsp;as Marvin</li> </ul> <p>The movie is clearly leaning into its retro ’90s nostalgia and doesn’t seem to be taking itself too seriously. It looks a little more self-aware than the original 1994 movie. That one was an absolute mess, though it remains a charming artifact of its era. And in keeping with the ’90s theme, <em>Street Fighter</em> arrives the same year as the next <em>Mortal Kombat</em> movie, because all SNES-era homages deserve a proper console rivalry.</p>

<p>The next chapter for Lara Croft has been revealed at The Game Awards in <strong>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</strong>. The game, set to release in 2027, brings the iconic archeologist to Northern India to discover ancient secrets.</p>



<p>Released in 1996, the Tomb Raider franchise has become one of the most recognizable video game series ever. Starring the titular Lara Croft, players are taken across the globe in search of archaeological treasures of mystical proportions. From the ruins of Atlantis to the jungles of Paititi, the globetrotting archeologist has been through a lot. Fans have been anxiously awaiting a new entry since 2018’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tomb-raider-games-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>, especially after a look at a redone Lara Croft a few years back. Finally, after being teased <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier in the week</a>, Tomb Raider is headed to uncharted territory in a new title.</p>







<p>This story is currently in development and will be updated once more information is available.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, which premiered at The Game Awards, fans get a look at the next mainline title, called Tomb Raider: Catalyst. We see Lara Croft battling a mysterious enemy in India. She sports her twin pistols and her signature acrobatic moves. As of now, the game is expected to release in 2027 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 has kicked off with a new release date for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, with the title arriving on May 29, 2026</p>



<p>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight was announced earlier this year during Gamescom 2025, and you can check out Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a> for the title here. The developers had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that they would be present during The Game Awards, and they really made us feel their presence. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The developers recently revealed that they pulled up references to all Batman movies and TV shows, such as Batman: The Animated Series, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and more. They also read every comic they could get their hands on and had access to the DC Comics archive for this project. From there, they started writing down the key, essential, and iconic moments, which became the starting point for LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>The game features a young Bruce Wayne, playing around Wayne Manor, excited to go to the movies with his parents. We then see the character visit the League of Shadows to train and eventually return to Gotham City as the Caped Crusader. You end up making allies with Jim Gordon, Catwoman, Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl, who are playable characters and come with their specific abilities.</p>



<p>The game will also have you face iconic villains like The Joker, The Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Bane, and more, as well as many other gangs of enemies. Players will have access to a new combat system to take these enemies down, which includes combining combos, stealth techniques, and detective skills. Gotham City is also more immersive than ever, featuring crimes, challenges, rewards, secrets, and iconic landmarks such as Arkham Asylum, Ace Chemicals, and Wayne Tower.</p>







<p>In other news, LEGO Batman: Legacy’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-open-world-arkham-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world is larger</a> than the Arkham Knight.

            <p>A from the ground up remake of the original Tomb Raider has been announced at The Game Awards.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/major-tomb-raider-announcement-leaks-ahead-of-the-game-awards">leaked earlier today</a>, this remake is known as Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis. It places players back in the shoes of Lara Croft as she hops from country to country in search of the Scion of Atlantis. </p>

<p>Unlike the original game and the remastered collection that was released last year, this version of the first Tomb Raider has a certain cinematic 'Uncharted-ness' to it.
</p>
<p>Lara, meanwhile, has had a bit of a makeover, with her character model in Legacy of Atlantis sporting the classic tank top and short shorts look, but with the jade necklace first introduced in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot. You can see how it all looks in the new Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis trailer below.</p>

<p>"Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is a stunning reimagining of the 1996 genre-defining game," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>"As Lara Croft, harness your wits and athleticism to explore exotic locations lost to time—from the jungles of Peru to the ancient ruins of Greece, the deserts of Egypt, and a mysterious Mediterranean island shrouded in myth. Traverse treacherous landscapes, solve deadly contraptions, and face lethal predators as you hunt for the scattered pieces of the Scion, an artifact of immeasurable power.</p><p>"Whether you're a veteran raider or new to Lara's world, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis delivers jaw-dropping visuals powered by Unreal Engine 5, modern game design, and new surprises, while honoring the spirit and atmosphere of Lara Croft's debut adventure."</p>
<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is set for a release in 2026.</p>
<p>Along with the remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> entry with Amazon. It's known as Catalyst, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">and we got a little look at it this evening</a>. </p>

            <p>Crystal Dynamics and Amazon's all new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider game</a> has, after years of waiting, finally been revealed.</p>
<p>It is known as Tomb Raider: Catalyst, and as previously rumoured sees a more mature Lara Croft back on her globe-spanning adventures, this time popping over to India for a spot of tomb raiding.</p>
<p>A new trailer, which you can see below, shows Lara using her dual pistols, which makes me very happy.</p>

<p>As for Tomb Raider more generally, in addition to today's game announcement, Amazon also has a live-action TV series in the works, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series-has-found-its-lara-croft">with Sophie Turner set to play Lara</a>. Earlier this week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver was also in talks to star in the show</a>, which is due to begin filming next month.</p>

		<p>Capcom has shared a fresh trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> at The Game Awards revealing more of the story and the character Doctor Victor Gideon. We also get confirmation – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/09/playstation-store-leaks-that-leon-kennedy-will-be-in-resident-evil-requiem/">not that we needed it</a> – that Leon will be in the game and he’s a playable character.</p>
<p>The story will intertwine the stories of Leon and Grace, with Grace’s section being tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil 9 Requiem Leon Reveal Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0oAeG3Ly0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy. Without the series stalwarts at its heart, we’re getting back to much more horror than action of some entries.</p>
<p>As was eventually the case for Resident Evil Village, Requiem will feature both first person and third person gameplay from the off, looking to make the most of the RE Engine’s latest iteration. I found that really changed the tone of the action when going hands on earlier this year.</p>

<p>I said in our preview, “Resident Evil Requiem promises another new beginning for the iconic horror franchise, but it’s still one that’s deeply tied to the series’ past. There’s plenty of tropes here, plenty of references back to the original games, and gameplay ideas that will be familiar, but from my brief hands on with the game, there’s still so, so much to be excited about.”</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of announcing their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/sony-bad-robot-games-the-designer-of-left-4-dead-are-making-a-new-co-op-shooter/">partnership with Sony</a>, Bad Robot Games and their CCO Mike Booth (of Left 4 Dead creating fame) have announced 4:Loop.</p>
<p><iframe title="4:LOOP - The Game Awards 2025 Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6-5ieEtmgTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in a world where Earth has been effectively frozen in place by some kind of alien invasion, 4:Loop is a tactical four-player co-op shooter that will send your team out there to try and defeat the bad monsters time and time again. You’ll lose, you’ll learn, you’ll try again with different character builds, and all the rest.</p>
<p>It’s not been said in quite so many words, but this seems to be a run-based roguelite style of game, and there’s certainly some shades of Returnal.</p>
<p>In development for PS5 and PC, you can sign up to <a href="https://play4loop.badrobotgames.com/signup/playtester">take part in playtests here</a>.</p>
