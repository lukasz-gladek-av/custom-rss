		<p>After playing John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, I was left doubting my knowledge of the legendary filmmaker’s back catalogue. Was there a zombie-filled Toxic Commando from the mid-80s that he had created? Was this zombie shooter from Saber a licensed reimagining or spiritual sequel? Well, no. While this game is inspired by the tone of some of John Carpenter’s filmography, and a title that’s probably reminding me of Toxic Avenger, this is an original creation. John does love blowing up zombies, though… so it’s a good thing that he’ll get to do just that while playing the game branded with his own name!</p>
<p><iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Gameplay Trailer | Opening Night Live 2025 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvdY54M0x5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been consumed by an outbreak of zombie with glowing eyes, and some chap named Leon is trying to fight back against this. The only problem is he needs some supplies and he can’t get them himself, so why not cook up a way that people on the brink of infection themselves can head out and do this for him? Just slap some glowy blue things on their chest to stall the infection’s progression, and they’ll be good to go!</p>


<p>Of course, we know what a Saber Interactive zombie game entails, and that’s some giant hordes of zombies, but the most tangible difference between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/27/world-war-z-aftermath-review-wwz-ps5-xbox-series-x/">World War Z</a> and Toxic Commando is that you’re presented with more open mission areas, instead of linear levels.</p>
<p>After selecting from a handful of classes and character builds, loadouts and all the usual co-op shooter things, we dropped into an overcast, heavily wooded region to do a bit of Leon’s bidding. The first job was finding and neutralising two hotspots marked on the map, and there’s plenty of options available for you to do so. You can naturally just hoof it on foot, but vehicles are also a great option, whether that’s a basic sedan with half the squad hanging out of its windows blasting away at zombies, or a heavily armoured hummer with a mounted machine gun on top to use.</p>


<p>It feels like a little bit of MudRunner and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/roadcraft-review/">RoadCraft</a> has been fed into the game here, albeit in a light and friendly fashion. The hummer is relatively slow, but weaving through the world’s dangers has a slow and methodical feel to it. You also have a tow cable that can be attached to certain fixed points to pull the car up, or to pull open hidden resource caches.</p>
<p>There’s more than just basic zombies to worry about, though they do pack a decent punch when a few of them manage to close the distance to you. A handful of special infected can make an appearance, including some familiar archetypes, but there’s also these mysterious red tendrils that burrow through the earth, block of some paths as they sprout, and can also shoot at you if given the chance.</p>
<p>Reaching a hot spot means fighting to clear the region and completing a mini objective. This could be filling up a generator with gas to activate some kind of gizmo, or blasting away at weak points on some kind of hard shell, eventually revealing a spiky node that you need to approach and rip apart.</p>

<p>With the nodes broken, our search was narrowed to a church in the region, St Goddard’s, but it’s clearly massively in distress as a huge horde of zombies is coming right down on it. Thankfully a massive energy blast is able to buy its defenders some time, but then you have to place defences, man turrets and tackle a fresh wave of zombies coming from all directions.</p>
<p>This is where the World War Z of it all really comes to the fore. You have just a handful of Spare Parts resource points to put towards defences, though you can find more by exploring the map more fully and finding secret caches. At the same time, there’s resource points dotted around that let you spend this same precious resource to open up some class-specific crates or get you new weapons.</p>

<p>It’s four player co-op, so it absolutely makes sense that there’s four classes, loosely in the vein of a Battlefield. The Medic is pretty self explanatory, while the Operator is great for fixing up things, Strike all about damage dealing, and the Defender is able to put down shields for allies. We didn’t really delve too deeply into these archetypes in the single level we played, but there will be the ability to advance and upgrade each of these, alongside weapons and customisable vehicles, to push down different player builds.</p>
<p>Back to the task at hand and the waves come en masse from three directions, one at a time. Instead of arming electric traps and putting up barriers, I’ve gone further ahead to hop onto a mounted machine gun, splitting my attention between blasting away at the ridge line and checking other flanks for any sneaky surprises that the game might be trying to spring on us – and there were a few! It’s still genuinely impressive to see the vast hordes of zombies just flowing over a cliff, down a hill, pilling up and over a fence and then rushing forward, and it’s obvious why this has become a staple of Saber’s games over the past few years –&nbsp;this and trucks with tow cables!</p>

<p>This game is clearly another love letter to the co-op zombie shooter, taking Saber’s established technologies and wrapping it up in a new setting that’s infused with grungey 80s action movie schlock. You get to blast tons of zombies, though, and that’s probably just what John Carpenter ordered.</p>

<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158249/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Cast your minds back, if you're still able, to the year of our lord 2022 and the release of Moral Anxiety Studio's <em>tremendous</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>. Yes, you know the one, that PC game you may not have played but certainly heard plenty about, as it garnered a whole bunch of Very Nice Reviews™.</p>
<p>And here, to be blunt, is another for the pile. What's the point in mincing words? Who has time in this economy? Roadwarden is a special game, you see, one of those that stays with you long after the fact of having played it. It's been compared, and rightly so, to the likes of the also-rather-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disco_elysium_the_final_cut">Disco Elysium</a>, in how it creates an unflinching world that's absolutely dripping in atmosphere and tiny details, a world that's stuffed to the gills with meaningful encounters, fascinating conversations and choices that embed you in it all. Right up to your eyeballs, my friends.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158250/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Telling the tale of a roadwarden — that's the name given to hardy folk who establish new routes through dangerous territory — the game sets you the task of investigating the disappearance of your predecessor, whilst also engaging in quests and missions for local folk. You arrive at your destination as the game begins, and set out into an uncharted, and apparently quite monster-riddled, peninsula. And, before you can catch a breath, you'll have overburdened yourself with favours for locals and errands you don't have time for, if you're anything like me.</p>
<p>It's a narrative setup that hooks you immediately, partly because the setting and story are atmospheric and engaging to begin with, but chiefly because the writing here is top-drawer stuff. You begin to see how the comparisons to Disco Elysium are so easy to make; it has that level of quality in its conversations and the situations and predicaments in which it places you.</p>
<p>Now, just because I said 'Disco Elysium' a bunch of times, don't go expecting some detective noir thing either. This is much more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher</a> in its setting and tone. Indeed, in my silly old brain, I am playing a sort of Witcher character in my runthrough. You know the type: gruff, quietly brave, intensely handsome...that sort of thing. Very tight pants.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158246/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, as an RPG of the text-based variety, Roadwarden is much more heavy on the old reading and not so much on the intense action, so it's a good thing the writing is so strong across the board. In fact, the story here, with much less interactivity, would have suited me fine. However! Moral Anxiety Studio has gone much further. You've got big decisions to make and tight time restrictions. It's stressful being a roadwarden.</p>
<p>On the default difficulty setting, you've got 40 days to solve the core mystery and...well...sort of organically be yourself and see what happens. Seriously. There's no wrong way to do this one. Pick what's important to you and work towards it. There's also a casual mode that removes the day counter, as well as a harder mode for returning players.</p>
<p>There's more interactivity than you may expect kicking things off in Roadwarden, too, with a choice of classes for your character, each one presenting you with different abilities and conversational choices, so there's a ton of replayability built in for folk who gel with what's here. I've gone with a mage for my review run, but there's also a fighter and a scholar in there, so you can imagine on a basic level how each of these may differ.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158243/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You also need to consider your health. You have little potions to top up alongside whatever rations you can buy or scavenge, and you'll want to manage rest, maintain your appearance (or people will be rude), and make sure your armour and weaponry are good and ready for any dice-based scraps you encounter whilst picking your way through towns and villages, open countryside and dark forests that feel as alive and full of life as any great big AAA game you may have played this year.</p>
<p>I'm at great pains not to spoil anything of the narrative beyond the fact you are a roadwarden jettisoned into a very engaging adventure, you may be able to tell, and my gosh, it's one that you could potentially play for a very long time. You could read guides and find out how to do everything the 'proper' way, or you could, as I recommend, just give yourself over to it. Don't drop it down to casual, accept the challenge of the 40-day time limit, and watch how it just comes alive. And it comes alive because it allows you to properly inhabit your character, to do as you please and set your own agenda - to a point.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158251/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You've got so much choice in the storylines that you will, by design, have to sacrifice aspects of the character you wish to role-play. The game doesn't allow you, as so many others do, to paint any sort of complete picture on a singular run. With 40 days to achieve your goals, you need to prioritise the mapping out of this dangerous peninsula — that's the reason you're here after all — but there's also your predecessor's disappearance and, by the time you've visited the first town, a million other pressing issues besides.</p>
<p>'Pressing' in an engaging and intriguing way, mind. It's not Ubisoft stress we're talking about here; you're not sweating a missing scroll or collectible, you're sweating missing some entire other storyline, some other fascinating piece of lore, or a situation or encounter that changes things meaningfully.</p>
<p>You'll navigate towards the things you naturally find most intriguing, and this is the real beauty of Roadwarden, and what makes it so special. You'll want to play it. You want to return to it, to find out more, to reveal further. Battles, when they happen, bring your chosen class skills to the fore, and of course dice rolls come into play as well. It all makes for a narrative adventure that feels like a proper, full-blooded RPG adventure. I'm doing rather well at not spoiling anything here, I reckon. Heck, you even get to freely add text in some investigative instances - it really does let you muck about more than you expect, and the result feels gloriously malleable.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158247/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also love the spartan aspect to the pixel illustrations illuminating us along the way. As you reach new locations, the game presents a visual of the room or road or wherever it is that you find yourself. However, these images only give you a glimpse, a guide, to how things are. They aren't populated, there's no real detail, and so you get a sort of atmospheric baseplate — a little nudge in the right direction tonally — upon which you can then paint freely.</p>
<p>With regards to negatives, I only have one bone to pick, and it's that the UI on Switch is a little funky and slow to use. You need to have patience with it at first. As you play, you'll need to choose responses, use your world map to travel to locations, as well as check your health, stats, use your inventory, and so on. Using the Joy-Con, it all feels a bit too unresponsive for me. Not broken or anything like that, just slow. There are touchscreen controls, mercifully, and these work better. However, they still feel a bit more sluggish than they should. It also takes quite a while for the game to load initially, so perhaps there's a little struggling going on somewhere behind the scenes on Switch 1.</p>
<figure><a title="Roadwarden Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158244/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of this issue, though, I feel like Roadwarden is still one of the easiest recommendations I've had to make in ages. It's available for just slightly more than the cost of your lunch (if you eat the same sandwich meal deal as me), and it genuinely delivers in spades the sort of quality that will 100% keep you coming back to try new things, visit new places, and investigate different conversations more deeply.</p>
<p>If you're in line for a deep and addictive text-based RPG adventure, one that's full of great writing, lots of secrets, impactful choices, and fascinating scenarios, step right this way. Just watch out for bandits! And for goodness' sake, wash your face and have a nap.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roadwarden is a fascinating text-based RPG that delivers top-notch writing, meaningful and impactful choices, and way more interactivity than you may be expecting from a game of this type. Managing your time, health, armour, and more as you explore and map out a dangerous peninsula gives you plenty to consider as you pick and choose the narrative threads and situations that concern you most.</p>
<p>Almost impossible to put down, and definitely something I'll play more than once, this is a genre highlight on Switch that's only slightly let down by a bit of clunkiness on the UI front.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-to-launch-on-consoles-roughly-a-year-after-pc-cross-play-will-depend-on-sony-and-microsoft.1280007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>At Gamescom 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-2025-qa-we-just-need-to-keep-working-and-solve-the-problems-we-have-one-of-the-best-survival-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> Dune Awakening Game Director Joel Bylos to discuss the game's launch on PC and the upcoming updates planned for the survival sandbox MMO. Among the various topics, we also inquired about the status of the console versions, which have long been scheduled for release. According to Bylos, the game will debut next year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series, with an internal estimate that it should take around a year.</p>



<p><em>We're working towards a launch on console sometime next year. We've just begun after launch, and started really digging into it. I've seen it running on a PlayStation 5, but there were a lot of texture issues, still a lot of work to do, and then we have to do all the different requirements for the different consoles and optimize the game shaders to work properly with the different console hardware, so there's work to do. We usually assume that it's going to take us about a year to get it up and running properly on a console. So yeah, sometime next year, now, probably we will have one launch at the same time as GTA VI laughs.</em></p>



<p>If so, Dune Awakening could be available on those platforms sometime in the Summer of 2026. Funcom is still unclear whether it will be able to support cross-play, though it would like to:  </p>



<p><em>It's still on the conversations we're having with Microsoft and PlayStation to decide that, so we haven't actually made a decision, but from our technical standpoint, it's no problem for us because we run these servers and the games will connect to our service. So it's not a problem, but it depends on what the platform holders have to say; we need to have those conversations. We haven't had them yet.</em></p>



<p>It should be noted that Microsoft and Sony (PlayStation) haven't really had a problem with cross-play for at least a couple of years. Nowadays, it has become the standard for new online multiplayer games, so if that's the only obstacle, chances are Dune Awakening players will indeed be able to play in the same version of Arrakis.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-has-some-weird-shortcomings-on-console.1280001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> overhauls the storied PS2 game with modern visuals. <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">It plays great on PC</a> but the console experience prior to launch is surprisingly bad. The Konami remake can’t hit a consistent 60fps on PlayStation 5 even in performance mode, and the PS5 Pro enhanced mode is especially disappointing. It might not be enough to ruin the experience but it raises concerns and has some wondering if Konami will be able to meaningfully optimize the console version with subsequent updates.</p> <p>Out August 26 for those who buy the Deluxe Edition, <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> doesn’t really have a 60fps mode on PS5. Instead, it has a max target of 60fps, but spends much of the time dipping far below that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">A Digital Foundry analysis</a> shows it consistently falling to around 45fps in denser jungle areas, or even lower when swimming underwater. Things are even worse on PS5 Pro, where the <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake dispenses with having alternate graphics modes and simply smooshes everything into a single performance boost. But in order to hit higher framerates it uses a lower, sub-1080p image resolution resolution to upscale. The results are pretty grimy.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR WARNING If you’re planning on playing Metal Gear Solid Delta:</p> <p>The game runs terribly, with PS5/XSX rendering 720p-1080p at 30-50FPS in Performance mode</p> <p>The PS5 Pro somehow runs worse &amp; looks blurrier despite using PSSR</p> <p>Another disastrous Unreal Engine 5 release. <a href="https://t.co/Lnha48T2C6">pic.twitter.com/Lnha48T2C6</a></p> <p>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1958820771364532707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Digital Foundry notes that quality mode on PS5 gets players better draw distances for textures and shadows, and improved global illumination for better complex lighting effects, which the jungle-based environment is full of. Unfortunately, despite hitting 30fps most of the time, the quality mode still occasionally buckles below that when blowing up barrels or during the busiest onscreen action sequences. Performance mode is even more inconsistent in terms of framerate, hitting 60fps fine in the starting area but sinking well below that at moments in larger environments. Overall it seems like nothing is quite as smooth as you’d hope or expect for what is essentially an Unreal Engine 5 makeover of an otherwise mostly unchanged PS2 game.</p> <h2><em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake’s PS5 Pro mode is far from perfect</h2> <p>Then there’s the PS5 Pro’s mode which has its own issues. Namely, it’s upscaling from a lower resolution to hit a higher consistent 60fps, leading to even worse visual quality in the distance than on the base PS5’s performance mode. “It’s a win in motion for PS5 Pro with a smarter handling of occlusion artifacts and swaying grass,” Digital Foundry reports. “But if left to settle, the resolved reconstructed image on PS5 Pro seems to struggle to match the clarity of base PS5.” The enhanced mode gets even worse when you account for the PSSR-induced flickering and shimmering effects that PS5 Pro players may remember from <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake.</p> <p>There’s still time to address many of these apparent problems, especially the base PS5 shortcomings, in a day-one patch, though time is running out with the game’s early access launch less than 24 hours away. As for the PS5 Pro experience, well we’ll have to wait and see how that gets addressed in the future. None of the issues surfaced so far seem like deal breakers, but it does suggest anyone who has the option to play<em> Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> on a high-end PC instead should begin there.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Many Developers Still Don’t Have Nintendo Switch 2 Dev Kits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/many-developers-still-dont-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/many-developers-still-don%E2%80%99t-have-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits.1279998/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been out of nearly three months, and it’s been one of the fasted-selling consoles ever since it’s June 5 release. And while Nintendo has released games for it and some third party ports are coming, there is still an issue with other developers not being able to get their games onto the new platform due to a lack of dev kits.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of Digital Foundry’s Direct Weekly show, John Linneman&nbsp;and Oliver Mackenzie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=504s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">spoke about what talks were like</a> at Gamescom in Cologne. Part of those talks were about Nintendo not sending Switch 2 dev kits to a number of developers, including some AAA studios.</p>



<p><strong>“Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I’ve spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” </strong>Linneman said. <strong>“There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things. They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult right now.”</strong></p>



<p>From there, Mackenzie added that he had heard “through the grapevine” and from talking to others that there were “some weird exclusions with some big developers struggling to get kits for games.”</p>



<p><strong>“And there were some weird inclusions as well, like some indies were included which is nice to see,”</strong> Mackenzie said. <strong>“But like there’s that campfire game you know the kind of camera campfire game and they’re getting kits and some big developers on the other hand who developed like AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</strong></p>



<p>None of the studios who haven’t been able to get Switch 2 dev kits were mentioned, but they might be able to be guessed, especially if you want to dig into some larger studios without newer games announced for the platform. That said, fans will have to wait and see how third-party support grows on the console in the coming months and years.</p>



<p>What do you think of studios not being able to get Nintendo Switch 2 dev kits? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite Festival has revealed the featured artist for Season 10: Gorillaz. The rhythmic game mode, part of Fortnite’s game launcher, has been going strong since December 2023. Every season brings a new artist, like Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, and last season’s Bruno Mars. Now, we have confirmation on who is headlining it next with Gorillaz.</p>



<p>The London-based pop band has been going strong since 1998. With 12 Grammy nominations, including one win for Best Pop Collaboration, Gorillaz is no stranger to the limelight. It also helps that the band is fictional, having fake animated bandmates, adding notoriety to their name. They are a natural fit for Fortnite, but that’s not all that’s being added, come it’s rather soon release.</p>



<h2 id="h-gorillaz-headlines-season-10-of-fortnite-festival-starting-august-26th">Gorillaz Headlines Season 10 of Fortnite Festival Starting August 26th</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/gorillaz-enter-a-new-universe-as-fortnite-festival-season-10-icons?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> from Fortnite/Epic Games, Season 10 of Fortnite Festival will launch tomorrow, August 26th. All four band members, Noodle, 2D, Russell, and Murdoc, will be available as Outfits. Noodle and 2D both come with their own Back Blings and weapons and are available until the end of Season 10. In addition, the iconic track “Clint Eastwood” will release onto the shop as a Jam Track. Of course, a new Main Stage has been added, now made to look straight out of a Gorillaz music video.</p>



<p>Patch notes for Fortnite Festival were also revealed in the post. The updates fix some UI issues, as well as sorting in the Main Stage Music Library. The full patch notes can be found below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adding “Good” notes so that it’s clearer in the UI when you’re just short of “Perfect.” (Hitting a note slightly too early or slightly too late.)
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable the “Good” visual feedback in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Adjusting the design of lift notes so that it’s easier to tell when to press and when to let go.
<ul>
<li>You’ll have the option to disable this new design (“Lift Notes Connectors”) in the settings.&nbsp;<strong>(Settings &gt; Game &gt; Festival)</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>In the Main Stage Music Library, you’ll be able to sort by&nbsp;<strong>Song Duration</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Song Intensity</strong>.</li>



<li>You’ll be able to&nbsp;<strong>strum</strong>&nbsp;during the tune-up process, making it easier to test and calibrate your guitar controller.</li>
</ul>

Crueler still, that we should find out with such short notice that <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> will launch just one day after our planned release for <em>Demonschool</em>.</p><p>We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for <em>Demonschool</em> is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red. If the September period is going to be <em>Silksong</em>‘s moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give <em>Demonschool</em> its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully.</p><p>We don’t take this decision lightly. <em>Demonschool</em>‘s release has been delayed before, and we want to be clear: there are no more delays after this point. We’ve already distributed Steam keys to press as part of a healthy review program, and had every intention to proudly release on September 3. We hope fans who anticipated the game will forgive us for one final delay.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Between now and November, Necrosoft Games and ourselves will continue to pour our time into enhancing and polishing up the game experience. For example, there will be more endings and minigames that the developers originally planned to patch in post-release, rather than leave them on the cutting floor; now it’ll all be part of the game’s release in November.</p><p>Thank you for your patience and enthusiasm for <em>Demonschool</em>. We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games’ labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19!</p><p>—Brian Kwek, Ysbryd Games</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-to-november-19]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the world's largest libraries will not consider Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key Cards for preservation.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game-Key Cards solely act as authentication keys, allowing the user to download the full game onto their console when inserted. The card must remain in the system in order to play the game, despite the game being installed, but the card can be shared or resold. Several third-party publishers utilize the medium for their Switch 2 releases, including Capcom, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-key-cards-are-digital-sales-according-to-capcom/1100-6532342/" data-ref-id="1100-6532342">considers its Game-Key Card titles as digital sales</a>.</p><p>Consumers, preservationists, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-game-key-cards-are-a-little-disheartening-for-game-preservation-says-dev/1100-6531262/" data-ref-id="1100-6531262">developers have raised concerns</a> about the format, as ownership of these games is dependent on internet connection and whether Nintendo's eShop and servers are functional. Those concerned cite Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/" data-ref-id="1100-6500734">closure of the Wii U and 3DS eShops in March 2023</a>, which rendered it impossible to purchase titles from those storefronts through any official means. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-wants-to-know-your-thoughts-on-its-divisive-game-key-cards/1100-6533657/" data-ref-id="1100-6533657">Nintendo released a survey this month</a> to its customers asking questions about their preferences for physical games.</p><p>The National Diet Library, comparable to the United States' Library of Congress, has been collecting physical video games since October 2000. The national library's collections, which include books, newspapers, music, maps, and other materials, comprise over 44 million items, making it the eighth-biggest library in the world.</p><p>It's worth noting that the National Diet Library also has an extensive collection of digital materials, including e-books and magazines, but the institution does not include any digital or online-only video games.</p>

<p>A few gameplay adjustments are also coming when the new season drops tomorrow, such as new "Good" notes and changes to the design of lift notes.

<p>Bruno Mars was the most-recent headline for Fortnite Festival, with Sabrina Carpenter, Hatsune Miku, and Metallica among other names that have participated.</p>
<p>So, Gorillaz, then! A big deal for those of us who grew up in the late '90s and early 2000s. We definitely didn't feel our age when we say that Demon Days was 20 years old...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The last Forza Horizon game, Forza Horizon 5, took drivers to Mexico, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-4-take-weather-with-you/">Forza Horizon 4</a> had them racing around the UK countryside. Playground Games and Microsoft have yet to officially say where Forza Horizon 6 will take players, but a deleted Instagram post, a new report, and Tokyo Game Show 2025 seem to have the answer.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/">Forza Horizon 5</a> launched back in 2021, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-forza-horizon-5-continue-support/">despite layoffs in the last month</a>, we're closing in it being high time we heard what's next for the series. A now-deleted Instagram post from car importer Cult and Classic, featuring a Japanese Kei car being photographed for use in the next Forza Horizon game (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-setting-for-the-next-forza-horizon-game-has-seemingly-leaked-via-a-car-company/">VGC</a>), seemingly pointed to Forza Horizon 6 being set in Japan. Especially considering that Kei cars are a model of vehicle that is very rarely found outside of Japan, and is mostly manufactured in Japan.</p>



<p>Now, a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/report-forza-horizon-6-may-be-announced-this-year-in-the-same-place-the-game-is-set">Windows Central</a> adds that there are "<em>official</em>" documents being circulated that confirm the next entry in the Forza Horizon series will be announced at Tokyo Game Show 2025, which is due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-konami-square-enix-and-more-all-confirmed-to-attend-tokyo-game-show-2025/">take place at the end of September</a>. Insider-Gaming's <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339">Tom Henderson</a> and insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1959666173936796128">Nate the Hate</a> both corroborate that they have seen the documents in question, with Nate the Hate adding that he's not seen evidence of a Nintendo Switch 2 version as part of the equation for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can confirm that these documents have been floating around for the last week or so. There's one massively disgruntled employee at Xbox lol <a href="https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom">https://t.co/wLLoT1nVom</a></p>— Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1959683880840999339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If Forza Horizon 6 is indeed set in Japan, then the Tokyo Game Show makes for the perfect stage on which to unveil the next entry in the series. Even more so when you consider the presence that PlayStation has over Xbox in Japan, and the extreme likelihood, if not surefire conclusion, that the next Forza Horizon game will arrive on PlayStation, if not at launch, then perhaps shortly after, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-dominates-playstation-q2-top-10-chart-us/">thanks to the success that Forza Horizon 5 has found on the platform</a>.</p>



<p>We'll see what TGS 2025 has in store.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warzone Getting New Resurgence Map Following Black Ops 7 Launch, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-resurgence-black-ops-7-launch-rumor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warzone-getting-new-resurgence-map-following-black-ops-7-launch-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1279968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resurgence may be getting a new map after Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s release, one rumor claims. The eagerly anticipated next entry in the Call of Duty franchise has many excited, both for the campaign and multiplayer. However, it looks like Warzone fans may have something to look forward to come its November 14th, 2025 launch. </p>



<p>The Resurgence mode in Warzone has been around since Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War back in 2020. It’s been present in both Warzone 1.0 and Warzone 2.0, as well as at launch for Warzone Mobile. The mode is a different take on the typical Battle Royale mode, with more players and heightened intensity plays. So, the rumored new map is sure to get some back into the Resurgence game.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-to-add-extended-liberty-falls-map-during-season-1-of-black-ops-7-says-credible-leaker">Warzone To Add Extended Liberty Falls Map During Season 1 of Black Ops 7, Says Credible Leaker</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a tweet from credible Call of Duty leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1960001313422659979">TheGhostofHope</a>, they state that they have learned a new Resurgence map is in the works. Furthermore, it appears to be an extended version of Liberty Falls. The map, which debuted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 as a Zombies level, is a rather interesting choice. Still, given TheGhostofHope’s track record, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">Black Ops 7’s release date</a>, there’s a strong chance we may hear about it soon. </p>



<p>Currently, the Multiplayer reveal for Black Ops 7 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">slated to happen</a> on September 30th, 2025. As the rumor ties to Season 1 of the upcoming shooter, it’s more than likely we’ll get confirmation there. Until then, fans can get into Resurgence in Warzone and practice before the new map comes along.</p>



<p>What do you think about Liberty Falls being the next Resurgence map in Warzone? Was there one you think deserved it more? Let us know in the comments and on the forums. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Amongst my many, many silly ideas, becoming a farmer has to rank pretty high amongst them. My long-suffering partner will roll their eyes out of their sockets when I talk about growing crops, herding the sheep in and working outside, not least because I have zero experience in this field. But not anymore! If Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is anything to go by, I’ll be very good at being a farmer, not least because I’m willing to push myself to the point of exhaustion, I’ll work in torrential rain, and because a lot of your time seems to be spent chatting.</p>
<p><iframe title="STORY OF SEASONS: Grand Bazaar – Cozy Living Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEr-kUsGhiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is both thoroughly new, and thoroughly old, standing as a remake of Harvest Moon DS: Grand Bazaar, a Nintendo DS entry in the series from a time before you could pluck controllers off the side of your console. As all Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon games go, you’ve been given a farm, but it’s mostly full of weeds and rocks, rather than anything you would want to eat. It’s then up to you to tidy the place up, fill it with crops, nurture some of the cutest cows and chickens in gaming and, if you’re lucky, find a husband or wife to spend your farming days with.</p>


<p>In and of itself, that’s plenty of fun for the cosy gamer, but there’s still the Grand Bazaar part of the title to deal with. Your farm is part of a small town that’s a little down on its luck, with the blame firmly laid at the entrance of its failing weekly market. Alongside all the work you have to do for your farm and for your prospective love life, you’re also tasked with revitalising the Bazaar, running your own market stall each week, as well as trying to attract new merchants and entrepreneurs to fill out its empty plots.</p>


<p>If that all sounds like a lot, it is. Time runs especially fast in Grand Bazaar, with each day lasting around ten minutes. In that space of time you will find yourself running around town like a sickle-wielding maniac, desperately trying to talk to or greet every potential love interest, nurture your crops, cuddle your pets, milk the cows, groom the alpacas, shear the sheep, go mining, trim the weeds, collect some flowers, hand out gifts, craft items, go fishing, visit the shops, complete some side quests, and a bunch of other things, all while planning out what you have to do in the next day, or week, ready for the impending punctuation point of the weekly market. If you’re like me, that’s a heady and utterly engrossing mix of busy work, but there’s some clear repetition to those tasks that might not fit with other people.</p>
<p>The growth of your town eases some of that repetition, alongside the occasionally enlightening and often pointed conversations with the townsfolk, through to the semi-regular events that crop up, ranging from pet and crop shows to competitive showjumping events. Besides that, the focus of upgrading your tools, or setting yourself to a particular villager request, means that there are times where you have to step away from your usual routine, and these bring enough change to the formula to keep things interesting.</p>
<p>Your level of activity is limited by your stamina bar. Every major action, like tilling the fields, harvesting crops or mining, takes its toll on your body, and like a regular human being you’ll soon become tired. You can alleviate this by eating a meal, or taking a refreshing shower, but you always need to be aware of pushing yourself too far. Story of Seasons is relatively realistic in that sense, with overwork eventually causing you to collapse, or a late night then causing you to oversleep the next day. Broadly, there’s a lot to juggle each day, and the tight time and stamina constraints mean you can’t ever rest too easily.</p>

<p>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar is horribly addictive, once it’s sunk its crop-clearing sickle into you. I was supposed to play other games this last week, and instead I played Story of Seasons. I was supposed to go out, but instead I played Story of Seasons. Any number of things, including eating, were postponed because I was playing Story of Seasons. I’m not entirely sure it is actually a cosy game, given how far it sinks itself into your psyche and how much of it becomes about doing a job. I think it’s probably more of a farming sim than this year’s Farming Simulator, just with cute graphics, and I have been entirely won over by it.</p>
<p>Visually, it’s not pushing the Switch 2 all that far, but the bright, vibrant art design shines through, and the characters all look and feel like distinct people, aided by the additional artwork that can accompany each conversation. Oddly, you can make the frame rate stutter a tiny bit here and there, generally when you’re using your handy glider to get around, but it doesn’t affect gameplay at all, and one of the joys of the game becomes using the little cut-throughs or jumping across the roofs of houses on your way across town.</p>

<p>The only complaint with Grand Bazaar remains from the original version of the game, which is the annoyances of having three different windmills to craft items in, and having to run between the three of them as you attempt to craft the most lucrative items. Some of that has been lightened by the sprite boxes which let you transport yourself and items around the town, but it does feel like there might still be a better way to ease some of that busy work.</p>

That’s literally the whole point of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, the anime-inspired musical phenomenon that is </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>approaching the top of Netflix’s most-streamed movies of all time</span></a><span>. Its titular trio of demon-slaying songstresses are the latest in a long line of hunters masquerading as a pop act, using the power of their fans’ souls, ignited by their melodies, to push demons back to their hellish prison. A series of limited singalong screenings is both the natural conclusion to its entire thematic foundation, and a correction for the boneheaded business deals that sequestered a truly stunning animated musical to a streaming service.</span></p> <p><span>All that said, I was admittedly pretty underwhelmed with the showing I went to. I dragged my roommate and a visiting friend up from Brooklyn to the Alamo Drafthouse in Lower Manhattan dressed in Huntr/x t-shirts, with my friend having styled her hair to look like rapper Zoey’s signature buns in the film. We’d seen videos of the early screenings at Netflix’s theater in Los Angeles and heard a choir of fans, from adult cosplayers to young children, belting out every song, so we were prepared for a mini-concert to the backdrop of </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ stunning visuals. What we got was, well, not that.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620030">© Photo by Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The three of us were in the back row of one of Alamo’s smaller theaters as the host of the event tried her damndest to get the crowd more hyped, and Alamo should give that girl a raise for the work she was putting in. Despite the overwhelmingly adult crowd, the few kids were still the most excited to be there. It was pretty clear based on the adult to kid ratio that most of the crowd had not been dragged there by a child who had probably watched Huntr/x’s literal stan war on loop for the past two months, but even so, a lot of them were not playing into the show. They picked up their swag bag of ramen cups and photo cards of their bias, or favorite member of either Huntr/x or the Saja Boys, but the spirit of a singalong wasn’t flowing through the room. Maybe when the film actually started things would pick up? Nope.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGsevnbItdU"><span>“How It’s Done,”</span></a><span> the opening song in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>,</span> <span>is exactly the song that would tell you if the a singalong audience understood the assignment. The fast-paced, rap-heavy tune is so full of swagger and attitude that anyone who was going to sing should have been singing the second Rumi came in with an exhausted sigh and said “you came at a bad time” while the distorted guitar played underneath her. Our fellow moviegoers, however, did not. As the girls started rapping, my friend and I noticed that we were pretty much the only ones singing above a whisper. Yeah, I belted out “fit check for my napalm era” at the top of my lungs to the ceiling through cupped hands, but it quickly became clear the audience we were with was not passing the vibe check.</span></p> <p><span>To view the situation charitably, it can be hard to get past the established social contract of a movie theater even when you’re told that you’re allowed to be rowdy. Most establishments play a whole video telling you to sit down, shut up, and turn your damn phone off before every movie they play. To Alamo’s credit, they had a video before the show that was like, “Turn the fuck up. Queen out. Power the Honmoon.” Well, if the world had been relying on the crowd in my theater, the demons would have overrun Manhattan by dinner time. Maybe if my friend and I had refused to be silenced by a bunch of quiet curmudgeons, a rising tide would have lifted all ships, but everyone else’s relative silence made it awkward. I’ve been to movie experiences like </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> where the crowd was absolutely losing their shit, and I guess we were just dealt a bad hand this time around.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620031">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At a certain point, my friend and I were mostly just singing along softly in our seats. By the time the bubble-gum sweetness of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=983bBbJx0Mk">“Soda Pop”</a> began and no one was losing their shit about the demon boy band Saja Boys, it became clear to me and my friend that we were the only ones who were really buying into what we paid for, and everyone else was mostly just there to see the movie. This is valid because for most of us, this was the first time any of us had seen the film on the big screen. That’s still a mind-boggling shame.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Still, even with my lukewarm crowd, seeing the movie in a theater cemented how bonkers it is that Sony was so unsure about the movie–which has now become a cultural phenomenon and whose music has hit </span><a href="https://www.billboard.com/lists/huntrx-golden-kpop-demon-hunters-number-1-hot-100/"><span>#1 on the Billboard top 100</span></a><span>–that it partnered with Netflix, who shouldered much of the film’s budget for exclusive rights to distribute it. Sony </span><a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1941507/sony-made-netflix-kpop-demon-hunters-earnings/"><span>ensured it would make a profit</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>through the deal, but lost out on what could have been an absolute cash cow for it down the line.</span></p> <p><span>Even after all the hype and the massive viewer numbers, the people behind the movie still seem to be underestimating it. The Alamo Drafthouses in New York City had four total singalong showings, two on Saturday, August 23, and two more on the following Sunday. Those predictably sold out within days, and by the time my group left our underwhelming screening, Alamo Drafthouse had added another half a dozen to the schedule.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><span>Because the gremlin in my brain is still singing this movie’s soundtrack, I put my Alamo Drafthouse membership to good use and decided to use it to go see the movie again the following day for no additional cost. Worst case scenario, I get to see a movie I really love on the big screen again. Best case scenario, I find a crowd that will match my freak. I picked a showing with more seats, thus statistically more likely to have sickos, but while it was marginally better, I still felt like most of the audience wasn’t buying in, and I didn’t even have my friend with me this time as a buffer. I still yelled “fit check for my napalm era” and sang to myself in my seat, but with the exception of one young diva who not only sang every song but recited every line, it felt like the singalong event was mostly just another chance to see a movie the way it should have been seen in the first place. It’s a shame that I scroll through my feeds and see videos of the most hype crowds singing along at screenings elsewhere and get FOMO for an event I was literally in attendance for, but at least I got the transcendent experience of hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug_pv5-r1js">“What It Sounds Like”</a> booming through the Drafthouse’s sound system.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000620029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620029">© Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There was a guy sitting next to me at the second showing who told his friends he’d only seen the first half of the movie in passing, so he braved a singalong event to see the movie for the first time on the big screen. As much as I enjoyed watching </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>on my laptop, I’m always going to envy his experience of seeing it for the first time in that environment. There’s an entire subplot in </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>about Rumi, the half human/half demon lead singer, being told by her caretaker Celine that she must cover up her demonic patterns and hide who she is from the world, and even her best friends. No one could possibly understand, Celine says, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. That same unsure reservation is why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ victory lap of finally getting to be on the big screen is happening months after it’s already etched itself on our culture as much more than a limited-time event. Much like Celine herself, maybe some people at Sony should have had more faith in what they were making. And maybe by the time the eventual sequel comes out, New York City’s moviegoers will step the fuck up and sing along next time.</span></p>

<p>"Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Party Jamboree + Shawn Layden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf55cf7fa7ae1/mario-party-jamboree-plus-shawn-layden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shawn Layden, formerly the President and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America and Executive Vice President and COO of Sony Network Entertainment International, has come out in praise of Nintendo for being the most in-touch with its fan base.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD0gJdspbqo&amp;ab_channel=HipHopGamer">HipHopGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/former-playstation-boss-says-no-one-is-in-touch-with-their-fan-base-more-than-nintendo-and-even-sony-was-never-this-in-touch-with-what-players-wanted/">GamesRadar+</a>), Layden says that the reason Nintendo hasn't suffered from the same amount of slowdown as other publishers post-Covid is because the company has "been very intentional in what lane they play in," by specifically focusing on "who their fans are and what their fans want."</p>
<p>Layden believes that "No one is more in touch with their fan base than Nintendo. Even PlayStation was never this in touch with the fan base as Nintendo is" and that as gaming sales and revenues climbed during the pandemic, other publishers decided to chase the "curve" by hiring more people.</p>
<p>When lockdown restrictions ended, however, Layden says that Nintendo anticipated the drop-off: "They stayed on course. They had their plan. They're moving their plan. So they didn’t have to suffer the peaks and valleys so much as if you're chasing the opportunity."</p>
<p>"They just know what their opportunity is. They see it. They understand it better than anyone else. And they go for it and they do it really well." You can watch the full interview below.</p>

<p>Of course, whether you agree with Layden's opinion is another thing, but the Switch 2 is delivering early days with multiple genres and returning icons. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a> is due to launch this year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> saw DK return in his first-grand new game in over a decade, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> is a surprise sequel to a GameCube favourite, so we'll see whether this continues into the new console's life.</p>

			<p>From a gamer's perspective, there's no need for the PlayStation 6 or Xbox next-generation system, according to Final Fantasy XIV's director Naoki Yoshida.</p>



<p>Asked about the next generation of consoles and the possibility of Final Fantasy XIV launching on them in a fresh interview posted on <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">Feed4Gamer</a>, Yoshi-P confirmed there's always the possibility of the game launching on new platforms, as his aim is to make the game accessible to as many players as possible. With recent platforms coming with very high specs, the team's work is considerably easier than in the past, so any new hardware release is definitely a positive in this regard. From a gamer's perspective, however, there's no need of the PlayStation 6 and the Xbox next-generation system, Yoshi-P added. Right now, the Final Fantasy XIV director feels that people are happy with the current-generation systems, highlighting how the price of new hardware likely plays a factor in this sentiment.</p>



<p>Besides talking about the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox, Naoki Yoshida also touched upon PlayStation 4 support for Final Fantasy XIV, which will continue for as long as possible, although there will inevitably come a time when support for the previous generation system will be dropped, mostly due to the console's OS and hardware regulations that limit data, which are already making plenty of games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">Genshin Impact</a> drop support for previous generation hardware. So far, Sony Interactive Entertainment has increased these limits for Final Fantasy XIV as per the team's requests, but they have already informed the developers that they are reaching their limits from their side, so the end of support for the PlayStation 4 version of the popular MMORPG may be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Although many may not feel the need for the PlayStation 6 and next-generation Xbox, as Naoki Yoshida highlighted, there's no denying that the next console generation promises to be one of the most interesting in decades, as both Sony and Microsoft seem to be heading into different directions. While Microsoft seems to be going for a modular design offering<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/"> flexibility that will compete more with pre-built gaming PCs</a>, Sony will reportedly release a home console delivering up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">10 times the ray tracing performance of the base PlayStation 5</a> and a handheld capable of running current generation games natively.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>producer Yoshi-P has declared that while he wants to keep supporting the MMORPG on PS4 for "as long as possible", technical limitations might mean the game drops support for the platform eventually.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an interview</a> with Feed4Gamers, Yoshi-P says that his "basic stance" is to continue supporting hardware "which has grown old", but that Sony's "hardware regulations" might make it difficult for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>to remain on the last-gen console.</p>

<p>According to Yoshi-P, the game's continuous updates mean that Square Enix has been asking Sony to increase its data limits for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>specifically, and while Sony has been happy to oblige, the company has told Yoshi-P and his team that "they are also reaching their limits", he says.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-support-yoshi-p-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=GgiuZSw0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-support-yoshi-p-valigarmanda.jpg?itok=0jiJpx0z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>might not be on PS4 for much longer.</figcaption></figure><p>Yoshi-P says that his goal is to keep&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>on as many platforms as possible for as long as he can, but that eventually, last-gen hardware will reach "its limits in terms of its technology".</p>

<p>However, when that time comes, Yoshi-P promises that he will "provide clear reasoning for that decision", so if and when PS4 support does end for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, you'll know about it.</p>

<p>This discussion comes after a couple of prominent games recently ended support for the PS4; earlier this month, HoYoverse declared that PS4 support for gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">will end next year</a>, and&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">subsequently followed suit</a> for its battle royale shooter.</p>

<p>In both cases, the studios said they wanted to focus on current-gen hardware for their games, and that's something for which Yoshi-P seems grateful too; in the aforementioned interview, he says current-gen hardware is "quite high spec" and that working with it is "easier...compared to back in the days".</p>




<p>This interview comes shortly after the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.3</a> for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, which brought a brand new story dungeon, the second part of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XI</em>-themed 24-person raid, and more earlier this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>developer Sad Cat Studios has revealed that work on the game is still very much underway, and that it's now due to launch sometime in spring next year.</p>

<p>In a new development update, project lead Yura Zhdanovich acknowledges that&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>&nbsp;has "seen a couple of delays", but he says that he and his team have always "been trying to do what's best for the project".</p>

<p>Zhdanovich says that he and Sad Cat Studios are "really close to finishing production" on&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, and that the next phase is "intense testing and polishing of the game", although he doesn't say exactly how long he expects that phase to take.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=ETJFF9v8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/replaced-spring-2026-gas-station.jpg?itok=21MHZPpp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is now due in spring 2026.</figcaption></figure><p>To tide you over until spring, Zhdanovich reveals that Sad Cat has "improved every aspect of the game" since it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-xbox-bethesda-e3-2021" rel="nofollow">initially revealed back in 2021</a>. He says the team's goal was to make the game with "no shortcuts", and so everything has been made "in a classic way", with "handcrafted pixel art".</p>

<p>The rest of the trailer delves into&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>'s animation and development processes. It's worth a look if you're interested in the story behind the game, and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPoyEkQePA4&amp;ab_channel=IGN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> courtesy of IGN.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Replaced</em>, it's an upcoming action platformer that blends chunky 2.5D-style pixel art with gameplay that "combines cinematic platforming...and free-flow action combat".</p>

<p>Set in an alternative 1980s,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>casts you as an artificial intelligence known as R.E.A.C.H., who's trapped inside a human body. You'll have to adjust to life as a human, all while discovering that "everything comes at a price", according to Sad Cat.</p>




<p>When it does finally arrive,&nbsp;<em>Replaced&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on Xbox Series X|S, and it'll be a day one Game Pass title as well. A specific release date will be announced later this year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toxic Commando HANDS-ON PREVIEW – The Co-Op Shooter That I Wanted]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/toxic-commando-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/toxic-commando-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-the-co-op-shooter-that-i-wanted.1279905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At Gamescom 2025, we were invited by Focus Entertainment to try out John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando, a cooperative shooter developed by Saber Interactive.</p>



<p>And if you’ve somehow never heard of John Carpenter—maybe you’ve been living under a rock—he’s one of the most legendary names in horror cinema, responsible for classics like Halloween, The Fog, and The Thing. His influence is all over Toxic Commando, especially in the group banter and cinematic cutscenes throughout the missions.</p>



<p>The story pays homage to 1980s horror films, which should resonate strongly with fans of titles like Left 4 Dead and Killing Floor. In the game, a scientific experiment goes horribly wrong, unleashing the Sludge God upon Earth. This monstrous entity begins a process of terraforming, threatening all life on the planet.</p>



<p>To clean up the mess, the scientist enlists the help of the Toxic Commandos—battle-hardened mercenaries tasked with stopping the apocalypse.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Official Gameplay Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eknbu0SKGzI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-toxic-commando-is-surprisingly-satisfying">Toxic Commando Is Surprisingly Satisfying</h2>



<p>During my play session, I teamed up with three other members of the press, and we communicated entirely through the in-game voice chat. To my surprise, the chat worked flawlessly—clear audio, no dropouts, and smooth coordination.</p>



<p>In games like this, communication is everything, and having a reliable voice system is a huge win. Our mission dropped us into an open map with the objective of clearing out specific zones. Each Commando has a unique class, and while we couldn’t choose our roles during the demo, one teammate deployed a protective dome, while my character generated a healing aura—each ability felt distinct and useful.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s experience with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is immediately noticeable. At several points, we were swarmed by massive waves of zombies, all powered by Saber’s impressive Swarm Engine. In Toxic Commando, you’ll even be able to use vehicles for traversal and crowd control, adding a layer of mobility and chaos to the action.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gunplay is another highlight. Weapons feel punchy and responsive, and enemies aren’t bullet sponges—a common pitfall in co-op shooters. The open map design also encourages optional exploration, which becomes essential for survival. With ammo running low and hordes closing in, scavenging becomes a strategic necessity.</p>



<p>Speaking of hordes, enemy variety is solid, mixing standard grunts with elite threats that require more coordination to take down.</p>



<p>The climax of our mission involved defending a structure from three massive waves of zombies. With over 200 enemies on screen and multiple points under attack, tension ran high. Thankfully, we managed to coordinate our class abilities and pull through.</p>



<h2 id="h-progression-amp-monetization">Progression &amp; Monetization</h2>



<p>Since the demo focused solely on gameplay, I didn’t get to explore the progression systems. However, a Focus Entertainment representative told me that players will be able to upgrade both their classes and weapons. More details on that will be revealed later.</p>



<p>As for monetization, information was limited. The current plan isn’t to push players into spending real money on cosmetics or similar items. It’s likely Saber Interactive will follow a model similar to Space Marine 2, with a battle pass offering cosmetic rewards.</p>



<p>John Carpenter’s Toxic Commando is set to launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series, with full crossplay support across all platforms. Based on my experience, it checks all the boxes I look for in a co-op shooter—and I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it.</p>



<p>If you’ve been missing the chaotic fun of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> or <em>Killing Floor 2</em>, this one should be on your radar too.</p>

<p>Previously, fans would have had to visit the eShop in either Japan or Hong Kong, but with a dedicated Taiwanese storefront, they'll have a much easier option.</p>
<p>In the announcement (translated by Google), Nintendo stated that fans will be able to "enjoy a more convenient and enriched gaming experience" and that "specific service content will be announced separately in the near future".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xymqvn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's yet another step in Nintendo's expansion into the Taiwanese market. The Big N opened up a new subsidiary, Nintendo of Taiwan, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/nintendo-sets-up-new-subsidiary-in-taiwan">in February 2025</a>, and the company has been running operations since 1st April this year.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Nintendo even <a href="https://www.facebook.com/justdan.taiwan/posts/pfbid033YL9t1A1e6gsMwS6wRSDRVhH8MAtdUMhpTpe2HphWwsZhUN5p36jBgXVYhf7gam4l">opened a Flagship Store</a> in the Xinyi district in Taipei in April, too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What has Sony learned from its biggest gaming blunder one year later? Why is Ubisoft’s CEO headed to court five years after a sexual harassment scandal rocked the company? And how many more copies will <em>Hollow Knight</em> sell as everyone rushes to play it ahead of <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch next month? Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take cover. The end-of-year game release onslaught is about to begin.</p> <h2>Sony is taking steps to avoid another<em> Concord</em></h2> <p>How did Sony slow-walk its way into a live service debacle that <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290">cost it over $200 million</a>? A year after <em>Concord</em> launched, PlayStation Studios head Hermen Hulst explained what the company is doing to avoid releasing another expensive game that no one wants to play. &nbsp;“I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply,” he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299">told the <em>Financial Times</em></a>. He promised more info sharing between studios and executives and said, “We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways. The advantage of every failure is that people now understand how necessary that [testing] is.”</p> <p>What about Sony’s live-service plans moving forward? Hulst didn’t say the company is backing off its online multiplayer push, but he did hand-wave away prior commitments to launch nearly a dozen live-service projects by 2026. “The number is not so important,” he said. “What is important to me is having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities.”<em> FairGame$</em>, expected to be the next multiplayer game in Sony’s pipeline, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961">recently lost its studio head after a bad internal review</a>.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft’s CEO has been summoned to appear in court</h2> <p>The French publisher <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/affaire-de-harcelement-chez-ubisoft-le-pdg-yves-guillemot-convoque-devant-la-justice_AN-202508220570.html">faces a fresh lawsuit</a> from the same victims who recently testified against former senior members of the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-metoo-reckoning-two-months-later-1844717203">over sexual harassment allegations</a>, including ex-chief creative officer Serge Hascoët. “This new case is being brought by the same plaintiffs, a union and four people, and is based on the same facts at those for which three former employees were tried and convicted this past June, following an investigation by the public prosecutor’s office,” Ubisoft executive vice president Cécile Russeil wrote in an email to staff on August 22.</p> <p>CEO Yves Guillemot was subpoenaed to testify on October 1, though it’s unclear if the new litigation will be able to compel any new information to surface about the company’s workplace culture reckoning five years ago. “Ubisoft will continue to cooperate with the justice system in this matter, as it has done over the past five years in the review of the facts related to this case,” Russeil <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-ceo-yves-guillemot-summoned-to-appear-before-french-court-in-relation-to-harassment-trial/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a statement.

While all first-party Nintendo games are contained on the physical Switch 2 carts, most third-party releases have opted for the game key card solution, meaning most will no longer be accessible if and when the servers eventually shut down sometime in the future.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima wrote a concept for <em>Death Stranding 3</em> but doesn’t want to make it</h2> <p>The longtime director told <a href="https://t.co/69Pwg1OTCO">PlayStation Arabia</a> that<em> Death Stranding 2</em> was his finale for the series, but that he has already scripted what a sequel might be about. “So I have that in data,” he said, according to a translation <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1959427581536842060">by Genki</a>. “I hope that someone will create it for me.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 is one of the biggest launches taking place before the end of 2025, and part of modern gaming means some players are probably wondering whether it will be included on Xbox Game Pass. We have the details.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 12</a>, Borderlands 4 will have more than enough to whet the appetite with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-will-feature-30-billion-guns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 30 billion guns</a>, and we were impressed with the title after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re yet to secure a copy of Borderlands 4 and are wondering if you can avoid splashing out due to a Game Pass subscription, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Borderlands 4 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not yet. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Borderlands 4 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when it launches on September 12th</strong>.</p>



<p>Borderlands 4 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would result in automatic inclusion in the service, and there has not been any announcement of it joining the catalog.</p>



<p>Though Microsoft has not announced the first wave of titles coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Pass</a> in September, any announcement for Borderlands 4’s inclusion would have likely been made well in advance, as it would have been a huge coup.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-borderlands-4-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Borderlands 4 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>Borderlands 4 is likely to come to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although any inclusion is likely to be a long way away.</strong></p>



<p>Gearbox has a history of releasing titles on Game Pass, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-more-games-leaving-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 3 leaving the service</a> on August 31 ahead of the launch of the new title. Borderlands 3, including all of the DLC for the title, joined the Game Pass catalog in April, resulting in a four-month stint on the service.</p>



<p>That shows that Gearbox is more than happy to embrace the platform, though it’s likely the inclusion period was decided upon to raise interest in Borderlands 4. Therefore, it would be surprising if the new title were to join the service anytime soon.</p>



<p>Given Borderlands 3 was first released in 2019, it took six years for the title to join Game Pass earlier this year. As such, don’t expect Borderlands 4 to feature for a long time, potentially not until post-2030, especially with plenty of DLC planned for the future.</p>

<p>For more Borderlands 4, take a look at our exclusive chat with Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> why he’s “a little nervous” about some parts of the game</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicting the title will break the 100 million sales mark</a>.</p>
