                <p>In 2025, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to gaming, as more and more top quality titles are being released one after the other. Developer Sandfall Interactive faced an unusual and unexpected challenge, as Bethesda announced and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">Oblivion Remastered </a>just days before the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot ahead of the release, Ben Starr, who voices the mysterious character of Verso in the game, said this isn't actually a bad thing at all, despite challenges that the small studio of just 30 developers may face. "I think when it comes to that, one thing that we can absolutely speak to is how exciting it is that we're in 2025--a year that, whatever your gaming tastes, whether you're obsessed with Blue Prince, whether you're obsessed with Oblivion, whether you're excited for Doom: The Dark Ages, whether you're excited for Clair Obscur, you have so much diversity to explore. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297"></a><figcaption>Starr voices the mysterious Verso in Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg"></figure><p><span>"I think Expedition 33 is this amazing new IP that doesn't come along very often. You've got two ends of the spectrum. You've got the remake of the masterpiece that is Oblivion, the juggernaut that is Oblivion, and you've got this new IP that is Expedition 33, and hopefully they can exist alongside each other," he explains.</span></p><p>"I know that they can, because there is so much space in the industry to enjoy it. This game isn't going anywhere. This game is on Game Pass. Download it, put it on your console, and experience it when you get there. Genuinely, what a great year for videogames." </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur's story is warm and endearing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png"></figure><p><span>When we asked Starr whether he'd be diving into Oblivion any time soon, he confirmed that it's certainly on his to-do list. "We're so lucky because we have a world where we are reinventing, not reimagining, and bringing old games to the fore. It's amazing for those who didn't get to play Oblivion. I look forward to playing it, I have it downloaded. At the same time, I'm deep in Clair Obscur. I'm a huge, huge fan of both."</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's release will certainly be bolstered by the reviews it received a day before launching. With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rpg-is-a-contender-for-2025s-best-game-and-its-not-the-one-you-think/1100-6531061/" data-ref-id="1100-6531061">Metacritic score </a>of 92, it's tied with Blue Prince for the best-reviewed game of 2025 so far. Our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur review </a>calls it "a phenomenal RPG" that "that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye." </p>

		<p>The development team of Tenderfoot Tactics has announced it has removed the game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, a Palestinian led campaign to highlight companies that are see to support the Israeli government’s actions again the Palestinian people.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tenderfoot Tactics Release Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBOl6AxRsUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the development team said, <em>“The Tenderfoot Tactics team has decided to remove our game from sale on Xbox in solidarity with the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign, which added Xbox to their priority boycott list earlier this month. We hope that Microsoft will listen to the voices of their workers and customers and stop all business with the criminal Israeli military, which we have watched conduct an open genocide in Gaza over the last 18 months. We hope that the broader community will join in the pressure campaign and fight for an end to occupation and apartheid in Palestine and across the world.”</em></p>
<p>The BDS Movement has claimed, <em>“Microsoft partners with the apartheid regime of Israel and its prison system. It provides the Israeli military with Azure cloud and AI services that are central to accelerating Israel’s genocide of 2.3 million Palestinians in the illegally occupied Gaza Strip. After 34 years of deep complicity with Israel’s military, the Israeli army relies heavily on Microsoft to meet technological requirements of its genocide and apartheid regime.”</em></p>

<p>Tenderfoot Tactics is still available for sale on PC and Switch. Microsoft has not yet released a statement on the removal of Tenderfoot Tactics, or addressed the reasons as to why the development team took the action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstations-classic-console-themes-from-30th-anniversary-celebrations-are-back-in-new-ps5-system-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of PlayStation's celebration of the platform's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> last year, PS5 owners enjoyed console themes based on each PlayStation console generation. These themes were only available for a limited time until today, when Sony announced that they are making a return in a system update that will be rolling out across the globe tomorrow, April 24, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">PlayStation Blog</a> post about tomorrow's update, Sony Interactive Entertainment's vice president of product management, Shuzo Kikuchi, announced a new feature coming to the system called Audio Focus. This new audio setting is designed to make the softer sounds in games louder for players using headphones, with the provided example being to make things like footsteps come through more audibly in your headphones.</p>
<p>Regarding the return of the classic console themes, Kikuchi admitted that their return was solely due to fans asking for them to return.</p>
<p>"<em>During our 30th anniversary celebrations, we surprised our fans with a limited time selection of nostalgic customization features for the PS5 System UI to honor the four PlayStation consoles that paved the way for PS5: PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4,</em>" Kikuchi wrote.</p>
<p>"<em>Due to the overwhelmingly positive response from our community, we're happy to bring back the look and feel of the four console designs for players to customize the home screen on PS5!</em>"</p>
<p>When you update your PS5 console, you'll be able to find these returning themes under a new menu in the system's settings called 'Appearance.' Having different themes for your Home screen has been a key customization feature PlayStation players have enjoyed since the dawn of the PS3.</p>
<p>Hopefully, bringing these themes back is just the first step towards more, like the many game-specific themes that used to be available. A few first-party and second-party titles already have themes set for the Welcome menu, but nothing like the themes from the 30th anniversary, which changed the console's entire UI. Players would surely love to see more of the latter down the line.</p>

Here’s the the teaser: </p><p>And here is the official synopsis from 20th Century Studios and Disney: </p><p>“<em>Predator: Badlands</em> is set in the future on a remote planet, where a young Predator  outcast from his clan, finds an unlikely ally in Thia and embarks on a treacherous journey in search of the ultimate adversary.”</p><p>In case you can’t tell from the trailer, <em>Badlands </em>will make one of the franchise’s deadly alien hunters the protagonist. As seen in the teaser, we are going to be spending a lot of time with this outcast Predator who seems to not wear a mask for large sections of the movie. That lets us get a good look at his alien face and mandibles and it reveals that one of the only flaws of <em>Prey</em>—the goofy maskless Predator design—has been fixed here. No more giant forehead! </p><p>If, after watching that teaser, you’re thinking, “Wait, didn’t we already see a trailer for a new Dan Trachtenberg-directed <em>Predator </em>movie earlier this month?” don’t be alarmed. You aren’t losing your mind. We did get a trailer for a <em>different Predator </em>movie<em>—</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-killer-of-killers-cartoon-animated-disney-hulu-1851775292"><em>Killer of Killers—</em>about two weeks ago</a></span>. That one is an animated movie featuring different Predators in different time periods and is also from Trachtenberg. That movie is set to launch on Hulu on June 6. Will it have any ties or connections to <em>Badlands</em>? Maybe!</p><p>Anyway, <em>Predator: Badlands</em> (the live-action movie) is set to land in theaters on November 7. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*1to08ik*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTQyNjc4NC4zMjUuMS4xNzQ1NDMyOTYwLjYwLjAuMA..">Two <em>Predator </em>movies in one year?

I have to admit, as a die-hard RPG fan: Microsoft, you finally got me. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Both Hit Game Pass This Week </strong></h2><div catalogid="40fca49d-caba-44af-a409-39bfc91958ad" id="218136"><div id="218136" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate – 1 Month Membership – Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows, Cloud Gaming Devices [Digital Code]</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was revealed and released on PC, consoles, and Game Pass on April 22. Like most people, I spent most of the day downloading the game and most of the night basking in the music. Highlights from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it">borderline-remake</a> include new character models, combat interactions, and remastered VFX. And while they did enlist more than five new voice actors, it seems Virtuos kept the best of the original's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago">janky dialogue</a>. The base edition of the remaster launched at a price of $49.99, which includes both the original DLCs, with a deluxe edition available for $10 more. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the long-awaited debut game from French studio Sandfall Interactive. Ahead of the game’s launch (12am PST tonight in the U.S.), it holds a 92 rating on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">IGN’s 9/10 review</a> praising the story design and describing it "as a true modern throwback.” The game’s stylish UI reminds me of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona series</a>, and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/clair-obscur-expedition-33-40-minutes-of-gameplay-4k-60fps-ultra-settings">gameplay footage</a> shows off one of the coolest turn-based combat systems I’ve ever seen. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-where-to-buy">base edition</a> is launching at the same price as the Bethesda remaster: $49.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Expedition 33 was marketed as the headline of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-spotlights-its-game-pass-april-2025-wave-2-rollout-including-clair-obscur-and-gta-5">April’s Game Pass lineup</a>, the surprise release of Oblivion Remastered has led to some concern of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-acknowledges-the-barbenheimer-energy-of-releasing-the-same-week-as-oblivion-remastered">"shadow"</a> over the indie game's release. That said, my perspective is that we're getting two incredible cakes, and Game Pass makes enjoying both a little easier on the wallet. Instead of spending $100 on two new games, I spent $20 on a Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Now the only question is when I'll touch grass again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plenty more of 2025's biggest games have recently made it onto the service, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-review">South of Midnight</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-review">Avowed</a>, which join mainstay classics like GTA V and, of course, the full spread of Call of Duty. It really does seem like there's something for everyone. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Game Pass Is a Ridiculously Good Deal Right Now </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game Pass Ultimate starts at $19.99/month and gives you access to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full Game Pass library</a> across console and PC as well as cloud gaming. The exclusive-to-PC Game Pass lowers that cost to $9.99/month. The Standard and Core subscription tiers are $14.99/month and $9.99/month, respectively, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">don't include day one releases</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">last Game Pass price hike</a> was in July 2024, and with these types of game launches, I wouldn’t be surprised if those prices go up again some time this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there aren’t any live <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-game-pass-deals">Game Pass deals</a> right now, you can pick up <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5Y2L8?object_uuid=856f6e02-2560-4c5e-8b74-7c80a1807a86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">three-month subscription</a> that might save you from any future price hikes.

It was also the best-selling game on Xbox in March, and second best-selling game on PlayStation and Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We reached out to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella for a bit more context on Assassin's Creed: Shadows' success. He told us that Shadows' launch was the third-biggest in franchise history in the U.S., following Assassin's Creed 3 and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla. "It's a great start, so now we'll have to see where it goes from here."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Ubisoft created a subsidiary company based on its Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six brands, with a €1.16 billion (approx. $1.25 billion) investment from Chinese megacorp Tencent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came after Ubisoft announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-now-up-to-3-million-players-but-still-no-sales-figure-from-ubisoft">Assassin's Creed Shadows had passed the 3 million player mark</a>. Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Shadows' release, and there is enormous pressure on it to succeed after the company's share price hit an historic low.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other stats reported by Ubisoft were already revealed by IGN’s coverage of an internal email in which the company contextualized Shadows’ opening weekend performance, saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage">it was better compared to Origins and Odyssey rather than the “perfect storm” 2020’s Valhalla launched into</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows saw the second highest day-one sales revenue in Assassin's Creed franchise history, behind only Valhalla, the biggest Ubisoft day-one ever on the PlayStation Store, and has seen over 40 million hours played so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">March was a big month for new releases, with seven of the top 20 games entering the charts for the first time, including WWE 2K24 (No.4), Split Fiction (No.5), Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (No.9), Xenoblade Chronicles X (No.17), and Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unification Wars (No.18). Hello Kitty Island Adventure also ranked No. 4 on Nintendo Switch specifically in its console debut, and free-to-play game FragPunk debuted at No.8 in the Top 10 Steam charts ranked by Monthly Active Users (MAUs).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In second place this month, just behind Assassin's Creed, was another debut title: MLB: The Show 25, which was also the best-selling game for the month on PlayStation. Its sales were 23% higher than its predecessor, MLB The Show 24, during the same debut month last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other games doing well in March included Fortnite, which led all games in MAUs on both Xbox and PlayStation, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which leapt from No.103 in February to No.10 in March on PlayStation specifically thanks to being added to PS+. Co-op horror game R.E.P.O. made a similar leap from No.93 in its debut month of February to No.1 in March on the Steam MAU charts, likely due to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/554398/repo-streamer-social-media-clips-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">growing social media virality over time</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all these exciting new releases doing pretty well for themselves, March was actually a bit of a low month for games as a whole. Overall games spending dropped 6% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, and content spending dropped 4% year-over-year to $4.2 billion, Circana reports. Non-mobile subscriptions and digital premium downloads on console were the only content areas showing growth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Piscatella for context as to why content spend was down, and he pointed to mobile as the primary perpetrator. Mobile spending, per SensorTower's report, was down 6% year-over-year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Mobile being such a big component of content means that a dip there usually means the market dips. Console full game download spending was up this March. But declines in mobile and drops in PC full game spend and a drop in digital add on content spending meant overall content fell."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for hardware, spending was down 25% year-over-year to $286 million, the lowest March spending total since 2019 ($279 million). PlayStation 5 was the best-selling console of the month, but its sales were still down 26% year-over-year. Xbox took second place, down 9% year-over-year, and Switch sales were down 37% from last year, likely in anticipation of the impending successor, the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows (NEW)</li><li>MLB: The Show 25* (NEW)</li><li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li><li>WWE 2K25 (NEW)</li><li>Split Ficton (NEW)</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>PGA Tour 2K25</li><li>NBA 2K25</li><li>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls (NEW)</li><li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>EA Sports FC 25</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li><li>Madden NFL 25</li><li>Elden Ring</li><li>Xenoblade Chronicles X* (NEW)</li><li>Suikoden I &amp; II Remaster: Gate Rune &amp; Dunan Unificaiton Wars (NEW)</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li><li>EA Sports College Football 25</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.

                <p>Console commands are a part of the very fabric that makes up Bethesda RPGs. While they're exclusive to the PC versions of games, console commands offer players a way to gain a small, or large, edge during their playthrough. The original Oblivion featured a laundry list of console commands, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> has brought all of them back.</p><p>Some console commands are fairly harmless in Cyrodiil, while others can completely alter your playthrough. You can activate god mode to rain down hellfire on the citizens of the country, or simply add some items to your inventory that you need for a quest.

                <p>The NBA is collaborating with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765" data-mce-href="/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> once again, this year dropping a pair of new NBA-themed skins based on Axo and Fishstick. In this drop, the fan-favorite Fortnite characters are sporting jackets that feature the team logos from either the Eastern or Western Conferences as style options, and their heads have been redesigned slightly to make them look like basketballs. This new set will hit the item shop on Thursday.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266" data-ratio="0.5624607658506" data-width="1593" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266"></a><figcaption>What the new NBA cosmetics look like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to the skins themselves, the new set of cosmetics includes two back blings, two pickaxes, and two emotes--and it'll reportedly be available all in one bundle. The highlight here may well be one of the back blings, actually. There's a mini jumbotron back bling in the set that counts your kills during a round, and lights up and plays arena organ music every time you defeat an enemy player. That back bling will be available to buy on its own for 400 V-Bucks.</p><p>The bundle that includes everything will <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost 2200 V-Bucks</a>, with each of the skins costing 1200 separately.

But those skins haven't been sold in the item shop since 2022--since a number of those uniforms are now outdated, those probably will not be coming back. Instead, Fortnite has dropped three waves of other NBA-themed skins, including the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75th anniversary defaults</a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cel-shaded skins</a> that use fake team logos, and now these basketball re-dos of Axo and Fishstick.</p><p>It's been a busy month for Fortnite collaborations, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417" data-mce-href="/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/" data-ref-id="1100-6530777" data-mce-href="/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/">Adventure Time</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/" data-ref-id="1100-6530911" data-mce-href="/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/">two new WWE wrestlers</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/" data-ref-id="1100-6531017" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/">four new TMNT characters</a>, these NBA skins, and, next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/" data-ref-id="1100-6530990" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/">Marvel's Winter Soldier and White Widow</a>.

Upon further investigation the individual pages for each game, though, you'll see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a Metascore of 95 on Xbox Series X|S, 91 on PC, and 92 on PS5, while Blue Prince has a 92 on PC, 84 on PS5, and 89 on Xbox. That gives Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a slight edge, even though it's technically <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-highest-rated-game-of-2025-is-one-you-might-not-know/1100-6530673/" data-ref-id="1100-6530673">tied with Blue Prince</a> on Metacritic's best-reviewed games list.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWZ-xf1dslw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RWZ-xf1dslw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's an impressive feat for the first game from the new studio Sandfall Interactive. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG inspired by classics in the genre. It's set in a world where everyone above a certain age dies when a number is painted in the sky, and players set off as part of the titular expedition in hopes of defeating the Paintress behind this. Its provocative story and intense RPG gameplay really resonated with critics, including GameSpot's own.</p><p>"This is a supremely confident game that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye, Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">GameSpot's very positive review</a>. "Its combat is a consistent delight, delivering thrills with thoughtful strategy and reactive action in equal measure, complementing a heartfelt story of shared grief and camaraderie."</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> also dropped this week and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">threatened to overshadow</a> Sandfall's debut, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is proving to be the can't-miss RPG of this month. It launches tomorrow, April 24, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog from day one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AI Has Come For The Horse In The Hospital]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ai-has-come-for-the-horse-in-the-hospital.1171704/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/google-ai-idioms<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This morning, my Bluesky feed was full of people who have discovered what seems to be a quirk in <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google’s AI search</a>. Apparently, if you ask it the meaning of an idiom you’ve made up, it will treat it like a real, well-known expression and, with the embarrassing confidence only AI can muster, tell you what it means.</p><p>In one apt <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/albertburneko.bsky.social/post/3lni7smjfps2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>, noted language genius and Defector writer Albert Burneko asked Google to define “ask a six-headed mouse, get a three-legged stool,” which Google says “suggests asking the wrong question or seeking the wrong advice from someone unqualified can lead to a nonsensical or unhelpful response.” Other examples have included “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t lick a badger twice</a>, “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/timmarchman.bsky.social/post/3lni72oq2t22m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t make love to a dead dog</a>,” and other <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gregjenner.bsky.social/post/3lnhxkdywzc2m/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fake phrases</a> like “two cars short of a Winnebago,” “don’t touch my mother’s goats,” and “one sandwich in the stomach is worth two in the toilet.” In every instance, Google inserted literal nonsense into the lexicon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is funny because it’s such a clear highlight of one of AI’s most dangerous flaws: the confidence with which it makes things up and then presents them to users as true. Like a man you wish you weren’t talking to in a bar, it (or, more correctly, the people behind it) is desperate to come off as knowledgeable and authoritative, even when it can’t possibly be. It takes obvious bullshit and spins it into truth, in the same way it tells you to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/pm/artificial-intelligence-tells-google-users-to-eat-rocks/103891826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat rocks</a> or recently gave me <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ll5kmvcqrk2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physically impossible chicken</a>.</p><p>But I think making up meanings for invented idioms is particularly telling of one of AI’s biggest flaws. It made me think of comedian John Mulaney’s famous “horse in a hospital” joke:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="There's a Horse In The Hospital | John Mulaney | Netflix Is A Joke" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhkZMxgPxXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>To ruin the joke for you with editor brain: The bit, a metaphor for the first Trump administration, is such a good use of language–besides the alliteration of “horse” and “hospital,” the phrase itself is evocatively weird. You assume it’s a people hospital (maybe because we usually say “vet” for animal hospitals), which raises all kinds of questions about how the horse got in there and what it would do in this situation, which provides the grounding for the rest of the joke. The two specific nouns paint a richer picture than, say, “there’s a bird in the bank;” they give high stakes, but it’s such a funny idea that it’s more intriguing than upsetting, providing just the right level of alarm to help you process your actual alarm about the real situation it calls back to.&nbsp;</p><p>If you hadn’t heard the joke and someone just said the phrase “there’s a horse in the hospital,” you’d have a sense of what it was getting at, but you couldn’t, or wouldn’t, define each word the way Google’s AI does. The joke and its reception are both so excellently human; the phrase has a meaning, but it isn’t a strict one-to-one. It highlights the fun of idioms and the things that only people can do with words. That’s given it some sticking power not just as a funny bit, but, to an extent, as part of our language.&nbsp;</p><p>So of course here’s AI to ruin that whole idea. AI can’t be clever or understand human cleverness; it can’t <em>play</em>; it can’t mess around with language, no matter what Sam Altman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/12/a-machine-shaped-hand-read-a-story-from-openais-new-creative-writing-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insists</a>. When you feed Google’s AI nonsense, it can’t screw around with that nonsense with you, it can’t go with the joke. Its answers aren’t funny because it’s creating and interpreting with you; they’re funny because of how energetically AI misses the point–not just of your question, but the whole idea of fun with language.</p><p>Beyond reminding us how easily AI spreads misinformation, this gives a glimpse of what everything we do could look like if the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2025/04/22/ai-schools-executive-order-trump-draft/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzQ1Mjk0NDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2Njc2Nzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NDUyOTQ0MDAsImp0aSI6ImMyMmFlNWY1LWZlZTUtNGFkNS04YzI5LTRkMGY2NGM2MDJkMyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyNS8wNC8yMi9haS1zY2hvb2xzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1vcmRlci10cnVtcC1kcmFmdC8ifQ.kZQoEmtK8YUZQVDTZidEQKeAAeZXTwtL7kFYsV8f0WA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losers</a> have their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/654223/cheat-on-everything-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way</a>. Mess and creativity are a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/654223/cheat-on-everything-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waste of time</a> to them; words and <a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drawings</a> are just containers for inputs and outputs, boxes with no room for anything that makes these things meaningful or fun. This is the embarrassing future the “AI in everything” crowd wants; this is the machine they want us to find essential when, even in a low-stakes situation, it can only demonstrate that it has no use. As a person who makes their living through words, I’m all in favor of you pushing your weird phrases into conversation with your friends; do cool new things with language, because AI certainly can’t.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending"><h3>Does Blue Prince Never End?</h3></a><p>After finding the 46th room, the journey in Blue Prince really begins.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xenomorph-a-spiritual-successor-to-alien-vs-predator-on-the-atari-jaguar-is-in-development-from-athena-worlds/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>UK-based studio Athena Worlds has announced that it is working on a new stealth survival game called Xenomorph, a spiritual successor to the beloved Alien vs. Predator game launched for the Atari Jaguar in 1994.</p>
<p>We know little about the game so far, except that it is happening after Jane Whittaker, the former co-programmer on the Atari AvP game in 1994, announced the project on <a href="https://x.com/WhittakerGames/status/1914981311263002968">his personal X account</a>.</p>
<p>"<em><span>You have been asking me for a personal sequel to our</span> Atari AvP for 30 years...</em>" Whittaker wrote. "<em>Funding, team in place. Production underway!</em>" Whittaker also included a key art image for the game, showcasing the classic shot of a Xenomorph with both its mouths wide open, ready to strike.</p>
<p>Whittaker is also the chief executive officer of Athena Worlds and commented on what this project means to him in a <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/335859/athena-worlds-announces-xenomorph-a-spiritual-sequel-to-alien-vs-predator">press release</a>, saying, "<em>It is a very personal journey for me</em><em>. So many people still talk about our work on AvP to this day, with a massive following. I have been asked for over 30 years to create my next survival and stealth strategy game. I am beyond thrilled to say that thanks to generous support, my day has come.</em>"</p>
<p>The game is in development for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S consoles, though this announcement just states that the project is in the works. There's no news about when we might see it come to light.</p>
<p>Whittaker also confirmed that <span>Mike Meaden</span> will be the project's creative lead, and Blaire Wathen will lead character design.</p>
<p>Regarding the game's setting, the press release includes a short snippet of the world players will be stepping into. It reads, "<em>After crash landing on planet XL-243, you quickly find you are not alone and the battle for survival begins</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The release also confirms that Xenomorph is "<em>aimed at being a landmark open world game of exploration, survival, high stakes tension and combat</em>."</p>

It may not sound like much, but that extra sustain can be extremely helpful against tough foes.</p><h2 id="h664444"><a id="wildfire"></a>Lune: Wildfire</h2><p>While “Immolation” will be Lune’s bread and butter for keeping Burn applied to single targets (especially if you’re using it with Gustave’s Marking Shot), Wildfire is the best early-game AOE (area of effect) option for her. This attack will deal solid damage and apply Burn to every enemy hit. And if you have two Ice stains built up for her, it’ll deal even more damage!</p><h2 id="h664445"><a id="healinglight"></a>Lune: Healing Light</h2><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> isn’t a particularly easy game on its standard difficulty, so unless you are perfect at dodging and parrying, you’ll need to have healing options. One of the best choices is Lune’s “Healing Light,” which can heal an ally while removing status effects. That’s a pretty sweet deal.</p><h2 id="h664446"><a id="guarddown"></a>Maelle: Guard Down</h2><p>While Maelle is a heavy hitter when you get her set up to go all out, she’s also great for applying buffs and debuffs. Grab “Guard Down” to apply the Defenseless status effect to all enemies so that your team can pummel them for even more damage than usual.</p><h2 id="h664447"><a id="guardup"></a>Maelle: Guard Up</h2><p>While “Guard Down” is excellent for helping you dish out more damage, Maelle’s “Guard Up” can provide Shell to your party, which reduces the overall damage they take. Taking less damage means less healing is required—and that means you can spend more time beating the hell out of baddies.</p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available on April 24, 2025 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
