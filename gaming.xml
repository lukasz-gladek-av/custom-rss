From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">128GB for $300</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">256GB for $400</a>. Preorders are live now at multiple major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1854689350764140880%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-batman-arkham-shadow-bundle-preorder-guide%2F1100-6526720%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>. </p><p>Announced during Meta Connect 2024, the Quest 3S has the same chipset as the standard Quest 3, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, and the same amount of RAM (8GB). Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3.</p><p>Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision.</p><p>You can check out the Meta Quest 3S bundle details as well as an upcoming Quest 3 bundle below.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2691" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Meta Quest 3S Preorder Guide" data-collection="" title="[Various] Meta Quest 3S Preorder Guide">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vega-1-Meta-Quest\/dp\/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vega-1-Meta-Quest\/dp\/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$300</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2. Not only are you getting a more advanced piece of tech for the same price, Meta is throwing in one of the most exciting upcoming Meta Quest 3 and 3S exclusives, Batman: Arkham Shadow. The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives.</p><p>The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year.</p><p>Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atlus-releases-prologue-demo-for-metaphor-refantazio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the latest game developed by ATLUS. At the Metaphor Launch Event in Tokyo, Studio Zero Game Director Katsura Hashino announced that the Prologue demo for the game is now available. At the time, it was only available on Xbox, but the demo is now available on PlayStation and PC.</p>
<p>By playing the Prologue demo, players will get a taste for some of the early-game narrative, as well as get to explore the city that players will eventually learn about in the full game. The demo also allows players to explore some of the social elements in the game and engage with some of the characters that will make appearances in the rest of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Demo Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zItvCKVaUrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Prologue demo, the journey begins, showing the player how to begin the journey of lifting the prince's curse. In addition, it gives players access to the first four dungeons and the ability to unlock seven of the 40+ classes that are known as Archetypes in the game.</p>
<p>In terms of social aspects, in the prologue, players will meet six followers, some of whom are party members who will support them on their journey in the game.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a new fantasy RPG in a new universe, created by the same iconic game developers who created Persona 3, 4, and 5. In this game, players are in charge of writing their destiny and have to work to rise above their fear to take the throne.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-gamescom-hands-on-a-jrpg-hit-in-the-making/">will launch on October 11, 2024</a>, on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Steam. Players can obtain multiple pre-order versions, including a Collector's Edition that features an artbook and plenty of BGM DLCs as they are released.</p>
<p>To celebrate the demo being released for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a Prologue demo trailer was released so players can see what they are getting into if they decide to jump into the demo. Additionally, all progress made in the demo will progress to the full game if <a href="https://metaphor.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you purchase</a> the game. This will allow you to get a head start in Metaphor: ReFantazio, and aid you on your journey through the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The demo is just under two minutes long and showcases some of the features players can explore in the game.</p>
<p>Although the demo is only the prologue, it's still a whopping 58 GB download, with the full game being roughly 93 GB to install.</p>

<p>It is a sad day when one of the best esports players to ever live retires from the competition. Topson, the popular Dota 2 competitor, is officially making his exit from the competitive Dota 2 scene. This comes just after he and his team got third place at The International 2024. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-topson-announces-retirement-from-dota-2-competitive-scene">Topson Announces Retirement from Dota 2 Competitive Scene</h2>



<p>The gaming legend announced his official retirement from the Dota 2 competitive scene recently via Twitter on the official Tundra Esports page. The competitor, who has been competing for Tundra Esports for quite some time now, gave some insights into why he will be leaving the Dota 2 competitive world.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>From standing in at TI12, to getting third place at TI13</p><p>Pogson, Godson, Dadson – Topson 🥹<br>After many patches, countless tournaments and some crazy picks we will have to say farewell to Topson as he retires from competitive Dota</p><p>Thank you for everything and all the best. 💙 <a href="https://t.co/dE6Va6zj5T">pic.twitter.com/dE6Va6zj5T</a></p></div>— TUNDRA (@TundraEsports) <a href="https://twitter.com/TundraEsports/status/1838609775266820446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>“I have always loved competition,” said Topson in the video posted on Twitter announcing his retirement. “All my life, though, has been about Dota. I think this year has given me a lot of clarity about my future.”</p>



<p>The rest of the video was filled with heartfelt moments, showcasing Topson’s victorious career. The competitor has seen his fair hair of Dota 2 action over the years, with various iconic moments competing in The International events and more.</p>

<h2 id="h-from-3rd-in-the-international-to-retirement-topson-makes-his-official-exit">From 3rd in The International to Retirement: Topson Makes His Official Exit</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Topson and his team, Tundra Esports, walked out of The International (TI) 2024 tournament with third place. While this may not seem as impressive as a feat compared to the teams that got first and second, the competitor has one of the most decorated careers within all of esports.</p>



<p>Not only has he competed in various TI events, but he also got first place back in The International 2019. </p>



<p>With millions in earnings under his name, Topson has built one of the greatest esports careers from the ground up, showing heavily what perseverance and hard work can do for a career. </p>



<p>Topson, you will be missed.</p>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:7886b1c7e92720ef3b1965682fd699d0 --><!-- empty -->
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the long-anticipated next major release in the popular historical, open-world game franchise, has been moved back from its previously announced November 15, 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The new date is February 14, 2025, according to an open letter <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906">posted to X</a> by franchise executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté. "We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features," Côté wrote. "As such, we've made the decision to postpone the release date."</p>
<p>He went on to promise a same-day launch on Steam as well as the console platforms for that date.
</p><p>Côté wrote the note to players, but a letter from publisher Ubisoft to investors <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf">went into more detail</a>. "While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," it says. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles." (It was previously announced that the game allows players to play as two characters: a samurai warrior and a stealthy assassin.)</p>
<p>The investor note also says that "the game will mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1," so that's a silver lining for PC players.</p>
<h2>A precarious position</h2>
<p>The massive-budget <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was positioned as an "Assassin's Creed, but in the Star Wars universe" game and was released on August 30. However, it was met with a mixed reception. Players, reviewers, and streamers praised its meticulous, high-fidelity presentation of Star Wars locales and characters, but they criticized its stealth gameplay as repetitive and frustrating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Among other things, the game involved lengthy stealth sequences that forced players to start over if they were discovered, but it didn't do a very good job of giving players the information and tools they needed to complete these sequences without resorting to trial and error. Shortly after the launch, one of the game's creative leads promised a patch (which arrived) that would fix one of the earlier missions, but his suggestion in an interview that the problem was simply with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-outlaws-patches-dlc-interview">a single mission early in the game</a> rather than something more fundamental rang hollow for many players.</p>
<p>Ubisoft acknowledged publicly that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> did not meet expectations in terms of either sales or critical reception.
</p><p>It's unclear exactly which lessons Ubisoft intends to take from the misfire of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. But Assassin's Creed is its most vital franchise, so after a setback like that, the company can't afford anything other than an enthusiastic reception for <em>Shadows</em> from players. It's the first tentpole release in the storied franchise in four years.</p>
<p>Of course, this delay now means that Ubisoft's open-world samurai game will launch in the same year as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-the-acclaimed-ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-a-sequel/"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a>, a sequel to the Sony exclusive big-budget open-world samurai game called <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> that many players felt did the Assassin's Creed formula more justice than most Ubisoft titles. <em>Shadows</em> will also launch just a few months before the planned release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which is likely to suck all the oxygen out of the room in gaming spaces for some time. There remains some possibility that<em> GTA6</em> will be delayed, though.</p>
<p>This is the first time an Assassin's Creed game from the main franchise has been delayed in a decade; the last delay was <em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em>, which saw its release date bump from October 28, 2014, to November 11. Despite the delay, that game launched with significant technical problems, which were mostly fixed in later updates.</p>

The place is filled with decades of Nintendo history, ranging from when the newly founded company made playing cards in the late 1800s all the way up to its current smash hit console, the Switch. But perhaps the best part of this museum is actually its gift shop, which is filled with some of the coolest Nintendo merch I’ve seen in a long time. </p><p>On October 2, after being announced in 2022, the official Nintendo Museum opens.

Well, you live an odd life, but lucky you, Nintendo can make your (oddly specific) dreams come true. There are also Wii U items, too. Perhaps the coolest things I spotted are giant pillows based on different Nintendo controllers. Finally, I can sleep on a massive and fluffy N64 gamepad.

Following new of "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws, Ubisoft has announced the open-world sci-fi adventure will get its first bit of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-reveals-lando-and-hondo-for-paid-season-pass">previously announced</a> post-launch story DLC - starring Lando Calrissian - on 21st November.
</p>
<p>
Titled Wild Card, it sees Star Wars Outlaws protagonist Kay Vess being hired to infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament. "But as she crosses paths with the notorious gambler Lando Calrissian," Ubisoft teases, "she soon learns that another game is being played."
</p>
<p>
Wild Card arrives alongside two more Star Wars Outlaws cosmetics bundles - Hunter's Legacy and Cartel Ronin - which will also be part of the Season Pass, and a free update introducing new Contracts for all players arrives on the same day.

<p>
Notably, 8th November is also the day Star Wars Outlaws will debut on Steam. News of its impending arrival on Valve's platform follows Ubisoft's announcement all its new releases will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">launch day one on Steam</a> (for the first time since 2019) starting with the delayed Assassins Creed Shadows on 14th February next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's announcement also follows Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">admission</a> Star Wars Outlaws saw "softer than expected" sales, leading to second quarter financial results that "fell short of [the company's] expectations". Despite Outlaws underperformance, Ubisoft told investors its development teams are currently "fully mobilised to swiftly implement a series of updates to polish and improve the player experience" in the hope it'll "engage a large audience during the holiday season".
</p>
<p>
The company expanded on those plans in a <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1838971704820801966">statement shared on social media</a>, promising fans it was "hard at work creating multiple titles updates which will bring optimisation, gameplay polishing, and tweaks, as well as quality of life changes includes adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay". That's on top of the previously announced Hondo Ohnaka Story Pack - titled A Pirate's Fortune - that's due to arrive in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
Whether all this will be enough to change Star Wars Outlaws' fortunes remains to be seen; Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt the game itself was fundamentally flawed when it launched back in August. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">wrote in his two star review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-keeps-crashing-xbox-series-xs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-to-do-if-starfield-keeps-crashing-on-xbox-series-x-s.992421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-keeps-crashing-xbox-series-xs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s apparently a widespread issue causing Starfield to keep Crashing on Xbox Series X|S. Bethesda is aware of the problem, though they don’t have any information on an upcoming hotfix to resolve the issue. For now, we have a few potential fixes that could help you resolve the problem and get back to exploring the Settled Systems!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-potentially-fix-starfield-crashing-on-xbox-series-x-s">How to (Potentially) Fix Starfield Crashing on Xbox Series X|S</h2>



<p>I know firsthand that dealing with crashes can ruin the experience, especially in a game like Starfield. You want to immerse yourself, losing yourself in its exploration and side quests, not constantly restarting your system or the game. Hopefully, the following fixes will help you enjoy the game on your Xbox Series X|S:</p>



<ul>
<li>Restart your game or console should the issue persist.</li>



<li>Remove any Creations, especially third-party Creations that do not fall under the Bethesda-featured sections of the mod menu.</li>



<li>Ensure your console has adequate airflow and, if necessary, move it to a different position to prevent overheating.</li>



<li>Uninstall and reinstall the game as a last resort.</li>
</ul>



<p>While it’s never fun to uninstall your mods, doing so could ease the problem and prevent you from reinstalling the entire game, which, depending on your internet, may take a long time.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-causes-starfield-crashes-on-xbox-consoles">What Causes Starfield Crashes on Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p>There are numerous reasons why Starfield may continuously crash on Xbox Series X|S, but the primary causes include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mod conflicts</li>



<li>Save file corruption</li>



<li>Overheating</li>



<li>Corrupted install/update files</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s unclear precisely which of these potential causes is the problem, and it could be all of them at one point or another, but hopefully, our above fixes helped you get back to your game without any further issues!</p>

Although the Silent Hill 2 reimagining is a project that fans have begged for years for, its release was nearly limited to only one platform. The only thing that saved it from sticking exclusively with PlayStation at launch was Bloober itself.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/silenthill2-1717063971235.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Bloober had to push Konami to release its Silent Hill 2 remake on PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Definitely Silent Hill 2 is a game that has been associated with the PlayStation brand from the very beginning,” the CEO said (as translated by DeepL). “At the very beginning, we had to push Konami very hard to lean on the PC topic. For them the main market is PlayStation, while looking at the interest on Steam, it seems that it should also be a successful launch.”</p><p>After much anticipation, Bloober’s Silent Hill 2 remake was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake"><u>announced in October 2022</u></a>. It’s a title fans have waited ages to see revealed, but the road to its launch hasn’t been without issues. When fans took issue with a combat trailer that arrived in January, Babieno quickly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-responds-to-controversial-combat-trailer-insists-it-was-handled-by-konami"><u>clarified that the footage was handled by Konami, not Bloober</u></a>. At the time, he went as far as to say that the trailer in question was “not the spirit of what used to be, or what we're creating now.” The CEO also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-producer-wants-fans-to-give-bloober-team-a-chance"><u>asked fans to give the team “a chance”</u></a> last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The October launch will be Bloober’s opportunity to prove itself. For now, it appears Bloober is confident that its push to release the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC via Steam will pay off.</p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake has a release date of October 8 for PC and PS5. It will be <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-biggest-game-releases-of-october-2024"><u>one of the biggest game releases of the fall season</u></a> when it arrives, but players on other console platforms won’t be able to enjoy it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>for at least one year due to an exclusivity deal with Sony</u></a>. We went hands-on with Bloober’s remake and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview"><u>shared our findings in August</u></a>. At the time, we said that the survival-horror remake is shaping up to be “an extremely faithful reimagining that mostly resists the urge to alter the successful formula of a stone-cold classic.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/love-letter-card-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>In Love Letter, two to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-6-player-board-games">six players</a> deduce, misdirect, and sabotage their way to winning the Princess’ favor. At the end of the game, those with enough favor tokens win, taking the Princess' hand to rule the kingdom together. Love Letter's gameplay is done through various cards, each with their own unique abilities and values that inform the way you play. As this is a deduction and reasoning game, it’s important to memorize where certain cards are at a given time, since you’ll often have the ability to look at your opponents’ hands throughout the numerous rounds played. </p><p>The original Love Letter game came to the States in 2012 and was distributed by AEG before being acquired by Asmodee in 2018. Numerous editions of the base game and themed expansions have been released in its decade-plus lifespan since. The Second Edition (which is now the definitive way to play) was released in 2019, and added five new cards to the mix, including the Spy and Chancellor, new artwork for every card, and the ability to play with up to six players. </p><p>Love Letter is good enough that it has landed on a number of our best board games lists, including our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pocket-sized-board-games">best pocket-sized board games</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">best quick-playing board games</a>. That's to say nothing of the spinoffs, which you can read about below.

Set up is a breeze, as you’ll deal one card to each player from the main deck before starting the rounds, which use a clockwise turn order. Your turns consist of playing cards from your hand that will both benefit you and hinder your opponents, so strategize accordingly. At the end of each round, favor tokens are awarded to players still in the round with the highest value card in play. Once the requisite number of favor tokens are held by one or more players, the game ends, and those players win! Games go quick, offering plenty of opportunity to replay, learn different cards, and find the best way to win.</p><h2>Different Themes</h2></div><p id="munchkin-loot-letter"><h3 data-toc-title="Munchkin Loot Letter">Munchkin Loot Letter</h3></p><div catalogid="ae79738d-5fc9-4733-9292-b53af810e6b5" id="207668"><div id="207668" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Munchkin Loot Letter</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $18.20</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-4 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20 minutes</li></ul><p>One of the products from the aforementioned AEG era, this Love Letter <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/munchkin-board-game-buying-guide">Munchkin</a> tie-in is seemingly one of the only themes from the publisher still widely available for purchase from retailers. AEG also produced a handful of other themed Love Letter tie-ins, like Legend of the Five Rings, Letters to Santa, and even FX’s Archer that are out of print. In this version, you play the same way as you would the base game, just with art and lingo from the Steve Jackson board game. It also comes with an exclusive card for use in Munchkin!</p></div><p id="love-letter-princess-princess-ever"><h3 data-toc-title="Love Letter: Princess Princess Ever ">Love Letter: Princess Princess Ever After</h3></p><div catalogid="ae79738d-5fc9-4733-9292-b53af810e6b5" id="207669"><div id="207669" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Love Letter: Princess Princess Ever After</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $18.91</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20 minutes</li></ul><p>Based on Kay O’Neill’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEVXB2?object_uuid=52bc0bda-8064-4f6d-b695-f98c01374187&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Princess Princess Ever After</a> series of graphic novels, this iteration is the only one to be published by Renegade Game Studios and does not change the gameplay mechanics of the original.

If the Thanos player gathers all six Stones, or if the heroes lose all their life, the game ends.

The diamond favor tokens and drawstring bag are also quite regal, making this a great gift for any Bridgerton fan.</p></div><p id="love-letter-sender"><h3 data-toc-title="Love Letter: Sender">Love Letter: Sender</h3></p><div catalogid="ae79738d-5fc9-4733-9292-b53af810e6b5" id="207673"><div id="207673" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Love Letter: Sender</h3></p></div><p>Released as a special promotion for April Fool’s Day 2020 (and great timing for those stuck at home at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), Sender is a free print-and-play version of the Second Edition! The only catch is you have to be creative with your own favor tokens. M&amp;M’s, anybody?</p><h2><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>If you research Love Letter online, you’ll surely come across a much wider variety of themes than what’s listed here. I don’t have the out-of-print games on the list, as I only wanted to focus on games more readily available for purchase, however a lot of them are available on the secondary market. For newer gamers and those looking to buy themed gifts for your geeky friends and family, Love Letter is the perfect pick-up-and-play card game, offering a handful of different popular IP reskins and replay value. </p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

            <p>Resident Evil's awkward middle child, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-3-nemesis">Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</a>, is now available via GOG. It follows in the leaking, shambling footsteps of Residents Evil 1 and 2, which likewise oozed onto the platform <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">in June</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc">in August</a> respectively.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The release of Resi 3 has the same treatment as the previous two games: full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, new graphics controls, a slightly better UI, and support for modern controllers.
</p>
<p>Resident Evil 3 was famously conceived as a spin-off from the main series, with a different protagonist, and was developed concurrently with Resident Evil - Code: Veronica. Capcom changed their minds during development and jammed existing resident Jill Valentine into the game and released it as the third mainline entry in the series. For those reasons, it's shorter than its seriesmates and a little less loved than Resis 1 and 2 or Mikami's glorious return as lead designer on Resident Evil 4.
</p>
<p>However! However: it's got a good scary tall lad in Nemesis, who hunts the player through segments of the game; it's got much the same appeal as Resi 2 (city, pre-rendered backdrops, good shotgun); and, I can never find it in myself to think "short" is a bad thing. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-3-review">strong 2020 remake</a> did a good job of bolstering its reputation, too, so here's a chance to play the original a little over 24 years after it was first released on Windows.
</p>
<p>Also there are so many Residents Evil now that arguably Resident Evil 5 is its awkard middle child, but let's not split hairs. A family can have more than one troublemaker round the dining table and you can <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3">buy this one for £9 over on GOG now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:0f9924db959da96dd03f53d1109ce2e8 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Thus far, Meta's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-continues-to-shovel-money-into-the-growing-vr-gaming-segment/">heavily money-losing Reality Labs division</a> has been primarily focused on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/">bulky virtual reality headsets</a> (and some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/even-people-who-bought-metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-dont-want-to-use-them/">odd, display-free Ray-Ban branded sunglasses</a>). So when Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pulled out a 100 g pair of see-through, augmented-reality glasses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetaforDevelopers/videos/449444780818091">at this year's Meta Connect keynote</a>, it represented a bit of a new direction for the company.
</p><p>The prototype Orion AR glasses Zuckerberg showed off today don't mean Meta will be ready to release a pair of consumer AR glasses anytime soon. But the demo represents a new vision for lightweight, wide-ranging, see-through smartglasses that Zuckerberg calls "a glimpse of the future" and "the dream of Reality Labs."</p>
<h2>Not your average screen</h2>
<p>The core challenge of building a pair of comfortable augmented-reality glasses, Zuckerberg said, is that "they have to be glasses." That means no bulky headset (a la Quest), no wires (a la Apple Vision Pro), and a weight of less than 100 grams (compared to a full 515 g for the Meta Quest 3). While there's a tiny battery and "custom silicon" in those lightweight glasses, Zuckerberg admitted that some processing is done in a "small puck" that connects wirelessly to the glasses themselves.</p>

<p>To achieve true augmented reality, Zuckerberg said Orion uses a screen that "is not actually a screen." Instead, the glasses use tiny projectors embedded in the arms, which shoot light into specially designed waveguides. From there, the light hits "nanoscale 3D structures etched into the lenses" to show holographic images that can be layered at various depths and sizes on top of a natural view of the real world as seen through transparent lenses.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Zuckerberg said it has been a challenge making sure those images are sharp enough to capture fine details and bright enough to be seen in all sorts of lighting conditions. "This isn't passthrough," Zuckerberg stressed during the keynote. "This is the physical world with holograms displayed on it."</p>
<p>Orion's microprojection technology allows for a field of view that Meta says is "the largest... in the smallest AR glasses form to date." <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/i-wore-metas-orion-ar-glasses-a-wireless-taste-of-a-neural-future/">In live demos</a> to press, Meta said that the field of view reaches 70 degrees, compared to just <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/">52 degrees for Microsoft's older Hololens 2</a> or <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/report-magic-leap-ones-field-view-detailed-developer-documentation/">50 degrees for the Magic Leap One</a>, to cite some more limited examples of consumer AR.</p>
<p>To control these holograms, Orion users can use voice commands or hand- and eye-tracking like that already seen on Quest VR headsets. But Zuckerberg also talked up a "neural interface" wristband—which the company has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/metas-hardware-plans-include-thinner-quest-this-year-ad-supported-ar-in-2027/">teased previously</a>—that can read tiny wrist and finger movements even without line of sight to the glasses themselves. That will let you interact with what's on your glasses without having to awkwardly speak out loud or hold your hands in front of you like a zombie, Zuckerberg said.</p>

With just a day to go until the launch of Atari 50's paid The Wider World of Atari DLC, developer Digital Eclipse has revealed all 19 titles it'll be adding to its acclaimed interactive museum.
</p>
<p>
Digital Eclipse announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-50-getting-39-new-games-in-dlc-detailing-intellivision-console-war">more Atari 50 was coming</a> back in June, explaining an additional 39 games would be joining the original selection as part of a new Expanded Edition before 2024 was through. More specifically, the Expanded Edition includes two new timelines exploring different facets of Atari's history - The Wider World of Atari and The First Console War - and both are being released as separate bits of DLC for existing Atari 50 owners.
</p>
<p>
The Wider World of Atari is the first of Atari's two DLC releases and launches for all platforms tomorrow, 26th September. Topics covered include a "deep dive into Stern Electronics' robot-blasting Berzerk; unusual and underappreciated innovations and hidden gems from the late 1980s; a spotlight on the artist Evelyn Seto, who helped create the iconic 'Fuji' Atari logo; Pong creator Al Alcorn explaining the birth of Breakout", and more.

</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24254312/space-invaders-my-play-watch-taito-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Taito Corporation, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/20/4856148/space-invaders-creator-says-hes-terrible-at-the-game">gave the world <em>Space Invaders</em></a> over 45 years ago, has collaborated with the designers of Floor 84 Studio to create a watch that pairs retro gaming with basic health tracking capabilities. The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240924896062/en/Blasting-Through-Time-SPACE-INVADERS%E2%84%A2-Joins-Forces-with-My-Play-Watch-and-Floor-84-Studio">Space Invaders: My Play Watch</a> is now available for $60 for the earliest backers of a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/f84/space-invaderstm-my-play-watch?ref=hodqsx">Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a>.</p></div><p>The My Play Watch was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240947/this-apple-watch-clones-best-feature-is-a-playable-version-of-space-invaders">teased earlier this month</a>, but we now know more about what its creators say it can do. Its design looks inspired by, or directly lifted from, the Apple Watch, but with a 1.86-inch touchscreen display and a body that’s not as thin as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24236801/apple-watch-series-10-price-specs-features-release-date">Series 10</a> or as thick as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables">Ultra 2</a>. It comes with two watch straps that match its retro gaming aesthetic, and it’s compatible with standard 22mm straps.</p><p>The watch has different faces with pixelated fonts and graphics all themed around <em>Space Invaders</em>, authentic sounds sourced from the original arcade machine, and even health tracking features like a heart rate monitor, a step counter, and an estimation of calories burned throughout the day. The real reason to strap the My Play Watch to your wrist is a custom version of <em>Space Invaders</em> that can be played using the watch’s touchscreen or its crown dial.</p><p>But the My Play Watch is unlikely to give the Apple Watch or Pixel Watch much competition. Its creators boast that it doesn’t connect to a smartphone at all. It won’t notify you of messages, emails, or phone calls, you can’t use it to ping a misplaced smartphone, and all of the health data it collects is only available on the wearable.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Space Invaders: My Play Watch includes several smartwatch features but no smartphone pairing.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Kickstarter</cite></p></div><p>There’s no shortage of <em>Space Invaders</em> games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/17/23798016/google-taito-space-invaders-world-defense-ios-android">available for various mobile devices</a>, including <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Finvaders-mini-watch-game%2Fid986212363">watchOS</a>. The My Play Watch is leaning hard on nostalgia as its main selling point as a way to convince retro gaming fans to take a risk on its Kickstarter, as the watch is still in the development phase and hasn’t yet moved to production.</p><div><p><strong>A note on crowdfunding:</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature. Companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember, you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div><p>For the first 48 hours of the crowdfunding campaign, a yellow or red version of the Space Invaders: My Play Watch is available for preorder with a $60 contribution. After that, they’ll jump to the same price as the blue version at $75. The creators say that they expect to ship it as early as December, but that feels optimistic since they admit that development of the watch’s custom OS is still underway.</p><p>Many Kickstarters have been plagued by unexpected delays as products move from the development phase to production, particularly those involving electronics. Some have been delayed for months, while others fail to materialize at all, leaving backers without anything to show for their pledges. This might be one to keep an eye on until it actually ships.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
