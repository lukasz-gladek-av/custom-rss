<figure><a title="Nintendo Gamescom 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb741be92b82d/nintendo-gamescom-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ant Dickens / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new report states that Nintendo of America is cutting loose around 200 long-time contractor jobs as it has decided to outsource its customer support services ahead of the Switch 2's first holiday season.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season">IGN's Rebekah Valentine</a>, who spoke to numerous customer support staff and sources under anonymity. Many confirmed to the outlet that they were told back in March 2025 that their contracts were being cut and gradually being phased out. None of the contractors have received direct communication from Nintendo itself, hearing instead through their agencies about the news.</p>
<p>Now these contractors are expected to train their replacements, many of whom are based in South American countries, primarily in Brazil, Argentina, and Nicaragua. These have previously been limited to first-line contacts who act as representatives to send the information and problem on to the main team in the US.</p>
<p>There are concerns from the sources that there will, "in the immediate term" be a drop in quality of support, particularly once the fully-trained agents leave, with the Big N seeming to prioritise saving.</p>
<p>While the new contractors all speak English, some IGN spoke to said there were "a number of communication issues internally" with an "increase in customers becoming irate, belligerent, and even racially abusive".</p>
<p>Nintendo of America, in a response to IGN, has stated that "the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information" and that "our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive." The company did not respond to requests on which claims were inaccurate.</p>
<p>Here is NoA's full response:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>One source told IGN that Nintendo of America normally works with two US-based agencies to fill customer support roles, including fraud, chargebacks, chatlogs, phone and email support, refunds, repair support and more. "There are a few people remaining on-site overseeing it, but essentially it’s all going away.”</p>
<p>A former employee acknowledges the nature of being a contractor and that "there was no guarantee to return after contract breaks", but feels that Nintendo could have approached things differently. "I personally feel as though Nintendo could have easily hired on a bunch of the contractors as FTE and had better results while still saving money from having to use the agencies."</p>
<p>"It's also such a volatile economy to be dumping all of us out into", with others echoing similar concerns, especially with the rise of generative AI in the customer support field: "“A lot of us are feeling betrayed, empty, like almost led-on in a way."</p>
<p>This is sadly not the first time Nintendo has cut contractor jobs suddenly. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/nintendo-of-america-restructuring-testing-department-over-100-contractor-jobs-reportedly-eliminated">NoA downsized and restructured its testing department</a>, with a reported 100+ contractors losing their jobs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Sync Presentation, Shanghai-based VR manufacturer <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/pimax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimax</a> has unveiled three new Virtual Reality headsets based on its new Micro-OLED product line.</p>



<p>Micro-OLED technology is considered by some to be the future of virtual reality thanks to its ultra-high pixel density, near-infinite contrast, and deep blacks. However, it has so far presented significant challenges, including heat management, optical compatibility, and scaling to high resolutions. Pimax claims to have overcome these challenges with its proprietary three-element ConcaveView pancake optics, which enable Micro-OLED to deliver clarity and immersion without compromise.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The widest FOV in micro-OLED VR Headsets | Pimax Sync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpSIZy_VZrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The most accessible headset of this trio is the Pimax Dream Air SE, which offers premium clarity with its 2560 x 2560 resolution per eye and ultra-sharp Micro-OLED panels. It is also extremely light at 140 grams, making it one of the lightest VR headsets ever manufactured. Its full-featured package includes built-in 6DOF SLAM tracking, Tobii eye-tracking, dynamic foveated rendering, and integrated spatial audio, making it ideal for everyday VR. The Dream Air SE is priced at $899 and can be pre-ordered <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on this page</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Its larger sibling, the Pimax Dream Air, was presented by the manufacturer as their compact flagship featuring 3,840 x 3,552 resolution per eye — over 27 million pixels combined — with Sony Micro-OLED panels for unrivaled sharpness. Thanks to Pimax's ConcaveView pancake optics, the Dream Air achieves an unprecedented 110° horizontal and 120°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) for such a portable form factor. Weighing under 170 g, it is optimized for both gaming and professional applications with stereo overlap that enhances depth perception. It is far more expensive, though, at $1999. Pre-orders can be submitted <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Finally, the Pimax Crystal Super goes even further with its 116° horizontal and 128°+ diagonal field of view (FOV) with Sony Micro-OLED panels and ConcaveView optics—the widest FOV ever achieved with Micro-OLED VR technology. As part of the modular Crystal ecosystem, it supports interchangeable optical engines, including Ultrawide, 57 PPD clarity-focused, and Micro-OLED. This gives users the flexibility to switch between maximum immersion and maximum sharpness. The price is $2199 and the VR headset can be purchased <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-crystal-super-sony-8k-micro-oled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Early adopters will receive exclusive bonus accessories from Pimax, including prescription lens frames and a free copy of Le Mans Ultimate. The products are scheduled to be released later in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-underground-excess</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-underground-excess.1302876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is less sequel, more spinoff to the original 2018 FPS, and it boldly bursts into a new genre: the "bullet heaven," also known as "walk around while your guy automatically attacks." In a gameplay style that seems be getting increasingly saturated day-by-day, does <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s foray do enough to separate itself from the pack?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Survivors Classic...</h2>



<p>As you might expect,&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>plays much like the 2022 smash hit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-survivors-castlevania-crossover-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. You walk around, gain experience, level up, and use those levels to upgrade and acquire new weapons. Enemies swarm around you and with some exceptions for projectile-spitting foes, about the only way to take damage from them is to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers.</p>

<p>The sheer numbers show in the scale of content, too. 300 achievements, for one, as well as a bevy a missions with different mutators and twists to take on. It's a completionist's dream, or nightmare, depending on how you look at it.</p>

<p>You start with one weapon and gain your next three at set levels. This means that you're definitely going to want to be comfortable with your starting weapon, as it and one other random draw may be all you have for a while.</p>

<p>The formula of combat is pretty familiar for this, with weapons offering various upgrades as you level up. The weapon upgrades differ a little bit, thanks to the addition of milestones called "overclocks" at certain levels.</p>

<p>Overclocks give significant boosts to power in many different ways, from something as simple as a damage boost, to an overclock for a grenade that splits into three weaker versions of the same grenade. These upgrades change the already interesting weapons variety, giving even runs with similar weapons the possibility to feel different.</p>

<p>As for traversal, each stage consists of 5 sort of mini-stages, each culminating in a boss fight. After the boss fight, you'll have 30 seconds to get to a drop pod and escape to the next layer, or risk being abandoned.</p>

<p>This mechanic in particular gives a lot of fun risk-reward management, as you debate if it's worth going back for that sweet XP pile before getting to the drop pod. It also contributes to the general fast pace of the game, leading half-hour runs to feel like they're done in the blink of an eye. "One more run" was rarely just one.</p>

<h2>...With Some Miner Changes</h2>



<p>Speaking of risk-reward, the biggest innovation that <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>'s survivor spin brings is the addition of, of course, mining. In addition to using your weapons to fight off enemies to gain experience points and level up, you can dig for materials, in particular Gold and Nitra, that help you buy upgrades between stages.</p>

<p>The addition of mining is a very welcome one, and gives a lot of incentive to thoroughly explore each layer as you visit it. With how brisk the game moves you along, it's rare that you'll get to see everything in a stage, so it's up to you to decide what's worth mining for, and what's better off ignored.</p>

<p>I found this to be a great addition to the known formula. It's a good compromise, giving me more to do, while also keeping attacks automatic like the titans of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>In addition to mining for Gold and Nitra, you'll be tasked with secondary objectives, tasking you with finding anything from flowers to mushrooms. Collecting your quota of these will reward you with a healthy chunk of Gold and XP, adding a scavenger hunt element to your runs.</p>

<p>I enjoyed hunting for these materials, but wish they also served more of a purpose. Unlike Gold and Nitra, which help purchase upgrades for your run, and other minerals, which unlock permanent upgrades from the main menu, materials like Morokite that secondary objectives request seemingly disappear into the ether after you leave the layer.</p>

<p>These secondary objectives seem like they could have been even better if they helped steer me towards materials that also worked towards permanent unlocks, but as it stands, are just fun temporary distractions for each stage.</p>

<h2>Grinding My Gears</h2>



<p>The headline addition that arrived in the 1.0 version of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is the gear system. Gear is equipment that enemies have a chance to drop throughout your run, which you can then equip to your characters before a run, offering stat buffs in a variety of areas.</p>

<p>Despite its headline billing, the gear was one of the more disappointing aspects. The random enemy drops combined with the miniscule benefits led me to mostly just use the handy automatic "smart equip" feature and just go back into another run instead.</p>

<p>This meta progression was the overall weakest part of my time with <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em>. Unlocks felt like they came at a slow pace, and first runs with each class especially felt almost scripted with how few options you were able to choose from for your arsenal.</p>

<p>And as for those aforementioned minerals, they serve mostly to gate off certain upgrades. For instance, you'll need pearls to increase your XP gain, but a different kind of gem to increase your critical hit rate.</p>

<p>While I understand the whole system is built to encourage mining, it feels like the whole thing would've been a lot more streamlined if I could've sold the treasure and bought any upgrade with the primary currency, instead of sorting through 7 currencies to see what upgrades I can maybe afford.</p>

<p>Despite my minor meta progression and unlock complaints, it's undeniable that the moment-to-moment gameplay of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor&nbsp;</em>is an excellent distillation of the bullet heaven genre.</p>

<p>It's come a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-preview" rel="nofollow">long way since early access</a>, and the mining and small-stage format gives it a breakneck pace that makes that intoxicating "one more run" promise that the best of this genre should tempt you with.</p>

<p><em><strong>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</strong> was reviewed on PC and Steam Deck using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 10 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

It’s a lengthy look that comes from user @BobNetworkUK, who reports that they have <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969053836011618398" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already managed to secure a new Labs account</u></a> after <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1969044830182383929" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>their previous account was disabled by EA</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/lrWKhc8NS0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lrWKhc8NS0</a></p>— bob.

The player can be seen running around a warehouse, dodging bullets from enemy players as they collect weapons, armor plates, and other tools from nearby loot chests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other clips have also spilled onto platforms like X, including footage of how things like <a href="https://x.com/BattlPULSE/status/1969074216872890471" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>upgrade kits</u></a> and <a href="https://x.com/BF6Meta/status/1969034590879695149" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>custom weapon drops work</u></a>. It’s important to note that none of what we’ve seen so far is final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 itself still has a few weeks to go before its October 10 release date for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S arrives. BF Studios hasn’t officially announced when exactly the Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will launch, though <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ModernWarzone</u></a> reported earlier this week that its sources expect its release date to be October 28, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and BF Studios are no strangers to leaks, especially when it comes to Battlefield 6.

<p>Not quite an own goal, at least</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>With the Switch 2 getting many <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/fc-26-on-switch-2-on-parity-basically-with-ps5-according-to-ea-sports-dev">more feature-parity</a> sports games, and looking visually <em>much</em> improved over their Switch 2 predecessors, we've been more excited than usual to take to the field and go for a good ol' kickabout.</p>
<p>And, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> out in early access (ahead of its full release next week, on 26th September), we've put the kit on once again to see just how this latest iteration of EA's football (or, yes, <em>soccer</em>) series fares.</p>
<p>The results are... <em>mixed</em> to say the least. The lovely Felix has played a few games already and, as you can probably tell from the gameplay video up top, EA Sports FC 26 is locked at 30fps on Switch 2. That isn't ideal, especially when the game runs at 60fps on other consoles, including the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Another issue that Felix has spotted is after the second half kicks-off, some NPCs just remain on the pitch, unmoving, standing in the path of the goal. It happens a few times — watch the screen on the right at around <a href="https://youtu.be/zEeK-8I84eI?si=f--HcIXF9zWxroql&amp;t=392">6:32</a> minutes in and you'll see what we mean.</p>

<p>Well, it's still early days, and the full release isn't due out for another week, so maybe EA will iron some of those issues out. But the 30fps is probably here to stay, which is a shame given the Switch 2 version has some nice visual upgrades.</p>

              <p>The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator <em>Ready Or Not </em>was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>On or around September 17, <em>Ready Or Not’s</em> community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.”</p></blockquote> <p>Screenshots and posts of this comment <a href="https://x.com/KayfabeMediaYT/status/1968548146398609603/photo/1">were quickly shared online</a> by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what Void did.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz7e5vzadc2w">On Friday</a>, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in<em> Ready Or Not</em>‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.&nbsp; Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz5esqafws2e">was no longer listed</a> as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server <a href="https://discord.com/channels/310075021882294272/452425840274309120/1418631175823687750">claimed</a> that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted.</p>

 <p>“To Our <em>Ready or Not</em> Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.&nbsp; “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around <em>Ready or Not.</em>”</p> <p>This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">a developer working on<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was fired by Sony</a> after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">The alleged killer’s connection to video games</a> has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">referencing <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html">ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure</a> to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/steam-will-drop-support-for-the-last-32-bit-windows-systems-in-january-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Though the 32-bit versions of Windows were widely used from the mid-90s all the way through to the early 2010s, this change is coming so late that it should only actually affect a statistically insignificant number of Steam users. Valve already pulled Steam support for all versions of Windows 7 and Windows 8 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/steam-will-end-support-for-windows-7-and-8-in-january-of-2024/">in January 2024</a>, and 2021's Windows 11 was the first in decades not to ship a 32-bit version. That leaves only the 32-bit version of Windows 10, which is old enough that it will stop getting security updates in either October 2025 or October 2026, depending on how you count it.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">According to Steam Hardware Survey data</a> from August, usage of the 32-bit version of Windows 10 (and any other 32-bit version of Windows) is so small that it's lumped in with "other" on the page that tracks Windows version usage. All "other" versions of Windows combined represent roughly 0.05 percent of all Steam users. The 64-bit version of Windows 10 still runs on just over a third of all Steam-using Windows PCs, while the 64-bit version of Windows 11 accounts for just under two-thirds.</p>
<p>The change to the Steam client shouldn't have any effects on game availability or compatibility. Any older 32-bit games that you can currently run in 64-bit versions of Windows will continue to work fine because, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/steam-drops-macos-mojave-support-effectively-ending-life-for-many-32-bit-games/">unlike modern macOS versions</a>, new 64-bit versions of Windows still maintain compatibility with most 32-bit apps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo is well known for the litigious lengths it will go to, and its legal battle against Palworld developer PocketPair is just the latest major example of the company's legal team pushing things as far as they can. </p>



<p>It <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/">launched its suit almost exactly a year ago</a> at the time of this writing, and as the battle has ensued, Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">changed the patents</a> it claims PocketPair is infringing to try to better align them with its arguments, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">successfully acquired new patents</a> to better stack its claims, and now, the latest argument being made to answer PocketPair's attempt to use game mods as part of their defense, is that game mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>This report comes from <a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">Gamesfray</a>, which has followed the suit closely for months now. Essentially, PocketPair pointed to game mods as a way of trying to cut the legs off of Nintendo's claims. Nintendo responded by arguing that game mods are not prior art, because a mod for a game only works with that game, and doesn't run independently from it.</p>



<p>Nintendo would have the judge see mods as patentable by other parties, making Nintendo vulnerable to others taking ideas from Nintendo titles, patenting them, and using them in other games. That's why Nintendo wants the judge to believe mods don't count as "<em>prior art</em>."</p>



<p>The potential ramifications of Nintendo securing a win with these arguments are pretty scary when you consider how far it could take such a precedent. We'd likely see even more legal action from Nintendo going after people who just wanted to make a cool mod, who put hours of their time and effort into creating an original mod for others to enjoy. And that's just on a smaller, individual scale. </p>



<p>Of course, that's if Nintendo is successful with these arguments. We've yet to hear what the judge presiding over the case has to say about what has been presented so far, and Gamesfray predicts that we won't hear any major updates for the remainder of the year.</p>



<p>Still, what's certain is that the outcome of this suit will have a major impact on the videogame industry, whichever way it goes.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-patch-notes-depth-derank-2000627170</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode-is-kicking-players-asses-so-much-they-can-now-demote-themselves-to-a-lower-difficulty.1302813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s only been a week since <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">new hard mode was added</a> to the multiplayer roguelike, and FromSoftware is already patching in some relief after even the most stalwart fans found themselves brutally beaten down. The mode has five depths, with the goal being to eventually complete enough successful runs to reach the deepest and most difficult one. Now, however, players will have the option to arbitrarily boot themselves back up to upper levels so they can stop dying and actually have fun again.</p> <p>Depth 1 is straightforward enough. While some <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624">harder enemies and new item debuffs</a> force players to adapt to the game in new ways, most were able to make short work of it. Then came Depth 2. For my team it was like hitting a brick wall, but others successfully made it to Depth 3. Past that, the game basically becomes a no-hit run mode in disguise. Within a few days some fans were already begging for an option to play on the lower difficulties again just for fun. With a shockingly quick turnaround, FromSoftware has now obliged.</p> <p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments">An update that went live today adds</a> “a new feature to voluntarily decrease your Depth ranking by one level.” It also gives loss protection to players at lower Depths, so that your first loss on Depth 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately lose you points and kick you back to the previous one. This protection even applies if you’re returning to Depth 3 or 4 for the dozenth time. This is mostly for players at the final Depths who lose more points from a loss than they earn for each win.</p>

   <p>“Lets go voluntary derank,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1nl4hun/elden_ring_nightreign_upcoming_deep_of_night/">wrote</a> on the subreddit. “This is based,” wrote another. “But we really just need more bosses.”</p> <p>The new system allows more casual players the option to enjoy the mechanics in the new mode without having to run something they just keep dying in. At the same time, some players are wondering why FromSoftware doesn’t just nuke the whole ranking up system altogether and just let players choose which Depth they want to play on from the jump. Some fans were also hoping for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">a true “endless” mode,</a> which was rumored based on original datamines for the Deep of Night update but which appear to have been based on a mistranslation.</p> <p>Deep of Night is cool overall, but the progression system has been a bit of a bust. It’s also not a replacement for new bosses, maps, or random events during runs. The new difficulty mode will need more tweaks if it’s going to keep<em> Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> in the multiplayer rotation for a lot of current players, especially with so many other big games coming out this fall. But in the meantime, at least everyone can go back and farm the broken Deep Relics they need from easier Depths.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review.1302810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been six years since the last mainline </span><i><span>Borderlands </span></i><span>game. (No, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496"><i><span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</span></i></a> <span>doesn’t count.) A lot has changed in the last six years, both in the land of video games and in the real world. Players expect a lot more from co-op shooters. And the people in charge are power-hungry losers. </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>tries to change with the times, with mixed results.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While it’s a damn fine shooter, the best Gearbox has made, and one which lets the franchise now stand comfortably next to genre titans like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, its attempts to address life living under a fascist regime don’t work out as well. But you’ll probably be too busy talking and joking with your friends to notice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span>, in a lot of ways, feels like a soft reboot of the series. The past games still happened and are referenced in big and small ways throughout the story, but the sequel is set on the new planet of Kairos and features new villains, allies, and things to kill. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">And unlike </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><i><span>Borderlands 3</span></i></a><span>’s story, which revolved around saving the universe and hopping across the galaxy, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is a smaller, more contained yarn mostly focused on what happens when powerful people take control and never let go.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A New World To Be Saved</b></h2> <p><span>While I won’t spoil any specific details in this review, I’ll let you know ahead of time that if you are coming to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>to enjoy a satisfying tale of people rising up under fascism to defeat evil, you’ll get that—right up until the end of the main campaign. Then it kind of falls apart.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A twist in the game’s finale turns its main villain, the Timekeeper, into a far less compelling character. But before that, I really enjoyed the amount of time Gearbox devoted to showing how evil the Timekeeper and his cronies are, and how characters deal with the question of how much they’re willing to sacrifice for freedom. And what happens when some go too far, or not far enough? Don’t expect </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>-like depth and writing about genocidal leaders here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how often I cared about what was happening to both new and returning characters alike. Gearbox’s writers do a fantastic job of really making you hate the Timekeeper and his various underlings. Don’t get </span><i><span>too </span></i><span>attached to anyone in this story. That’s all I’m saying…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Of course, if you play </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>with a group of your rowdy, silly friends, a lot of its writing will get buried under your pals screaming about loot drops or laughing about inside jokes. If you care at all about the tale Gearbox is telling here, do a run through the story by yourself and take your time to interact with characters and listen to audio logs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you play alone or with others, to defeat the Timekeeper and break his ironclad hold over Karios and its suffering populace, you’ll need to kill thousands of troopers, aliens, monsters, and robots using some of the billions of guns available to loot in</span><i><span> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <h2><b>Killin’ In The Name…Of Fun</b></h2> <p><span>What’s going to keep me coming back to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> for (likely) years is the gunplay and movement. I’ve never outright hated the combat in past </span><i><span>Borderlands</span></i><span> games, but this is the first one where I think Gearbox has truly nailed it. And not just because they tossed in more guns than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> lets players double jump, glide, grapple, and wall climb around the open world of Kairos. This, combined with guns that, overall, feel more distinct and punchier, really helps elevate </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>into the upper echelon of first-person shooters.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Further elevating combat in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>are the shooter’s four distinct and new playable Vault Hunters. Each one shakes up how combat encounters play out thanks to their different powers and abilities. Playing alongside a powerful Rafa, a cybersoldier, will lead to combat encounters that feel very different than when you play alone or next to other hunters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Really, you get like</span><i><span> 12 characters,</span></i><span> because each hunter has three skill trees that each feature mini-skill trees inside. Perhaps you and a pal both play Vex, the new Siren character. Well, you’ll likely be very different versions of Vex by the time you both reach level 50, thanks to all the different skill and ability options available to each of you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627162">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I leveled up, found great guns I liked, and got more comfortable with the new movement options, I would often get into flow states where I’d lost track of time. I’d end up losing 10 minutes to a random encounter on my way to a big quest simply because I just love shooting shit in this game so much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I did find, though, that </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>has a nasty habit of throwing a few too many waves of enemies at you during a lot of encounters. I’d wipe out the fourth or fifth wave of angry psychos or space buffalo, and then another wave would arrive. And then another. It often felt like too much, and made some missions and activities drag on. Still, I wasn’t too mad because once I’d wiped every enemy out, I was left with piles of loot.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Crappy Green Pistols For As Far As The Eye Can See</b></h2> <p><span>The loot in </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> like in past games, is the real secret sauce. It’s what keeps you going through a boring mission, or makes it hard to stop playing despite feeling tired and needing to go to bed. That promise that the next gun, shield, or grenade that drops will be better than anything you have.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, most of the time, what drops is garbage you won’t use, but thanks to</span><i><span> Bord</span></i><i><span>e</span></i><i><span>rlands 4</span></i><span>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">improved loot management options</a>, collecting and selling truckloads of terrible rifles and shotguns is easier than ever. And when that amazing piece of loot </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>pop out of a dead enemy or chest with a distinct ping noise, it’s one of the best feelings ever. If I could bottle it and sell it, I’d be a very rich man. It feels even better in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>because some of the best loot, Legendary guns, are much rarer than in the last game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And because nearly everything you do around the open world of Karios rewards you with loot, it can be hard not to just keep playing for hours and hours. Kairos is a big map, chockablock with small activities to complete–like activating a radio tower and defending it from baddies–as well as bigger or sillier side quests, world bosses, collectibles to hunt down, secrets to find, and random events to complete.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box-quote</p>                 <p>"Billions of guns, four friends, one meh ending."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Gearbox</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (Played on both PS5 and PC) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person co-op focused sci-fi looter shooter</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Combat better than ever, great traversal options, QoL changes, open world.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bugs and performance problems, less-than-satisfying ending, some fights feel too big.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 12, 2025 </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>As a result, the open world of </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is more active and alive than in any previous entry in the franchise, and all of this content rewards you with more loot. Thank god you can junk most of it in seconds. Otherwise, I’d have drowned in all the green pistols that the game dumped on me over my 60 or so hours with it across PS5 and PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Loot also becomes a currency among friends. Get a cool sniper, but you don’t snipe? Drop it for your friend. And then, if they find a badass shield that suits your character build better, they’ll share it with you, or you can at least guilt-trip them into giving it over. And because guns can spawn with all sorts of wild extra parts that turn SMGs into rocket snipers or whatever, hunting for loot and sharing it with pals is more exciting than ever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Well, assuming you can </span><i><span>see </span></i><span>the guns you have. A nasty bug affected one of my friends and made all his guns invisible. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment with</span><i><span> Borderlands 4: </span></i><span>the technical problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Excuse Me, There’s Some Bugs In My Looter Shooter</b></h2> <p><span>On PlayStation 5 Pro, I routinely had to restart the game due to the performance tanking <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">after a few hours of play</a>. I also encountered a few bugged quests that required restarts, too. Over on PC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">many players and I have experienced optimization and performance problems</a>. Even on my RTX 5080, which can run everything I throw at it, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>demands I turn on DLSS and frame gen while also turning down visual settings. And despite getting the game to run at a mostly stable 120FPS, I still encounter microstutters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>On both platforms, I’ve also found empty vending machines, seen characters hovering off the ground, had animations break, events not start, and encountered audio lines cutting out randomly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this has completely ruined my enjoyment of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">Borderlands</a> 4</span></i><span>, and I’ve had some sessions in which it all worked pretty flawlessly, minus some hitches or stutters. But it would be irresponsible not to mention these technical flaws and annoyances in a review o</span><i><span>f Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> as they are just as much a part of the game as the loot, combat, and story. Hopefully, Gearbox can patch the game over the next few weeks and months to create a better experience, and this part of my review will then become a weird artifact from the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627163">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Still, despite some annoying bugs and performance problems, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> in many ways, is the best game Gearbox has ever made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It takes what the studio has learned about creating looter shooters and builds upon that in a way that feels like a big moment for the franchise. A large leap forward in both gameplay and narrative. I joked with colleagues that critics and players would suggest this is where the series “finally grew up,” but really, that’s what it feels like.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The story isn’t as cringeworthy, with far fewer memes, more character-driven jokes, and a sense that you might not get out of this adventure with all your friends in one piece. The combat and movement are more refined and expanded, no longer feeling like an afterthought as was the case in past games. And the world of Kairos is visually varied and packed with good reasons to explore it alone or with friends.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Bugs, performance problems, a less-than-memorable villain, and a grindy endgame are disappointing for sure, but what Gearbox has put together is still a mostly fun, action-packed, and hand-crafted looter shooter that proves once again that this studio is still the best at making these kinds of over-the-top FPS RPGs. </span></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price.1302789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd8949de626ff/hautepad-x-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cosmox Gaming is best known for its Haute Pad range of arcade controllers, many of which can be considered budget options for fight fans, while pretty much all of them are immediately compatible with the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>The HautePad X wired controller is a slightly different proposition, and it’s a <em>wild</em> one. It’s comfortably the most premium of Cosmox Gaming’s controllers at a base price of <strong>$229.99</strong>, and there's a good reason for that. Unlike most arcade controllers which just have one main function, the X boasts several thanks to its modular design.</p>
<p>If you opt for every available module (which ramps up the price even more; the low-profile suite alone costs $69.99), you can completely customise the X to your liking, swapping out the full-profile ‘Ice Cream’ switches for low-profile ‘Wind Engine’ switches, inserting a pair of analogue sticks, or even completely ditching the leverless approach for a more traditional joystick. It’s a remarkable design, and I could definitely see other manufacturers attempt something similar in the future.</p>

<p>The X comes with its own carrying case, and it's worth highlighting this right off the bat. It looks like an average laptop bag from the outside, but opening it up reveals two main compartments. The top houses the controller itself, while the bottom contains compartments for any additional modules and tools you might want to keep handy. There’s no dedicated slot for the joystick module, which launched later, so you’ll need to figure out how best to transport this if you’re taking the controller out and about.</p>
<p>Closing the case also reveals an indentation around the edge that displays the Cosmox Gaming logo, and this is perfectly placed to act as a makeshift ‘cushion’ of sorts if you happen to play on your lap. This gives the controller more height and may prove more comfortable for some players, while the indentation prevents it from moving during more intense gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The controller itself is exceptionally well-made, with the majority of the body constructed from aluminium with RGB lighting around the entire edge. It weighs in at 1.32kg (or 2.92lbs) with an elegant, minimalist design with two subtle logos in each lower corner. Across the bottom, meanwhile, is a full non-slip cover to keep it nice and secure when playing on a desk. Even if you don't get any additional modules, this is a superb leverless arcade controller on its own.</p>

<p>Despite the brushed finish of the aluminium, I did notice that it still picks up the odd fingerprint here and there. They mostly fade away, but heavy usage over time may result in some unsightly marks. Keep it clean with a microfibre cloth, and you’ll be fine.</p>
<p>A function bar at the top contrasts the main body with a glossy finish, and contains the home button, +, –, back, and turbo (in Switch mode, '–' actually functions as the 'Capture' button). On the left, you’ll find a tournament lock toggle, while a small OLED screen is situated in the middle. This displays your button presses in real-time while also providing information on which profile you’re using along with any <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=SOCD">SOCD</a> cleaning modes.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, you’ll need to make sure to set the controller to the correct profile to use it with Switch or Switch 2. This is easy: looking at the module on the top right, these contain your action buttons, and all you need to do is hold in the bottom left button (labelled ‘A’) while plugging the device into the Switch. Done!</p>

<p>The controller will remember your profile, too, so you won’t need to faff about with this whenever you want to play; just plug it in and off you go. Those on PS5 and Xbox will need to purchase a separate authenticator to plug into the top right USB slot, but Switch owners needn't worry about this at all. Happy days.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the HautePad X comes with built-in LED lights to label the buttons; similar to those found on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">8BitDo Arcade Controller</a>. This isn't dynamic, though, so when you set the device to Switch mode, the button functions won’t match up with the labels. So ‘A’ becomes ‘B’, ‘X’ becomes ‘Y’, and so on. Once you’ve played a few games, you’ll soon become accustomed to the layout and you won’t even need to consult the labels, but it’s something to watch out for if you’re just getting started.</p>
<p>Now onto the modules. Starting with the left directional buttons, you can customise this with high-profile switches, low-profile switches, WASD keyboard switches, or a joystick. Excluding the joystick for a moment, the other three modules can also be angled up to 30° by loosening the two screws and turning the module while it’s in place. It’s worth just placing your fingers over the buttons and seeing what feels most comfortable, then simply angle the module accordingly.</p>

<p>The screws are crucial to swapping out the modules, and the HautePad X comes with the correct screwdriver to remove and install each piece. With the Switch 2 showing just how convenient magnets can be, there’s a small part of me that wishes the X utilised this technology for convenience. On the flip side, waggling the joystick module about would make me quite nervous about yanking it out entirely, so having the screws in place to keep everything secure feels like the right move.</p>
<p>With the bottom module, you can customise this with analogue sticks and an optional blank module if you happen to be using the joystick, plus the usual high/low profile switches. The analogue sticks are the one part of the entire controller that caused me quite a lot of hassle, and it’s because they’re simply not plug and play.</p>
<p>Using them correctly requires a fair bit of remapping via the configuration tool (which is accessed by plugging the device into a PC), merely thanks to the nature of using sticks vs. standard buttons. Even when you’ve got everything working, playing the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> isn’t ideal or comfortable. I suspect that something like JunkFood Arcade’s new <a href="https://junkfoodarcades.com/products/sworl-multiconsole">SWORL controller</a> might be better suited for these types of games, since it’s built with this configuration right out of the box.</p>

<p>The right module comes with just two options: high-profile and low-profile switches – easy, so let’s move on to the joystick module. This thing is awesome and, unlike the analogue sticks, works straight away. This is because there are four Ice Cream switches housed in the base, so the movement of the stick hits these switches accordingly, thus creating the correct input.</p>
<p>It also comes with three optional input gates, so if you’re not keen on the curved square gate, you can swap this out for circular or octagonal options. Similarly, the module even comes with two additional springs for the joystick, so you can customise the tension. I found the default was pretty much spot on. Finally, the joystick topper screws off, so if you want to purchase something a bit flashier than the basic black model, then that’s an option. All in all, as accurate as leverless controllers are, there’s just something inherently <em>fun</em> about a more traditional joystick, and it works wonderfully.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, you could get this controller as it is, no modules, and have a grand ol' time with it. The default high-profile switches are great and are perfect for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear -Strive-</a>, but I personally stick to the low-profile suite as my go-to. There's slightly less travel required for each button press, and I'd say they're slightly quieter too. Whichever option you go for, the spacing of the switches is slightly closer together compared to 8BitDo's offering, so this is especially beneficial for those with smaller hands; you're not going to be stretching all over the place to pull off those sick combos.</p>
<p>As for the WASD module, this is a particularly great option for 2D platformers. Things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/contra_anniversary_collection">Contra Anniversary Collection</a> or even the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Super Mario World</a> on NSO feel really satisfying, and unlike a lot of d-pads these days which can sometimes register incorrect inputs, having each direction on a separate key naturally renders this particular issue null and void.</p>
<figure><a title="HautePad X 19" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/266477684c981/hautepad-x-19.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The HautePad X is a marvel of modular design. The fact that most of the modules can simply be slotted into place without having to faff around with wires is mad, and whether you're into low-profile, high-profile, or WASD switches, or you prefer a more traditional joystick, most options here are simply excellent.</p>
<p>The downside is that the (optional) analogue stick module is a bit of a hassle to set up, and even when you're good to go, it can't replace the comfort of a standard controller. With this in mind, while the HautePad X is striving to be more than just a fight pad, its overall appeal may still be limited to the fighting game community. If you fit into that group, then what you've got here is one of the best options available for Switch and Switch 2 right now – just so long as you can stomach the premium price point.</p>

            <p>Whenever possible, I like to sucker-punch everybody's weekend plans by blogging the release of a huge 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game, factory sim or other managerial timesink last thing on Friday. In this case, I'm ambushing you with the avid rodent carpentry of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/whiskerwood">Whiskerwood</a>, the new city builder from Railgrade developers Minakata Dynamics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publishers Hooded Horse. It's got 40 different commodities, an elaborate weather simulation, and a demo out now on Steam. Haha, yes! You are welcome.
</p>
<p>In Whiskerwood, you are a mouse mayor setting up island colonies on behalf of some bastard fat cats. Yes, this one's a straight-shooting allegory, but going by the release date trailer, any transferable learnings about the plight of the mouse proletariat come a distinct second to the joy of plaiting conveyor belts.

<p>"Though your ship arrives with an initial supply of resources and a starting band of mice, you must quickly establish core structures, essential services, and production capabilities to ensure continued growth and prosperity," comments <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/">the Steam page</a>. "Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish. 
</p><p>"The cats will demand their due," it goes on, "and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis - you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat." Cue opening bars of the Circle of Life.
</p>
<p>Other bulletpoints stress the role of verticality. Given that you're building on fairly titchy islands, you'll soon need to layer them up by either plunging underground or stretching your production facilities up mountainsides. It doesn't seem quite as extreme as All Wall Fall, in which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-diseased-mind-makes-a-city-builder-with-actual-building-physics">your teetering metropoli are subject to actual real-time physics</a>, but those mice factories do look rather cramped and precarious.
</p>
<p>Your mice colonists have distinct attributes that fit certain tasks, together with preferences and weaknesses. Some are cool with labouring underground, others are all fine and dandy with air pollution. Up to a point, anyway. In good news for the bleeding hearts who feel bad about forcing virtual animals to breath smog for 100 hours, the Steam page suggests that you can one day overthrow the cats. 
</p>
<p>"Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties," it thunders. "Will you forever serve this oppressive paw? Or will you raise your whiskers in defiance?"
</p><p>The game simulates a whole kaboodle of things. Different growing conditions per crop, for instance: you'll want damp caves for mushrooms, good soil and sunlight for wheat, and high ground for potatoes. (I grow potatoes. I wasn't aware they were best planted on hilltops.) If starting terrain conditions are suboptimal, you can lay hot water pipes to create greenhouse environments. All this and: naval combat! You'll be able to send forth galleons of nautical nibblers to scout new islands and hopefully not get the shit kicked out of them by pirates.</p>
<p>One comparison is the beaver-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/timberborn">Timberborn</a>, one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">best building games</a>, but I'm also slightly reminded of fellow Hooded Horse production <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a>, sans roguelike elements. Whiskerwood launches into early access on 6th November, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126370/Whiskerwood_Demo/">find that demo on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years.

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sports FC 26 Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-fc-26-review-in-progress.1302774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the last few decades, soccer (or football, if you’re not from the US like me) hasn’t changed much. Sure, there are new rules, improved tactics, and so much more money involved in the modern game – but at its heart, it's still all about kicking a ball into a goal more than the other team. So how does a series like EA Sports FC improve each year when the sport it’s emulating isn’t introducing massive changes? For me, it’s about quality-of-life updates, and FC 26 has those in spades. You’ve heard the phrase “death by a thousand cuts,” but this is more like “fixed by a thousand pieces of tape.” It’s not that every problem has been solved, and many of the micro issues like confusing player-switching and weird tackle animations have returned from FC 25 – but at least in my early time with it, FC 26 is inching in the right direction in nearly every aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A phenomenal example of this is the new gameplay presets. In the past, everyone was using the same gameplay style, whether diving into competitive games in Ultimate Team or trying to win the league against CPU opponents in Manager Mode. This year, EA has split things between two different presets: Competitive and Authentic. With the Competitive preset, you can expect the fast-paced action and smarter AI teammates that you might be used to from previous FC/FIFA games. Meanwhile, Authentic will feel more realistic to what you see on the real-life pitch every weekend. Players are slower, and you need to use your tactical intelligence to get into scoring position. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important part of this change is that these two options do not impact each other. That means EA can tune Competitive mode however is needed without changing the balance of Authentic mode, something they couldn’t do in previous versions of FC. I’ve only played about a dozen games with each preset so far, but they already feel distinct in a way that is valuable. Players come to FC 26’s various modes for different reasons: Career Mode players want a game that plays as close to real-life a possible, while Ultimate Team and Clubs players want fair and balanced online competition. Those two ideals have sometimes worked against each other in the past, so giving us two totally separate gameplay styles lets EA serve both communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s strange about the implementation is that the Authentic preset is restricted to offline modes only. That means you can’t even use it in your Squad Battles matches despite them being the only single-player content in Ultimate Team. It’s something I hope is added in the future, as it feels strange not to include all of the single-player content by default, especially when it does exactly that with the new version of the Season Pass.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This might be the worst version of a Season Pass in a sports game yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before diving into some of the other positive changes, let's go over that Season Pass, as it’s one of the biggest points of contention for me. Last year, EA introduced a paid Season Pass into FC 25 toward the end of the cycle, so we knew this was coming, but seeing it drop on day one does sting. You can ignore it and stick with the free version of the pass, or even earn enough in-game currency to buy it without spending real-world money, but I would argue that this might be the worst version of a Season Pass we’ve seen in a sports game yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue with FC 26’s Season Pass is that you’re not just earning rewards for Ultimate Team, where people are already (unfortunately) conditioned to spend money. You’re also earning a ton of rewards for Clubs, Player Career, and Manager Career. The latter is where things really get icky, because one of the big draws for FC 26 is that Icons and Heroes are finally available in Manager Mode. For the first time ever, you can take classic players like Luis Figo, Toni Kroos, and Julie Foudy and put them into your Manager Mode saves. It should be a revelation, but instead, EA made the strange decision to lock many of these players behind the Season Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FC 26 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are several reasons this is frustrating. The first is that you probably won’t be able to acquire enough XP for them by playing Manager Mode alone. EA might implement more ways for non-Ultimate Team players to earn XP, but with how things are currently constructed, you’ll <em>need </em>to dive into that lootbox opening simulator if you want to finish enough of the pass to claim all of the Career Mode rewards. Even as someone who primarily plays Ultimate Team, this change sucks. I already know how bad FC’s monetization can get, and I hate seeing it expanded to more of the playerbase in a way that feels scummy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As if that weren’t frustrating enough, Career Mode players aren’t likely to earn enough Ultimate Team-specific currency to purchase the Season Pass in that mode alone. That means you’ll need to spend real money to unlock players like Gianfranco Zola, Miroslav Klose, and Park Ji-Sung. Keep in mind, this is only the first Season Pass. If FC 26 continues to lock Icons and Heroes behind future passes, we’ll likely see desirable players like Ronaldinho, Ruud Gullit, and Johan Cruyff tucked behind a paywall as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an unfortunate situation that reeks of EA trying to get even more money out of its playerbase than usual. It’s bad enough that Ultimate Team players are being milked dry, but now you can’t even enjoy your offline Career Mode without feeling the pull to spend money.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this even more painful is that most of the modes feature fun updates to their tried and true formulas this year. For example, the new Manager Live Hub lets you dive into specific challenges and earn new jerseys for your club. These feel like the next step toward a historical mode like the Negro Leagues option in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review"><u>MLB The Show</u></a>, as you’ll be challenged to recreate moments like Jamal Musiala’s double with Bayern Munich or take a mid-level club like SK Rapid or Strasbourg to European glory. The classic version of Career Mode is still there, but Manager Live gives you a rotating list of challenges that will test your skill on and off the pitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even Ultimate Team is home to several small yet meaningful changes. Everything from the return of tournaments to the ability to choose the cosmetics on your Evolutions feels carefully crafted to deliver the improvements fans have been asking after for years. We’ll have to wait a month or two to see the impact of the slower Ultimate Team power curve, and I’m hesitant to judge the stability of the servers until they are live for everyone, but my early experience is positive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While I’m not much of a Clubs player, the new Archetypes have certainly piqued my interest. Without a dedicated group, it’s unlikely I will spend too much time in Clubs, but the Archteype system seems like an improved way to handle progression to my untrained eye. While a meta will surely settle over the mode in the coming weeks, having this clear sense of forward momentum makes me wish I had a group of 10 friends to play with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have more to play this weekend, but so far FC 26 seems to provide enough quality-of-life changes that I feel more positive about the on-pitch product after a few years of stagnation. However, I can’t help but be annoyed by how heavily monetized every mode is becoming. I’ve always felt it was relatively easy to ignore the pull to spend extra money unless you wanted to compete at the very top of Ultimate Team, but that’s much less true this year. Now, not even the Career Mode players are safe. FC 26 is EA at its most money-hungry yet, and I can’t help but worry where we’re going next.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> has been upstaged this summer by a bitter fight between publisher Krafton and the former leadership team at the game's studio, Unknown Worlds. Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as CEO Ted Gill were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>, and they subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">filed a lawsuit against Krafton</a> that contends the latter is attempting to avoid paying them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Now, Krafton has changed its legal argument about why the leadership team was dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton asserted that the founders intended to release Subnautica 2 in early access this year before the game was ready in order to secure their performance bonus. The founders' lawyers at Fortis Advisors asked for proof of this assertion during the trial's discovery phase, and Krafton didn't provide any. Krafton subsequently withdrew that part of its legal filing and no longer claims it as a reason for their dismissal. Fortis said this marks a "seismic shift in the case" and characterized it as "a little bit bewildering."</p><p>Krafton still maintains that the founders shirked their responsibilities to oversee Subnautica 2 to completion and accuses them of downloading files and keeping devices that had confidential info on them. Although that detail only came to light after the leadership team was removed, Krafton argues that it retroactively justifies their termination.</p><p>Fortis contends that Krafton hasn't been properly cooperating during discovery and is ignoring requests to confer or share information pertinent to the case. The most recent update is that both sides agreed to confer.</p><p>This case may play out in court for years, but the battle in the court of public opinion has already begun. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a> over reports that the $250 million bonus was being withheld, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting its financial benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of that bonus would have gone to the former leadership team prior to their forced exits from the company.</p><p>Subnautica 2 is expected to hit early access in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>If you're like me, one of the first things you do when booting up a game is checking out the options in the Settings menu. From audio to subtitles, brightness to performance, you're fine-tuning the particulars to ensure the game is playing just right for you. Maybe during this, you're also changing your controller settings from "normal" to "inverted," and if you've ever wondered why you do that, well, science may have an answer for you.</p><p>In a new scientific paper reported on by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scientists-have-worked-out-why-some-people-invert-video-game-controls-and-its-not-just-because-they-are-correct" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Dr. Jennifer Corbett and Dr. Jaap Munneke at Brunel University London have sought to study the neuroscience behind a player's choice of "normal" or "inverted" controls. Titled "Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments," the duo discovered that there are a variety of factors that go into your decision of opting for a particular controller setting in games, and it seems to primarily revolve around how your brain perceives objects in 3D spaces.</p>

<p>Initiated during lockdown and published this month, Corbett and Munneke concluded in the study that "personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved" in why you choose to invert your controls in-game or not.</p><p>"Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not," Corbett said. "Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback."</p><p>To understand the phenomenon, Corbett and Munneke asked participants in the study to complete a questionnaire to understand their background and partake in an experiment around spatial awareness.</p><p>"They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical 'Simon effect' where it's harder to respond when a target is on the opposite vs. the same side of the screen as the response button," Corbett said. "Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted."</p><p>According to Corbett, the assumptions for why people prefer inverted controls were wrong. Instead, the biggest determining factor was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect.</p><p>"The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert," Corbett said. "People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks. Though [non-inverters] tended to be faster, they didn't get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate."</p><p>Essentially, just because a flight simulator may have been your first experience with a game doesn't mean you're inherently an inverter. Similarly, just because you've always played with normal controller settings doesn't mean you're a non-inverter either. In fact, according to the study and Corbett's musings, switching your preferences could make you a better gamer.</p><p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try--and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” Corbett said. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn't mean they won't learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don't realise they're naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p><p>Next time you're contemplating your controller settings, whether you should go with your preference (either inverting or not inverting), you may want to reconsider the other option. It could help you last longer in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

<p>God 'a do it</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>After a lengthy Early Access period, we now finally know that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> will be arriving as a Switch 1 &amp; 2 timed console exclusive on <strong>25th September</strong> — that's next week!</p>
<p>It's exciting times for those of us who have been waiting for the full launch all this time, and to make sure that nobody misses a beat, Supergiant Games has announced the exact times that the god-like roguelike sequel will arrive on the Switch eShop in each region.</p>
<p>The times were shared in a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supergiantgames.bsky.social/post/3lz54umuubc2e">BlueSky</a>, and we've assembled the following list so you know the appropriate time to hop onto the eShop wherever you are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 9am PDT / 10am MDT / 11am CDT / 12pm EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 5pm BST</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 6pm CEST / 7pm EEST</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 1am (Fri) JST / 12am (Fri) AWST / 2am (Fri) AEST</li></ul>


<p>As a reminder, Hades II will set you back <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> and there's even a free upgrade path to the 120fps Switch 2 edition if you opt for the S1 version at launch.</p>
<p>Those after the physical edition (which is complete-on-cart, we might add) will have to wait a little longer to get their hands on the game, with Supergiant announcing that boxes won't be hitting shelves until 20th November.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon-2000627131</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-50-000mah-fast-charger-hits-final-sale-now-down-83-on-amazon.1302735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all been there: that moment when your iPhone runs out of battery when you desperately need it to last. Even if you do have a power bank, more often than not, it’s the wrong cable, or worse, the standby battery isn’t even charged. That’s the frustration this 50,000mAh power bank seeks to eliminate entirely: It’s enormous in size, has all the cables you could possibly need integrated right in, and is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/">currently priced at an all-time low of $34 on Amazon, down dramatically from its usual $199</a>. That’s an <strong>83 percent off sale on a charger</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An Actual Power Bank That Fixes Everyday Charging</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the number that means the most: <strong>50,000mAh</strong>. That is just a phenomenal amount of mobile power. In all realism, you could <strong>charge your iPhone more than a dozen times before this battery depletes itself</strong>. That’s seven days of continuous use without having to use a wall charger, or more than enough power to charge your phone, your earbuds, your tablet, and even a friend’s phone when you and your group are all running low on power. The appeal is that you don’t need to bring a lot of extra accessories with you. Instead <strong>of working with adapters and wires, all you need is built-in</strong>. The unit contains four cables built in (USB-C, Lightning, Micro-USB, and USB-A) so you just grab one out and plug in straight into your device.</p>



<p>And on top of that, this charger isn’t just small, but fast: With <strong>22.5W fast charging backed by PD 3.0 and QC 3.0/4.0 technology,</strong> it recognizes your device instantly and adjusts for optimal charging. For example, an iPhone 17 can go from zero to about 60 percent in half an hour. That’s faster than the old wall chargers Apple used to pack, and it’s incredibly useful when you’ve only got a few minutes before heading out the door.</p>
<p>Safety has been integrated into the system as well: The company also had a monitoring chip that keeps an eye on<strong> charging by milliseconds to avoid risks like overvoltage, overcurrent, or short circuits</strong>.

                <p>The Borderlands franchise is known for its recurring characters, and perhaps none stand out quite as much as Claptrap. This loud and eccentric little robot has long since stood as the series' mascot for good reason, with his endearing charm and infectious good mood. But there's no denying he can be a bit loud at times--and that certainly hasn't changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>. But what if you could change that?</p><p>Claptrap may not be as prevalent in this new entry as he has been in some other titles in the looter shooter franchise, but his presence is still consistent enough in Borderlands 4 to warrant a rather unique slider among all the other settings. For those who find this quirky guy more of a nuisance than a lovable goof, Gearbox has added a way to adjust his volume separately from all other volumes. Yeah, you can shut Claptrap up altogether if you want.</p><p>We can sense your excitement, so we'll tell you how to turn down Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4.</p><h2>How to turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4</h2><p>To turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4, pause the game and head to the "Options" menu. Scroll over one time to "Audio", then select "Advanced". On this menu, scroll to the very bottom to find a setting called "Claptrap?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631"></a><figcaption>You can adjust Claptrap's volume to make him more tolerable, or you can reduce it to zero to shut him up entirely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, you can adjust Claptrap's voice to make him quieter, or you can decrease the volume to zero so you'll never hear a peep from him again. You'll still be able to read his subtitles so that you know what he's saying when you pick up certain collectibles or engage in quests with him, so you're not really missing anything by turning him all the way down.</p><p>Whether you decide to mute Claptrap is entirely up to you, but don't ever tell him you've taken these measures. He may be slightly annoying sometimes, but the poor little guy doesn't deserve to have his feelings hurt.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/amd-fsr-4/">AMD FSR 4 </a>works wonders on Steam Deck, introducing significant image quality improvements in select games that make the performance hit more than worth it in most cases.</p>



<p>New comparison videos shared online by Deck Wizard compare <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> running on Steam Deck with AMD FSR 4 and FSR 3.1.5. The side-by-side comparison of both games highlights how the new version of the upscaler, which has only recently unofficially become available on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/">Steam Deck</a>, delivers significantly cleaner and sharper image quality than its predecessor, making the performance hit well worth it in most cases. While both games are best experienced at 60 FPS - especially Stellar Blade, given its action-focused gameplay—the improvements already visible at this early stage suggest that FSR 4's implementation on the handheld platform has strong potential and may only get better with further optimization.</p>

<p>AMD FSR 4 is the first version of the upscaler to go the full <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-fidelityfx-super-resolution-ai-follows-nvidia-dlss-intel-xess-better-visual-fidelity/">"AI" route</a>, following NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS in using machine learning to improve image quality and performance of modern games. Initially only available for RX 9000 series GPUs, workarounds have been discovered to use the new version of the upscaler on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-3-gpus-run-fsr-4/">RDNA 3</a> and RDNA 2 through a leaked INT8 version of FSR 4's source code, which can be manually implemented using tools like <a href="https://github.com/optiscaler/OptiScaler">OptiScaler</a>. Although with a performance hit, the upscaler still delivers significantly better image quality on this old hardware.</p>

              <p>Yesterday, a total overhaul remastering of the original <em>Puzzle Quest</em> was released, updating the 18-year-old match-3 RPG for modern machines, incorporating all its DLCs, adding new classes and missions, and offering a new generation a chance to figure out why people got so excited about it two decades ago. Since its original release, developer Infinity Plus 2 has created multiple spin-offs and sequels, mobile juggernaut <em>Gems of War</em>, and the somewhat less well-loved freemium&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3</em>, but it’s important to know that&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>‘s origins go back much farther, all the way to the late 1980s, and a floppy disc that was thrown into a publisher’s trashcan. I spoke to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> lead developer Steve Fawkner to learn all about it.</p>  <p>When&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords</em> came out in 2007, gaming was a&nbsp;very different place. This was before your entire PC gaming catalog was on Steam—heck, this was before <em>BioShock</em> was on Steam even, the first AAA game to pioneer such a digital release—and the existence of a digital download-only game was novel. It was a space well-occupied by the likes of PopCap, with smash hits such as&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em>,&nbsp;<em>Bookworm</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peggle</em>, but it had yet to become The Next Big Thing. It was into this space that&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em> launched, a game explicitly inspired by&nbsp;<em>Bejeweled</em>, but developing the match-3 concept into a full-fledged RPG. And it was <em>huge</em>. But what tends to go forgotten, and mostly went unrealized even at the time, was that the “<em>Warlords</em>” in the game’s tagline isn’t just a bit of flavor—it’s a direct reference to Steve Fawkner’s previous gaming success story, the turn-based strategy RPG <em>Warlords</em> which launched in 1990.</p> <h2>In the trash, looking at the stars</h2> <p>“It was my eighth game at the time,” Australian developer Steve Fawkner told me over a video call. “I think my first game was ’83, about the tender age of 15. And it sold 32 copies.”</p>

 <p>That game was called&nbsp;<em>Quest for the Holy Grail</em>, released on the Spectrum 48K, the cassette given out with a note (including his home address) asking anyone who enjoyed it to mail him five dollars. 32 people sent him cash, and the bug bit him hard. He continued making games that he distributed at shows or sent to his growing mailing list, until in 1989 Fawkner created <em>Warlords </em>for the Amiga, a game that combined role-playing with turn-based strategy, and decided that, with this, he had made something of more significance. However, publishers didn’t appear to agree, and Fawkner was turned down over and over, including by his last resort, Strategic Studies Group (SSG). The president at SSG was so unimpressed he tossed the disc in the trash.</p> <p>It was only after the publishing boss saw his son playing it on his Amiga that he took more notice, and even then it was to say it “looks rubbish.” His son had fished the floppy out of the trash and installed it, and really enjoyed it. He convinced his father it was worth a look, the game got signed, and now, three sequels, a physical card game, and the spin-off <em>Warlords: Battlecry</em> series later, it’s fair to say the kid was vindicated.</p>

 <p>I was pretty shocked when Fawkner then added, “You know, at this stage, I’m pretty much done with the strategy genre. I really haven’t played the strategy genre since.” Surely you’ve played&nbsp;<em>Total War,</em> I splutter, finding it impossible that someone so significant in an entire field of games would be able to just walk away. “I snack on them,” he concedes. He’ll buy everything, play a single game of it, “literally one game, and go, ‘That’s great! I really enjoyed that! But I’m just gonna move on now.'”</p> <p>Instead, it’s puzzle games that have continued to beguile the developer (alongside “a lot of <em>Diablo”</em>) since the creation of <em>Puzzle Quest</em>. It was while playing <em>Bejeweled</em> late into the night when he was supposed to be working on&nbsp;<em>Warlords: Battlecry 4</em> that Fawkner realized there was something special here, something he wanted to work on. Originally called&nbsp;<em>Warlords: Champions</em>, his combination of match-3 and a more traditional fantasy role-playing game was in development as early as 2004. A mock-up of the systems was put together in days, then the story (set in the world of <em>Warlords</em>) was written, and the full game came together in just months. Three years later, he still hadn’t found a publisher.</p>

 <p>“I basically sold everything I could sell just to keep that development running for three years,” said Fawkner, so convinced was he that this game was something special. Eventually, Japanese publisher D3 took an interest, signed it up, and arranged for a DS port to be released alongside the PC version, with the finally released game being vastly more complex than the version quickly put together in 2004. “You give an old-school developer three years,” Fawkner laughs, “and that’s kind of what we pump out.” The lack of early interest among publishers in the end proved a massive benefit. “It actually worked in our favor, because we got to put so much into the game.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626913" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626913"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626913">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Anti-Cheat Technology</h2> <p><em>Puzzle Quest</em> uses its <em>Bejeweled</em>-style grid of gems as a means of violence. Each color of gem represents a form of mana, and eliminating them from the grid adds to your character’s mana pools, eventually allowing an ever-growing collection of spells to be triggered. Some affect the contents of the grid, others directly attack your opponent, and many more do a combination of the two. The grids also contain skulls that also launch attacks when matched, as well as gold for spending in shops, and XP for leveling up your character. It’s the complete RPG package, but played out via the puzzle format PopCap made so famous. Which is to say, it takes one of the most engaging puzzle game formats and makes it the core of an enormous fantasy story complete with quests, companions, and a big ol’ map to explore.</p>

 <p>Key to this success, and something that so many other games that have tried to mimic the success with other puzzling formats have missed, is that in&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest</em>, the enemy plays too. Instead of just hitting you with its own abilities, the CPU has to match gems as well, fill its own mana pools, and think about not leaving the grid in a shape that’s advantageous to you at the end of its turn. Which led to something most people remember about the game at the time: it always felt like it was cheating. It was not. In fact, it turns out it was doing the opposite.</p> <p>“So here’s the thing,” says Fawkner. “We did some focus testing and people were saying it felt like it was cheating, and I’m like, we want to fix that.” Wanting to know what it was that felt like cheating, Fawkner’s team tracked some stats in the game, and it turned out it was all about what they call “lucky events.” When the grid would drop in skulls to attack, or set up a four-of-a-kind match, if it happened for the player it felt natural, but if it happened for the AI it felt like cheating. From their experiments, it turns out that players need to be lucky <em>two to three times</em> more often than the CPU before a game feels fair. So, after launch, the game was patched to lower the possible luck for the AI! If the grid was due to randomly drop in three gems of the same color or a row of skulls for the AI opponent, it would occasionally switch them out for a less useful combination, but never do this for the player. So for as much as people claimed the game was rigged against them, the complete opposite was true. This in fact went further, with the AI already programmed to make mistakes and sometimes miss opportunistic turns, because as Fawkner’s team had learned from creating the famously good <em>Warlords</em> AI, the more mistakes it made, the more human it felt.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626914" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626914"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626914">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>From premium to freemium</h2> <p>20 years later, <em>Puzzle Quest</em> is still a big deal for Infinity Plus 2. People still buy the original (the excellent sequel, <em>Puzzle Quest II</em>, is no longer on sale), there are the licensed rights for games like <em>Marvel Puzzle Quest&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering – Puzzle Quest</em>, and even the lackluster <em>Puzzle Quest 3</em> chugs along well enough. Plus of course, there’s <em>Gems of War</em>.</p> <p><em>Gems of War</em> is a reinvention of <em>Puzzle Quest</em> as a free-to-play mobile game, complete with its own vast fantasy world, in which teams of four characters work together to use the grid to fire off their own abilities at AI enemies. But it’s also somewhat online, letting you sort of battle human opponents by competing against their bespoke teams controlled by the game’s AI, as well as join guilds, working toward goals, and always, always be grinding to unlock the next level or new character card. As such, with numerous in-game currencies and at least three different ongoing battle passes, <em>Gems of War</em> is a game that’s absolutely set up to milk its players for every penny. And yet, when I played it for a couple of months a few years back, I never felt inclined to buy a thing. I remember chatting with the much-missed and wonderful <em>Kotaku</em> writer Mike Fahey about this, and Fahey’s conspiratorial theory was that Infinity Plus 2 had deliberately designed the game to let people evade payments out of some objection to the whole freemium model. So I figured, heck, as a tribute to Mike, why not put this to Fawkner, no matter how awkward it might be.</p>

 <p>“He’s not entirely wrong,” Fawkner replies.</p> <p>“We wanted to make it as free as we possibly could,” the veteran developer explained. “There were certain foundations to that game. I went in saying, to do it right, I want to make sure there’s nothing in this game you can’t get if you work for it. And I want to make sure that when people are spending, they kind of feel good about the spend, like they really get something for it.” Wanting to avoid the worst of gacha games (although I should add, there <em>are</em> gacha elements where you certainly can spend money for a random chance pull), Fawkner says he believes their approach to the model is a big part of the game’s success. 11 years in, the game is still running and adding twice-weekly updates, so it’s clearly working out. “We’re doing really well,” Fawkner adds, “but it’s not and never will be a billion-dollar-a-year kind of game. I think we’re OK with that. Is there a level of frustration from our publishing partners that we weren’t greedy? Probably!”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626916" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626916"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626916">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>With a son who has spent months playing&nbsp;<em>Gems of War</em> to a ludicrously high level, I’m not sure just how innocent the game is when it comes to in-game spending, given there are a lot of nags and pop-ups, and I’ve had to say no to a lot of requests to buy stuff! (And in the interests of full disclosure, after Fawkner and I chatted and he learned that my 10-year-old was over level 600, his development team demanded he send the boy an in-game “care package,” or a bunch of free shit. He’s the corrupted one, not me.)</p>

 <p>That does bring us on to&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3</em>, another freemium game that many argue does not get the balance right. Its reviews on Steam have only just managed to scrape their way up to “Mixed” after two years of updates and changes, partly due to quite significant mechanical changes to how the game plays (you play three moves in a row, and can now move gems diagonally), and partly because of its brutal in-app purchases, which don’t sit well with players. “What we produced was not a game I’m ashamed of,” says Fawkner. “I’m very proud of it and shipped a game on time that was very playable and very pretty.” However, it was also created during the covid lockdowns, which were something that hit Australia especially hard. Months would go by during which you weren’t allowed to leave your house, and the team was scattered and scared. Fawkner told me that the office was only around the corner from his home, but getting there was sometimes impossible, with police on the streets requiring paperwork if you were caught outdoors.</p> <p>“I don’t like to blame covid,” Fawkner adds, but says it was undeniably a factor. After release, and the very negative reception, the team “struggled” for a bit. “Could we make it into the game we originally envisaged?” He mentions how the reviews have improved since then, but it remains the case that there are still fewer than 1,000 of them, and the game never peaked beyond 221 concurrent players. “People let us know how they felt,” Fawkner says, “and the message was received loud and clear.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000626915" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626915"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626915">© 505 Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>  <p>Thus a return to premium games.&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em> is a remake of the original game, somewhat based on the previous 2019 remake made for the Nintendo Switch, but built yet again, now containing the original&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Plague Lord</em> DLC, the new content created for the Switch’s&nbsp;<em>The Legend Returns</em> version, and a whole new chapter of its own. It’s faithful to the original in almost all ways, save for a big change in how the game handles a grid with no turns. What was once a “Mana Drain,” in which both sides lost all their mana for no fault of their own. “It always felt bad, right?” asks Fawkner. “It’s like, ‘I’m being punished.’ So I said, what if we make it a storm? What if, when the board locks up, it just all explodes and the mana splits between you and the enemy? Now you’ve got an abundance of mana.”</p> <p>I can report it works. The game looks great, even at ridiculous aspect ratios, and the replacement of Mana Drain is very welcome. Straight away I’ve found myself hooked on “just one more battle,” buoyed by the constant sense of both character and narrative progress, unlocking new quests and leveling up to use new spells…It’s all still there, just like in 2007, except now it’s much prettier. I cannot wait to see if it gets a release for my Android tablet, after which you may well not hear from me for a while. As it is, it’s running on my PC behind this window I’m typing into, tempting me back.</p>

 <p>Infinity Plus 2 has hopes that if&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest: Immortal Edition</em> succeeds, they will be able to do the same for&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 2</em>, and then: “What I’d really absolutely&nbsp;<em>adore</em> to do is take&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 3&nbsp;</em>and turn that into a premium version, move it back a little bit toward&nbsp;<em>Puzzle Quest 1</em> mechanics. I think that would be a really interesting project.”</p> <p>As for a possible <em>Warlords V</em>? Is Fawkner really so set to never return to the strategy? “I want to play it a little bit,” he says. “But I want to make it a lot.” Gosh. “I would love to have a team that’s making it here, me overseeing the making of it, adding some flavor. I think that would be an ideal outcome. So that could happen, you know? It’s a good old nostalgic franchise. What it probably needs is a couple of turn-based strategy games to go well, then it’s an easy pitch to the business department to say, ‘Hey, you know, we’ve got this strategy game sitting here. Lots of expertise, lots of nostalgia. You can do this.’ Lightning’s gotta strike the right place.”</p>
