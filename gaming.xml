            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p>
<h2>Unfiltered</h2>
<p>This is a significant performance impact for an app that simply runs quietly in the background for most users. The impact is roughly comparable to that of going from a top-of-the-line RTX 4070 Ti Super to an older RTX 4070 Ti or 4070 Super, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/4070-ti-super-review-faster-gpu-for-the-same-799-but-not-nvidias-best-value/">based on our earlier testing of those cards</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-dlcs-ever-released.1063983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/10-best-dlcs-ever-released/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For any fan of gaming, a great title becomes even better when it’s subjected to fantastic post-launch content – and that tends to come in the form of top-shelf DLC. This could be anything from a few missions to an entire sub-campaign some ten or fifteen hours in length. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best DLCs ever released, deciding once and for all what the greatest game expansions are. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-dlcs-ever">Best DLCs Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our representation of the best DLCs ever released in gaming – let us know in the comments if you agree with this breakdown. </p>



<h3 id="h-1-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">1. Shadow of the Erdtree (Elden Ring)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was such a phenomenal release that it became a candidate for <strong>Game of the Year</strong> at 2024’s edition of The Game Awards. This stellar piece of DLC brought millions of players back into the fold, all ready to fight notoriously difficult bosses in a brand-new section of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-blood-and-wine-the-witcher-3">2. Blood and Wine (The Witcher 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blood and Wine was effectively a ‘send-off’ for The Witcher 3, taking place long after the main story was completed (chronologically) and serving as a ‘retirement’ of sorts for our hero, Geralt of Rivia. There’s a fourth-wall break at the end of the expansion that is worthy of a chef’s kiss – one of the best DLCs ever, indeed.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-point-lookout-fallout-3">3. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout is one of the creepiest Fallout DLCs ever, plunging players into a foggy, mutant-infested backwoods county and leaving them to fend for themselves. It was one of the largest expansions Bethesda Game Studios had released at the time, boasting a wide, open map and hours of extra content for the best Fallout game ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-left-behind-last-of-us">4. Left Behind (Last of Us)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left Behind was a poignant, emotional expansion to an already heart-wrenching game. It told the backstory of Ellie and explored the journey she took before becoming bitten and discovering she was immune to the Cordyceps infection in The Last of Us. It was a perfect prequel that offered a few solid hours of gameplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-burial-at-sea-bioshock-infinite">5. Burial at Sea (BioShock Infinite)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>BioShock Infinite was released back in 2012 and at the time of writing is the last game in the series. It was a phenomenal and beautiful game that was perfectly expanded upon in Burial at Sea, a two-part DLC that spans BioShock’s in-game ‘multiverse’. It takes players back to Rapture, the instantly recognisable location from BioShock and BioShock 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-6-dragonborn-skyrim">6. Dragonborn (Skyrim)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dragonborn was a massive piece of DLC that took players from the province of Skyrim to Solstheim to face off against an ancient dragon priest with a thirst for power. In this expansion, players travel through the likes of Apocrypha, learn new and powerful abilities, and explore a sizeable and dangerous map. </p>



<h3 id="h-7-nuka-world-fallout-4">7. Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s another Fallout DLC, but honestly, Bethesda Game Studios did such a phenomenal job expanding these games that it deserves another spot on this list of the best DLCs ever. At the end of Fallout 4’s lifecycle, BGS released Nuka-World, an expansion that serves as a perfect endgame, ultimately giving players one last opportunity to make a grand choice to impact their ‘status’ in the game for the final time. </p>







<h3 id="h-8-freedom-cry-aciv-black-flag">8. Freedom Cry (ACIV: Black Flag)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Freedom Cry ultimately arrived on the scene as a standalone expansion, telling the story of Adéwalé, the strong and memorable supporting character from 2013’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. It’s one of the most impressive stories in Assassin’s Creed history, with players assuming the role of this former slave turned pirate turned assassin in an adventure that lasts a good few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-phantom-liberty-cyberpunk-2077">9. Phantom Liberty (Cyberpunk 2077)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Phantom Liberty quite literally changed the face of Cyberpunk 2077, going hand-in-hand with an update so large it was dubbed ‘Cyberpunk 2.0’. Phantom Liberty was a star-studded expansion that introduced an entirely new area of Night City and took players through a story so emotional that it broke hearts worldwide when it wrapped up.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-undead-nightmare-red-dead-redemption">10. Undead Nightmare (Red Dead Redemption)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Undead Nightmare is legendary, and these days, fans of the Red Dead Redemption franchise are wondering why Rockstar Games hasn’t released a new version for RDR2. Released in 2010, Undead Nightmare saw players revisit John Marston, gunslinger extraordinaire, as he attempts to survive a brutal and terrifying zombie outbreak. It was a brilliant expansion that boasted its unique multiplayer modes. </p>

<p>Starfield is a great game, but sometimes, using one of the title’s best commands or cheats can make it a more enjoyable experience. If you’re playing on PC, you can lean on <strong>hundreds </strong>of commands and codes to alter your game – sometimes with hilarious results., In this guide, I’m breaking down the best Starfield cheats and commands, just for you.</p>



<p>I’ll also teach you a trick that’ll allow you to unlock Starfield cheats on Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats">How to Use Starfield Cheats</h2>



<p>Call them commands, call them cheats, it doesn’t matter – they’re basically the same thing. On PC, it’s seriously easy to use Starfield commands, and it all begins with tapping the key that sits alongside the ‘1’ on the top left of your keyboard, just beneath the ESC key. It might be a tilde or it could be a ‘grave’ symbol, but whatever it is, it’ll produce the same result.</p>



<p>Once you’ve hit the right key, your on-screen console will pop up and you’ll be able to just type in the Starfield cheats you want to enable, hitting enter and applying them at will. For most of these Starfield commands, you’ll be able to type the same thing into the console again to disable them but bear in mind that any save with cheats applied will be locked out of achievements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starfield-commands">Best Starfield Commands</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are hundreds of Starfield cheats, but we’ve broken down what we think are the best ones to use.</p>



<ul>
<li>tgm (Enable godmode)</li>



<li>tdetect (NPCs won’t detect you)</li>



<li>tcl (Noclip – fly through walls)</li>



<li>kah (Kill all hostiles in the area)</li>



<li>resurrect (Resurrect targeted NPC)</li>



<li>unlock (Unlock targeted door or container)</li>



<li>showmenu sleepwaitmenu (Sleep or wait without having to have a bed or seat)</li>



<li>saq (Trigger all quests in the menu – can crash your game)</li>



<li>caq (Complete all quests – will almost certainly crash your game)</li>



<li>SetTestPlanetAndBiome (Creates a ‘test planet’ and biome for testing)</li>



<li>additem (Item ID) (Value) (Add items using a code and value – see below)</li>



<li>player.addperk (perk ID) (Add perks at will)</li>



<li>psb (Unlock all available ‘powers’)</li>



<li>tfc (Toggle free-cam to fly around the map with a camera)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-starfield-commands-item-codes">Starfield Commands – Item Codes</h3>



<p>Here are the best Starfield item codes you’ll need.</p>



<ul>
<li>Credits: 0000000F</li>



<li>Digipicks (Lockpicks): 0000000A</li>



<li>Ship Parts (Repair Ships): 0003FB19</li>



<li>Med Pack: 0000ABF9</li>



<li>Trauma Pack: 0029A847</li>



<li>Regulator (Pistol): 0002CB5F</li>



<li>Coachman (Shotgun): 0026D96B</li>



<li>Magpulse (Rifle): 23606</li>



<li>MagSniper (Sniper): 0002EB45</li>



<li>Sidestar (Pistol): 0026D95D</li>



<li>Old Earth Hunting Rifle (Sniper): 0021BBCD</li>



<li>Peacemaker Spacesuit: 0013F97D</li>



<li>Reactive Experimental Nishina Helmet: 65926</li>



<li>.27 Ammo: 002B559C</li>



<li>Caseless Shotgun Ammo: 002B4AFB</li>



<li>6.5mm Ammo: 002B5590</li>



<li>7.77mm Ammo: 0004AD3E</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats-on-xbox">How to Use Starfield Cheats on Xbox</h2>



<p>If you want to use Starfield cheats and commands on Xbox, you’ll need to have a PC – that’s the caveat at play. As Starfield is ‘Play Anywhere’, you can access your saves across the two different platforms. That means you can open Starfield on PC, enable the cheats, then boot up your save on Xbox, and the commands and cheats will still be applied. </p>



<p>Again, this will still disable achievements and can result in a corrupted save or crashed game. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contrary-to-popular-belief-final-fantasy-and-warframe-voice-actor-ben-starr-is-not-a-gerbil-breeder.1063971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ben Starr has had a wild past couple of years. A professional actor for over a decade, Starr’s star turn in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> as main character Clive Rosfield put him on the map in the world of video games, and his good looks and oddball sense of humor took things from there. He’s since <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed a sizable online following</a>, something in which he takes great pride. He also likes to mess with his fans. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Starr_(actor)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starr’s Wikipedia page</a> claims he was “president of the gerbil breeding society” at his alma mater, University of Durham. This is not, strictly speaking, true.</p><p>Starr, who has posted videos of himself as <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1752344712663417281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tifa from<em> Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, a very sexual version of <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1832784072700989503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1719716479111692583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glitched-out cube from <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>, among others, loves a good bit. So when I mentioned his Wikipedia page during an interview at a <em>Warframe: 1999</em> press event in LA last week, he happily finished my sentence for me.&nbsp;</p><p>“Gerbil breeding,” he said with a look of satisfaction on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"I did a podcast once where I said, 'You can change my Wikipedia, and I won't ever change it back. I don't really care,'" Starr told Aftermath. "And someone did. So the fact is, no one's ever changed it or checked, and I haven't changed it. I should do more due diligence, but I quite like this scenario where somebody is like 'One more question...' and I'm like 'There you go. You read my Wikipedia.' I love it."</p><p>Despite his far-reaching reputation as a vaunted gerbil breeder, Starr does not plan on ever trying his hand at turning two gerbils into significantly more.</p><p>"I would know nothing about that, and I would never want anyone to think that I would breed gerbils,” Starr said. “I love gerbils, but I think gerbils should breed by themselves of their own free will. I think gerbils should be allowed to live on their own terms. I shouldn't be their lord and savior and enforcer of breeding. I fight for the rights of all gerbils. I stand here now with gerbils in solidarity saying 'Strike, strike, strike for your rights.'"</p><p>Starr might carry himself with an air of madcap silliness, but he takes his craft extremely seriously. He views games as fertile soil for performances he couldn’t pull off anywhere else, and he’s thrilled that this industry has welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>"I'm fortunate enough to lend my, for lack of a better word, talents to really interesting explorations of the human condition, but on social media, I can be a complete idiot – to be genuine and serious and emotional and vulnerable in a game, but online, I can be a clown at the same time," he said. “I'm really excited to see where the rabbit hole goes, like taking a lot of the learnings I've been fortunate to take from film theory, from stage, to see what I can do in a performance sense – getting on the performance capture stage and seeing what I can do there and push myself in ways that I haven't done before. ... You're not restricted by the way you look. Aesthetics are not important. It's about the essence of your character and what you bring to it. It's honesty reflected in a very different way."</p><p>Starr, who’s recently landed gigs in games like <em>Warframe </em>and <em>Hades 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/ff16s-ben-starr-will-host-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting this year’s Golden Joystick awards</a>, is happy to see the video game industry shine more of a spotlight on actors.</p><p>"I think for a long time in this industry, many incredibly gifted performers have been sidelined because people don't often play games for the performance. But there's something like [<em>Warframe: 1999</em>] where they are showcasing the talent,” Starr said. “They're celebrating us as an integral part of what makes this expansion special, and it's been a really cool thing to embrace."&nbsp;</p><p>Starr does, however, wish a few select companies at the top of the food chain would do a better job of respecting the talent that lends so many games their unique voices. Striking, after all, <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t just for gerbils</a>.</p><p>"As a fan of video games, I want to see them made,” said Starr, who is based out of England and isn’t currently part of SAG-AFTRA. “But also as a person who works in [the industry], I want to see them done in a fair way that rewards the incredible amount of work that goes into performance and certainly how we can as fans engage with games, which I think more and more and more you've seen [involves voice actors]."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The nonstop barrage of jokes, then, belies Starr’s awareness of what he views as a responsibility to fans.</p><p>"There's a desire to paint fans and parasocial relationships as very dangerous things, and I get that,” he said. “I'm sure those can exist. But as a fan myself, I recognize how to interact with performers and know when to step back. I know my responsibility. It's my responsibility to let fans know that I'm engaging in a way that's healthy and in no way anything other than that. I think we get it: I'm a playful idiot. If you want to play along with me, I'm playing games with you. … How do we nod and wink and understand that, fundamentally, this is all pretend, but at the same time respect and venerate the work? It's a push and pull all the time."&nbsp;</p><p>But there is at least one place where these polarized expressions of Starr’s personality can meet in the middle, gerbil-like: He’s open to voicing a gerbil in a video game.</p><p>"If there are any developers out there who are doing any gerbil-based games, I would love to [voice them],” he said. “As you can see from my Wikipedia, I was head of the gerbil breeding society, so I know a lot about them."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix"><h3>Squid Game: Unleashed, Like Other Squid Game Spinoffs, Misses The Point</h3></a><p>Netflix's mobile game highlights how weird it is to turn Squid Game into IP</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new Unearthed Arcana for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Specifically, they have revealed official Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer playtest material, meaning the class may be returning to the game in a future supplement.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-artificer" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast has released the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer Unearthed Arcana for all users. The post includes a half-hour YouTube interview with Todd Kenrick and D&amp;D's lead designer, Jeremy Crawford.</p>

<p>The playtest material is notable since the Artificer class was absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Player Handbook</a>. This updated version of the fantasy TTRPG rules was marketed as an update and consolidation of core player options, so the community saw its omission as a slight.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-artificer-battle-smith-.jpg?itok=JCOfQ2VT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-artificer-battle-smith-.jpg?itok=bNjvSvSK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As for what has changed in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer, the Unearthed Arcana changes the main class as well as reimagines its subclasses.</p>

<p>The class's core appeal is still intact: creating gadgets and gizmos that run on magic. The big change is that magical infusions, the ability to imbue mundane items with magic abilities, have been replaced with the ability to make magic items.</p>

<p>There's still a limitation on how many can be made based on Artificer level. But being able to just make Bags of Holding or Sending Stones is a notable upgrade. Furthermore, artificers can destroy these magic items to regain spell slots in a pinch. The benefits of the 2014's Artificer infusions are now separate magic items which can be made with the 2024 Artificer's class features.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer's late-game features are also tweaked. Flash of Genius can be used in response to a dice roll failing and can be used multiple times equal to their Intelligence modifier. And Soul of Artifice doesn't require a Reaction anymore, just destroy a magic item when you drop to 0 HP and you're back in the fight with 20 HP.</p>

The Alchemist's Chemical Mastery feature has been redesigned, allowing them to cast the 2024 spell Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Armorer's Perfect Armor has gotten a damage boost. The Artillerist's Eldritch Cannons have gotten more tactical options and explosive punch. Lastly, the Battle Smith's Steel Defender has gotten some adjustments to its health and damage output.</p>

<p>The release of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer Unearthed Arcana may hint at the class returning in a future supplement. It is hard to tell since certain UA material like the Mystic class has been lost to the ages. But given the Artificer's popularity, this may hint at good things on the horizon.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this Unearthed Arcana goes live December 24, 2024.</p>

And some of these players are tired of being tossed into matches where their entire team is duelists, forcing them to play healer or tank to help balance the lineup. </p><p>One solution to this problem is a role queue. Found in games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, a role queue lets players pick a role, like tank, and then find a match that needs that specific role. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s case, this means every match has a tank, two attackers, and two healers. This should lead to more balanced teams, but the devs behind <em>Rivals </em>don’t seem interested in adding this system to the shooter.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Dot Esports</em></a></span><em>,</em> Chen said that the studio is “not considering a role queue” at the moment. </p><p>“The team’s goal is to offer a wider variety of team composition through team-up skills and their own designs, to let people play their Marvel superheroes rather than limiting players to choosing a role.” </p><p>Chen further explained that data from matches shows that <em>Rivals </em>currently doesn’t need a role queue system. </p><p>“We want people to have a Marvel experience where they’re free to select what they want. [Since the beta test earlier this year], things have been rational and within expectations. In our Competitive play recently, there is a lot of different compositions emerging from players and we’d like to continue to monitor these fun compositions and how they impact our game.” </p><p>While some might be upset that Chen and developer NetEase aren’t rushing to balance the game or add a role queue system, I’m happy to see an online multiplayer game studio step back and let things be chaotic and messy for a bit before jumping in to sand things down and make everything more fair and balanced. </p><p>One of the reasons I enjoy <em>Rivals </em>is because everyone feels powerful and matches rarely play out the same way as nearly every character seems viable with the right comp or strategy. And while a role queue might be nice in ranked mode, I hope if it is ever added, it doesn’t signal a shift to balancing all the fun out of <em>Marvel Rivals. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Especially <em>TankHead</em>, which seems like what you’d get if you set <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> in the world of <em>Wall-E</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>A successor to the 2009 cult hit <em>Eliss</em>, <em>Faraway</em> is about a shooting star charting the cosmos while chasing high scores and vibing out to a soundtrack that reminds me of <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em>.  The whole game is operated with a single button input as you use gravity wells to slingshot your way around celestial bodies. “Let me teach you something about infinity,” says the game’s creator.

Do you think the company cares as much about the rights of <em>other </em>people's games on their platforms?</p><p>Hrm, I dunno, let's take a look. Anyone who's tried to wade through the garbage prominently available on the eShop would already have some doubts about the company’s standards on that front already, but for a more specific case study, check this out:</p><figure></figure><p>On the top left is <em>Unpacking</em>, which is a very good video game. The next five games are most definitely not <em>Unpacking</em>, even though their key art makes them very much look like it. They're not made by the same team, they're not continuations or sequels, they're just some slop--seemingly using AI art on the thumbnails, no less--made to try to cash in on the established game's brand.</p><p>That's some mobile gaming-type bullshit. Surely Nintendo--with the company's history of quality control and video game litigiousness--would not allow such a thing? Like, if <em>Super Mario Galaxy's</em> shop listing was immediately followed by an AI-generated thumbnail for <em>Super Mario Galaxy: New Chapters</em>, someone would end up either bankrupted or strangled and stuffed in the back of a black Toyota Crown.</p><p>Here, though, even <em>Unpacking's </em>creators are being left on read.

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> has a bit of a loading screen problem. Players will naturally experience loading screens when fast traveling, but will also be met with them when entering or exiting their ship, entering or exiting buildings, entering or exiting areas <em>within</em> certain buildings, and the list doesn't stop there. But players may be surprised to learn that these loading screens actually weren't implemented until quite late in the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of those [loading screens] were not there when I had been working on it, and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were," ex-Starfield developer Nate Purkeypile explains in an upcoming episode of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4z0BGj2zmTceUpoQ8W" rel="nofollow ">VideoGamer Podcast</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Purkeypile left Bethesda in 2021 after 14 years with the company, and says he was shocked by the amount of loading screens in the final version of the game. He says the number of loading zones in the self-contained cyberpunk city of Neon was especially surprising, in part because there were so few of them there before the game's lighting engine was finished.</p><p dir="ltr">"It could have existed without those [loading screens],” Purkeypile said. "A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon. For New Atlantis, I think it's just to make it so you don't have to sit there for the entire train ride."</p><p dir="ltr">Purkeypile did note that some of the problem was "inherent to the Creation Engine and the way it works," referencing Bethesda's decision to stick with an engine some have argued was outdated and ill-suited to the task of holding together a galaxy-sized game.</p>
