			<p>With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/ai/">Generative AI (GenAI)</a></strong> remaining the most controversial topic in the video game industry, any mention of GenAI or AI in general is making the hair on players' arms stand up. The latest occurrence of this comes from <strong>Genshin Impact</strong> players looking a little more closely at <strong>Hoyoverse's</strong> recent updates to the popular free-to-play game's Privacy Policy, which appears to have indicated that unless players opt-out, Hoyoverse will collect players' <strong>in-game voice chat data</strong> to train an internal AI model.</p>



<p>Initially spotted on a now-removed Reddit post, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cevian.bsky.social/post/3mfnpxo44xc2u">Bluesky user Cevian</a> shared a change to Genshin Impact's privacy policy that was made as recently as <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/company/privacy"><strong>January 14, 2026</strong>.</a> The change specifically referred to a clause from Section 1, subsection XVIII, being removed, which read, "<em>Where applicable, our services may offer voice-based chat functions that allow users to communicate with others in real time using voice. If you choose to use such features, <strong>we may process voice communication data</strong> for the purposes described in Section 2 and Section 13 of this Privacy Policy, including providing communication services, maintaining service security and stability, content moderation, and complying with applicable laws and regulations.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, with the above section removed, Section 2 of the Privacy Policy, titled "<em>Why We Collect and Process Your Personal Data</em>," simply reads:</p>



<p>"<em><strong>Like many AI-powered experiences, we may use your user-generated input such as chat data to train and improve the model that we use to provide our Services. You can opt-out of model training anytime in your Service-related settings. Opting out will not affect your existing gameplay.</strong></em>"</p>



<p>It's worth noting that the now-removed subsection XVIII statement is referring to Hoyoverse using the data it collects for things like improving its customer support and its moderation efforts. Essentially, there's no indication that Hoyoverse is using this data to train an internal GenAI model, which appears to be part of the concern players had when this policy was first spotted.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Hoyoverse for a comment on the situation, and despite the fact that it doesn't appear to be the case that Hoyoverse would be using this data for anything unsavory, the concern players have seems to mostly come from a feature like this being on by default, with users having to manually opt out.</p>



<p>That's what caused players to have issues with <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-training-gaming-copilot-ai-watching-you-play-games-unless-you-turn-it-off/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> <strong>Copilot Gaming AI</strong></a>, which added an 'on-by-default' feature that initially appeared to be recording your gameplay to train Copilot. That wasn't <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">exactly the case</a>, but the fact that it was on automatically, without players being sufficiently asked about it in the first place, is what caused the uproar around it. And it's worth betting that people would care more about their voices being recorded without their knowledge or proper consent, over some of their gameplay footage.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll have some word from Hoyoverse soon to properly explain the situation.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/electronic-arts/" id="52204">Electronic Arts </a>has unfortunately announced layoffs for the makers of Skate.</p>



<p>On February 25, 2026, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Electronic Arts issued a statement </a>announcing that it is reshaping the studio behind Skate, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/full-circle/" id="96165">Full Circle</a>. In their statement, they announced that they are changing the team structure and “some roles will be impacted.” The company’s statement does not specify how widespread the restructuring will be or how many roles will be affected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/skate/" id="352">Skate </a>launched in Early Access in September 2025.</p>



<p>The Full Circle statement, however, states that the decision is not a reflection on those affected and that they will support them through their transition.</p>



<p>“Our work on skate. continues. We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you. Our commitment to skate., and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong.”</p>



<h2 id="h-layoffs-and-restructurings-are-a-common-theme-in-2026-s-video-game-industry">Layoffs and Restructurings Are a Common Theme in 2026’s Video Game Industry</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, several studios have been making similar statements about layoffs and major restructurings lately. Riot Games recently severely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">downsized to restructure the team around 2XKO</a>. Highguard’s development team was also<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Why-Highguard-Failed-Highguard-Layoffs-Explained-guide.jpg" id="176090"> heavily restructured</a> less than a month after the game’s release.</p>



<p>Ubisoft continues to make major changes and is restructuring its teams moving forward. Several game projects were canceled, including the much-anticipated remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Learn more about those canceled projects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/six-games-ubisoft-canceled/" id="176792">here</a>.</p>







<p>Microsoft Gaming and Xbox are also in the midst of a massive restructuring, following Phil Spencer’s retirement and Sarah Bond’s resignation. However, while there have been major changes to the Xbox executive team, no major in-house studio shakeups are planned. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-says-no-layoffs-coming-after-executive-shakeup/" id="178362">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Wrestler provided motion capture for the latest DLC.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 17, Street Fighter 6 is getting a new DLC character: the pro wrestling-inspired Alex, and All Elite Wrestling's own Kenny Omega is the man behind the motion capture. At IGN Fan Fest 2026, he explained how the opportunity to do the motion capture actually came out of a simple misunderstanding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When the news broke and they told me, we signed the NDAs and we know who the characters are and Alex will, in fact, be one of them. And they said, 'For you being such a good sport, it'd be cool if we put a move of yours in,' maybe one or two or a taunt or something," Omega told IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had said, 'Wow, that would be great. I just don't know when I could fit that into my schedule to do the mocap for it.' And they'd said, 'Oh, wait, you do the mocap for it?' I said, 'Yeah, is that what you were talking about, or no?' They said, 'Oh my, if you would do the mocap for it, that would be awesome.' And so a misunderstanding on my part is what led to me actually going to the studio and doing a slew of mocap for the character. If there was ever a better time to be stupid, that was one of them, because it worked out in my favor completely to not understand what they were talking about at that moment. So because of that one discussion, I got invited back to the next year's Tokyo Game Show. And then before doing the game show, I stopped over at Osaka, where they do the mocap for Capcom. And we hammered it out in one day. It was a grueling 10- or 11-hour shoot. I remember losing like 8 or 9 pounds of water weight, but it was so worth it and so fun." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also revealed that the developers were open to suggestions – he can see how his ideas were incorporated into the final game animations – and that wrestling without an audience wasn't as alien of an experience as people might expect. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think because of COVID, I got used to wrestling and performing in front of no one. It reminded me of being back into an empty arena and just having cameras all around me, but there's no sound. There's no adulation. There's no people. I see staff here and there, but it brought back memories of the COVID era, for sure."   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex first appeared in 1997 Street Fighter III: New Generation in arcades. Early concept art shows the professional wrestler character was initially positioned as the new face of the franchise. In Street Fighter 6, his super moves include Raging Spear, Sledgecross Hammer, and The Final Prison.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Discord co-founder and chief technology officer Stanislav Vishnevskiy has announced the company is delaying the global rollout of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-mandatory-age-verification-sensitive-content-teen-by-default">controversial age verification requirements</a>, admitting it "missed the mark".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Discord revealed it would begin a "phased global rollout" of a new update in March that would give all new and existing users a "teen-appropriate experience" by default. Essentially, this meant many of the platform's features - including access to age-gated channels, servers, app commands, and "sensitive content" - would be heavily restricted unless users had been age verified. This, the company said at the time, would enable it to give "teens strong protections while allowing verified adults flexibility".
</p>
<p>
The outcry was swift, with some raising the spectre of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-customer-service-system-breached-by-authorised-party-gaining-access-to-a-small-number-of-government-id-images">last year's Discord security breach</a>, which saw hackers successfully acquiring an unspecified number of users' personal data, including government IDs. And Discord has now acknowledged users concerns, pausing its rollout until a later date.
</p>
<p>
"The way this [announcement] landed," Vishnevskiy wrote in a <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">new blog post</a>, "many of you walked away thinking we're requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That's not what's happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we're doing and why. That's on us. On top of that, many of you are worried that this is just another big tech company finding new ways to collect your personal data. That we're creating a problem to justify invasive solutions... But that's not what we're doing."
</p><p>
"We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you," Vishnevskiy continued. "We also know these changes carry different weight for different communities, and that for some, questions of privacy and identity aren't just preferences but safety concerns shaped by real experience. That's not lost on us, and it directly informs the choices we're making."
</p>
<p>
In an effort to offer clarity on Discord's previous announcement, Vishnevskiy says most users - even those wanting to access age-restricted content - will never need to submit video selfies for facial age estimation, or supply identification documents to Discord's vendor partners. Rather, the company's own internal systems will attempt to automatically determine a user's age, based on the time their account has existed, any payment method on file, the types of servers they're in, and general patterns of account activity.
</p>
<p>
Less than 10 percent of users, he claims, will need to undergo alternative age verification methods to access age-restricted content. This may be because Discord's systems can't confirm they're an adult or because local laws - such as those in the UK and Australia - explicitly require facial age estimation or ID checks. For those users needing to be verified by a third party, Vishnevskiy acknowledges there may be scepticism around "how we handle partnerships", particularly in light of last year's security breach. However, he insists Discord no longer works with the company involved in that incident and pledges to publish every verification vendor it works with - alongside their data handling practices - while also providing users with choices about the vendors they use.
</p>
<p>
This vendor transparency will be part of changes Discord is making to its global age verification rollout, which has now been delayed into the second half of this year. Vishnevskiy says the company won't work with vendors whose facial age estimation is not performed entirely on-device, and that alternative verification options, including credit card verification, will be added before rollout. Elsewhere, it's launching a new "spoiler" channel for servers that have previously utilised age-restricted channels as a way of separating users from non-adult topics they "may prefer to engage with on their own terms". It'll also publish a technical blog before rollout making it clear how its automatic age determination systems work, and will include information - on the number of users asked to age verify, the methods used, and how often Discord's automated systems handled verification - in its transparency reports. 
</p><p>
What it won't do, however, is halt the rollout entirely. As Vishnevskiy explains, "The number of teenagers on Discord has significantly increased since the pandemic, and they deserve an experience appropriate to their age. At the same time, we believe adults should be able to have a full content experience on Discord. Doing both responsibly means having safeguards that help ensure age-restricted content stays in adult spaces."
</p>
<p>
It's currently unclear how - or indeed if - the changes announced by Vishnevskiy will impact countries like the UK and Australia, which explicitly mandate facial age estimation or ID checks for adult content. Already, Discord has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">generated a second wave of controversy</a> in the UK after it launched an "experiment" that would see age verification data leaving users' phones, despite previously stating otherwise. There's been additional concern over Discord's decision to use Persona as the vending partner for its "experiment". Persona has funding ties with Peter Thiel, whose data and surveillance company Palantir is currently used by US federal agencies, <a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/">including ICE</a>.

			<p>Last year, <strong>EA</strong> brought back one of its most beloved franchises from the seventh generation of consoles with the return of <strong>Skate</strong>. It was absolutely not the <strong>Skate 4</strong> that fans of the series had hoped they might get one day. It was EA's attempt at turning the franchise into a live service game that could churn out cash for the publisher, and despite it being the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/top-3-best-selling-aaa-pc-console-games-all-ea-games-battlefield-6-ea-fc-25-ea-fc-26/">most-downloaded free-to-play PC and console game</a></strong> in 2025 according to a new Sensor Tower report, less than six months from its launch, developer <strong>Full Circle</strong> has been impacted by <strong>layoffs</strong>.</p>



<p>A statement from the studio on its <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">official website</a> announced the cuts, though in the standard style of these kinds of announcements, it does not specify how many developers were impacted or provide any real clarity behind the decision to make these cuts. </p>



<p>"<em>Since launching Early Access in September, tens of millions of you have stepped into San Vansterdam</em>," the statement begins. "<em>Your passion, creativity, and feedback have reinforced our belief in what skate. can become. As skate. continues to evolve, we’re transforming as a studio. We’re reshaping Full Circle to better support skate.’s long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most to you - and making those things great</em>."</p>



<p>"<em><strong>These shifts mean making changes to our team structure, and some roles will be impacted.</strong> The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of skate. Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today. This decision is not a reflection of their impact and we’re committed to supporting them through this transition.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>EA was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-spent-most-on-ads-2025-ea-biggest-publisher-game-downloads-pc-console-ps5-xbox-steam/">biggest publisher by game downloads in the PC and console space last year</a>. It had all three of the top-selling AAA PC and console games in its portfolio, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/"><strong>Battlefield 6</strong> </a>ahead of everything else in a year when shooters and action games were the most popular genres. </p>



<p>While it's always a bit mind-boggling to see major publishers lay off developers while they're having a strong commercial year, one likely factor in this instance of it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-shareholders-officially-approved-55bn-sale-to-saudi-arabia-pif-silver-lake/">not-yet-official <strong>buyout of EA</strong> by the <strong>Saudi Arabia PIF</strong> and <strong>Silver Lake</strong></a>. The <strong>$20B</strong> of debt EA will take on as part of the deal, should it go through, has been identified by several analysts as <a href="https://wccftech.com/20-billion-debt-ticking-time-bomb-ea-studios-says-analyst/">a "<em>ticking time bomb</em>" for layoffs</a>, and this could just be the first of many to come from EA this year in preparation and anticipation of the deal going through.</p>



<p>Which is not yet a guarantee, as it still has to get approval from several global regulatory bodies, including the US's <strong>FTC</strong>. Members of Congress in the States have <a href="https://wccftech.com/46-congress-members-express-serious-concerns-over-ea-saudi-arabia-buyout-ftc/">already petitioned the FTC to take extra care when scrutinizing this deal,</a> and it'll be interesting to see whether the FTC tries to fight it like it did <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-us-federal-trade-commission-v-microsoft-over-the-activision-blizzard-deal-has-come-to-an-end-the-ftc-officially-drops-the-case/">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</a></strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Reactive Medieval Fantasy World” Valorborn From Laps Games Arrives in Early Access in April 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/valorborn-release-date-early-access-medieval-fantasy-rpg-laps-games/</link>
            <guid>1446334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valorborn</strong>, the upcoming open-world sandbox RPG that developer <strong>Laps Games</strong> describes as a "<em>dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility</em>," officially has an early access release date. It'll arrive on PC first through Steam, and it'll be out in early access on <strong>April 15, 2026.</strong> </p>



<p>Sim and city-building fans may already recognize Laps Games as the developer behind <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1981570/Land_of_the_Vikings/">Land of the Vikings</a></strong>, the 2023 strategy city-building sim that lets you create intricate Viking colonies and challenges you to lead your people through difficult winters, military expeditions, all while managing resources so your colony can thrive instead of just getting by.</p>



<p>Valorborn zooms its focus in on your individual character rather than an entire colony, with emergent storytelling that evolves depending on where you choose to explore. It's a world that'll continue to grow and evolve with or without you, with villagers in their routines, different factions constantly vying for power on their own clock, and a shifting world that may seem safe when you leave it only for its most dangerous elements to be right on your doorstep when you return.</p>



<p>When it arrives in early access, you'll be able to start your journey in <strong>Thareon</strong>, the first major kingdom you'll be able to explore. Thareon is one of several kingdoms that were part of the <strong>Allarion Empire</strong>, with your journey kicking off just after the fall of the Allarion Empire. More kingdoms within the fallen empire will be made available as the game continues to grow and develop, and each will bring its own unique quirks and customs, like how the worst crime you can commit in Thareon is practicing magic. A significant contradiction to the fact that magic was once a significant part of Allarion, and remains a significant force in the world.</p>



<p>Because Valorborn is a game that moves on even when you're not playing, with you driving your own path, one of its more significant elements is <strong>permadeath</strong>. Laps Games calls it a <strong>core feature</strong> in the game's design, forcing you to think very carefully about how you move through the world, whether you've chosen to be a sword-for-hire, a thief, a hunter, a lone traveler or a member of a larger party.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Valorborn</em>&nbsp;is an ambitious project for us, and it was made possible by the support we received for&nbsp;<em>Land of the Vikings</em>," said Laps Games founder <strong>Onurhan Akçay,</strong> in a press release. "<em>That support gave us the foundation to build something bigger and more systemic. With&nbsp;Valorborn</em>, <em>we wanted to create a world where players can truly choose their own path and write their own stories. A lot of our inspiration comes from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-qa-interview-with-taleworlds-entertainment/">Mount &amp; Blade</a>,&nbsp;Wartales, and&nbsp;Kenshi, and from worlds like&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">The Lord</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">of the Rings</a>. Those inspirations helped shape the kind of experience we wanted to make, a dangerous, reactive medieval fantasy world full of freedom, tension, and possibility.</em>"</p>

<p>Laps Games also says that <em>Valorborn</em>'s world will be fully realized, which means that "every building, cave, and point of interest is fully enterable" and there will be "no fake doors or decorative entrances".</p><p>You'll be able to choose on what level you want to engage with <em>Valorborn</em>.

Bear in mind, though, that this is very much a single-player project, so you won't be able to play alongside your friends.</p><p>According to Laps Games, permadeath will be "a core part of the experience" in <em>Valorborn</em>, but setbacks are intended to be "part of each player's story rather than a dead end".</p>
<p>Over the course of <em>Valorborn</em>'s time in Early Access, you can expect more kingdoms to explore, more starting options for new journeys, and "more ways for adventurers to define their own origin".</p><p><em>Valorborn </em>arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3372530/Valorborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 15th.

              <p>Another AA publisher is hanging on for dear life. Amazon continues to flee AAA gaming like it didn’t just make $77 billion in net income last year. And a $20 million fine on Reddit shows why the scourge of online age-verification requirements has become such a messy fight. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Were you waiting for the right time to check out <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>? It was a lot of fun and <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432">is about to get new DLC</a>.</p> <p>I’m still trying to read the finely crumbled tea leaves in the new CEO of Xbox’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">first big interview since taking over</a>. She promises AI won’t displace creativity and that nothing is off the table in terms of a rethink. But she’s also waiting to complete a listening tour before deciding what to change. Matt Booty, meanwhile, promises first-party development remains a key pillar of Microsoft Gaming, including small indie games like Double Fine’s <em>Keeper</em>. Only one thing is for certain: Xbox’s Major Nelson is <a href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/2026423036908618209">ready to report back for duty</a>.</p>

 <h2>Nacon has some overdue bills</h2> <p>The French publisher announced it doesn’t currently have enough cash to pay its debts, leading it to file for insolvency, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nacon-files-for-insolvency-says-its-assessing-all-possible-solutions-to-continue-running/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. It says the “procedure will enable the company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” It recently released the underwhelming <i>Styx: Blades of Greed</i> and is preparing for the launch of the troubled RPG sequel <em>Greedfall 2</em> in March.</p> <p>Last year it published <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a grim but novel Soulslike that received a fair amount of praise but not much wider attention. It follows an AWOL military operative searching for his family in a war-torn country infested with supernatural beings. Unlike most modern games, it eschewed clear objectives and quest markers, which some found refreshing and others found tedious.</p>

 <p>Nacon was also set to publish <i>Terminator: Survivors</i> last year but the game was unexpectedly delayed indefinitely. The survival shooter also dropped its plans for Early Access and multiplayer co-op.</p> <h2>Amazon abandon’s <em>Forza Horizon</em> director’s new open-world game</h2> <p>UK developer Maverick Games is no longer working with Amazon, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. The studio was cofounded in 2022 by former <em>Forza Horizon</em> creative director Mike Brown to make a AAA narrative-led game, with the tech giant signed on to publish. It’s unclear what will happen if the team doesn’t find a new partner. “Development of our debut title continues to progress as strongly as planned,” Maverick Games said. “We’re in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

 <h2>Xbox cloud gaming gets an upgrade on console</h2> <p>“We’re now rolling out up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members, delivering sharper visuals and more responsive gameplay across supported titles and regions,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/february-xbox-update-1440p-streaming-rog-xbox-ally-updates-and-more/">new post on Xbox Wire</a>. A bunch of updates have also been rolled out to the Xbox PC gaming app to make navigation feel more responsive.</p> <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> lawsuit gets dismissed</h2> <p>Filed earlier this year, it accused Hasbro executives of misleading investors about the sustainability of the card game’s profits and alleged that overprinting was happening despite the known harm it would do to the brand. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-hasbro-2026-lawsuit-magic-card-overproduction/"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> it was voluntarily withdrawn while another shareholder lawsuit continues. Hasbro previously said the claims had no merit.</p>

 <h2>Reddit gets fined nearly $20 million over child privacy issues</h2> <p>UK regulators said the company shirked its responsibility to know which of its users were 13 or younger and handle any personal information collected accordingly (via <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx0xggepjo">the <em>BBC</em></a>). It’s one of the regulatory pressures leading companies like Reddit, Discord, and others to implement AI age checks which are in turn making users mad. “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety,” a spokesperson for Reddit said.

            <title><![CDATA[Hades 2 Devs Pleased To See Players ‘Engaging’ With Narrative, Even If They’re Disappointed]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/hades-2-supergiant-narrative-interview-ending-changes/</link>
            <guid>1446295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>After a <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-technical-test-early-access-impressions/"><u>fittingly shifting</u></a> early access period, <em>Hades 2</em> released last fall to largely raucous applause. But there was one sticking point – or rather, a handful that coalesced into a larger whole like <a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-pet-the-dog/"><u>our dear good boy Cerberus</u></a>: the narrative, previously incomplete, built to a conclusion that to some <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hades-2-ending-explained-chronos-zagreus-melinoe-epilogue/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>felt unsatisfying</u></a>. So Supergiant patched it in an effort to provide greater closure for all involved. The decision, says creative director Greg Kasavin, was a no-brainer despite coming <em>after </em>the early access period rather than during, but he’s also made his peace with the fact that not everybody’s on board with where the game’s larger-than-life tale of gods, titans, and fates ultimately ended up.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Spoilers for Hades 2 follow.</em></p><p><em>Hades 2</em>’s ending presented players with a plethora of potential quibbles, but many found themselves inconsolably at odds with the fact that Zagreus, main character Melinoë’s brother and hero of <em>Hades 1</em>, as opposed to Melinoë herself, made the extremely consequential decision to show compassion to a past version of <em>Hades 2</em>’s central villain, Chronos, thus forcing Melinoë to abandon her lifelong mission of scattering the conniving titan to the sands of time in favor of bonding with a suddenly remorseful version of him. This, in some players’ minds, did not feel true to Melinoë’s character, stealing agency from her and robbing her of retribution following a lifetime of injustice. The updated version allowed Melinoë to make that call herself and dropped in additional scenes supporting it, showing rather than telling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At DICE in Las Vegas earlier this month, Kasavin explained that the eleventh hour decision to reconfigure an ending years in the making – a rarity for narrative-driven games despite high-profile instances like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3_ending_controversy?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s controversial ending overhaul</u></a> – came after only a small amount of consternation.&nbsp;</p><p>"I mean, of course if all of us had perfect foresight, we would make all sorts of decisions differently throughout life, but none of us are so fortunate,” Kasavin told Aftermath when asked if he had any regrets stemming from the original version of<em> Hades 2</em>’s ending. “[But] when you're making an early access game, it's almost like you've created a contract with you and your players. We're working in partnership with our players and we're taking their feedback and synthesizing it as part of what we want to accomplish and make something that is true to our vision while also hopefully being as satisfying as possible to our player base. The decision about the ending, in many respects, was very straightforward because it was simply the same process we've used all throughout: We get feedback, we consider it, and then we ask ourselves 'Is there something we can do to address it?' It just so happened that this related to a part of the story, and it was after version 1.0 rather than before."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Tweaking the ending, then, felt natural, especially considering who much of the criticism was coming from.</p><p>"We made the decision [to change the ending] really quickly,” Kasavin said. “We knew that we wanted to do something because we knew players had really high expectations – particularly our early access players, who played a lot of the first game and also this game in early access. They had good feedback, as they did all throughout early access."</p><p>Reactions to the 2.0 version of <em>Hades 2</em> 1.0’s ending have been <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hades/i-was-one-of-the-first-to-see-hades-2s-true-ending-and-i-dont-know-how-i-feel-about-supergiant-retconning-the-whole-thing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mixed</u></a>. Some feel that Supergiant’s effort to fill in blanks helps sell a once-rushed face turn, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1outvpc/comparing_the_newold_endings_analyzing/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">fleshing out multiple characters</a> en route to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hades-2-ending-update-melinoe-zagreus-switch-2/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a legitimately heartwarming finale</u></a>. But much ink was spilled before and after the patch about larger narrative issues, especially in terms of Melinoë’s<a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending/"><u> inability to budge a Sisyphean status quo</u></a> that Zagreus at least made a (or several hundred) run(s) at marginally improving. The game’s cast, as a result, winds up feeling static – bland, even. There’s also the matter of <em>Hades 2</em>’s grander endgame ambitions: a reckoning with the idea of fate itself that catches gods and mortals alike in its sweeping net while shunting Melinoë’s more personal concerns off to the side. As <a href="https://defector.com/hades-ii-is-at-war-with-itself?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Defector pointed out</u></a>, <em>Hades 2</em> is ultimately at odds with its own structure, attempting to depict seismic change within a framework of necessary repetition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kasavin has heard the criticisms and, indeed, sought them out. But when it comes to engaging with articles, videos, and comments directly, he prefers to let the game do the talking.</p><p>“We welcome criticism of our work and read all of it that we can find,” Kasavin said. “We feel our work ultimately needs to speak for itself. If nothing else, discussions around the themes, characters, and broader differences between the two games suggest to us that players are engaging with the work, which is great.”</p><p>Kasavin also recognizes that the original <em>Hades</em>, a record-breaking roguelite that has spawned countless imitators, was always going to be a tough act to follow – even for himself, the guy who directed it.</p><p>"We didn't have a lot of room to make something where people would be like 'Oh wow, that just blew the previous game out of the water,' because [the original] <em>Hades </em>won more than 70 game of the year awards and exceeded our wildest expectations,” he said. “We wanted to make something that was on the level and had its own distinct identity – that could assert itself. We knew that players would compare and contrast. They would contrast Melinoë to Zagreus."</p><p>"For some people, [<em>Hades 2</em>] lands really well,” he added. “For other people, their memory of the original is so strong that it may not pass it, and that's all OK. ... We've been fortunate to have worked on games that, one after another, have been able to strike a chord with people at their own point in time. We have never endeavored to tell our players that a game will be better than the last one, because if you got a tattoo of <em>Hades</em>, who are we to tell you that this game is going to be even better than that? You're at a different point in time; you have different expectations, and we try not to pressure ourselves into making something that would be better for everyone in that way. But of course, we don't want to disappoint people either."</p><p>So of course, Supergiant’s next project is going to be a sequel to its real best game, <em>Pyre</em>, right?</p><p>"Who knows?" Kasavin replied with a laugh. "We have no idea right now. We never even begin to think about what our next game is until the dust has settled on the one that we've been working on. How we feel at the end of that process is really important to where we go next."</p><p>Ideally, though, Supergiant’s core crew – who’ve been together since the beginning, practically a miracle in the modern video game industry – will figure it out together.</p><p>"Our ambitions, such as they are, are simply to be able to make another game after the one that we work on," said Kasavin. "We like working together. We think that the creative chemistry we have is why our games have been well received. Each of us have experienced our greatest successes working together. So we have all reasoned that we are greater than the sum of our parts. Supergiant is more than 25 people now, but we're on the relatively smaller side for a studio that's been around 15 [or] 16 years. A goal of ours is just to be able to keep doing this for the long haul. It doesn't mean it will happen; people go through their different life changes. But we as a team try to do the best we can to support one another and keep doing what we're doing because we love it. We wish we could do it forever."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-ending/"><div><p>Hades 2’s Story Doesn’t Change The Status Quo - Aftermath</p><p>Melinoë’s journey is more about acceptance than change</p><p><span>Jay Castello</span></p></div></a></figure>

			<p>One of the best <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/"><strong>action games</strong> of 2025</a> and the return of one of the best action series in video games last year, <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, will get its first major <strong>DLC</strong> release <strong>next week</strong>, with the arrival of its previously announced <strong>The Two Masters</strong> DLC on <strong>March 4, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>The confirmation of its release date comes after we previously learned that the DLC would arrive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-get-two-masters-dlc-early-2026/">sometime in early 2026.</a> Announced in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/ninja-gaiden-4-the-two-masters-dlc-release-date/">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, we also got a new look at gameplay from the DLC, which adds two new weapons (one for Ryu and one for Yakumo), three new chapters, and plenty of new enemies to slice through.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>This story-driven expansion continues Yakumo and Ryu’s battle against fiends that once again threaten to take over the world</em>," the blog post reads. "<em>&nbsp;After completing the main story, players will unlock new story chapters that push both characters into battles against even deadlier enemies, challenging bosses, and new trials that will test the skills of even the most seasoned master ninja.</em>"</p>



<p>Ryu is getting a new <strong>Jakotsumon</strong> serpent gauntlets as his new weapon, while Yakumo will be able to wield a new <strong>Solitaire</strong> scythe. You'll be able to test these weapons and put your ninja skills to the limit in the additional story content added in the DLC, and in the main campaign by around the halfway point. While you'll need to beat the main story to access the DLC chapters, you won't have to beat the story to get your hands on the new DLC weapons.</p>



<p> You'll also be able to test the new weapons out in a brand new "<em>endurance-style mode</em>" called <strong>Abyssal Road</strong>, where success is measured by your ability to survive waves of combat encounters that get more and more difficult.</p>



<p>Part of the increased difficulty comes from new <strong>Special Blood Essence</strong> and <strong>Frenzied</strong> enemy mechanics that shake things up compared to what you got used to over the course of the rest of the game. There are also new bosses and enemies to face, though it seems like we'll have to encounter them in the DLC to learn about them, as Team NINJA doesn't go into any detail about the creatures that will try to get in Ryu and Yakumo's way.</p>



<p>Lastly, along with the new content, Team NINJA is also including a slew of quality-of-life updates and bug fixes that we'll hopefully learn more about next week when the update arrives. If you already own Ninja Gaiden 4 and want to grab the DLC, it'll run you an extra <strong>$14.99</strong> on its own, while the upgrade to the Digital Deluxe version of the game, which includes the DLC and a few in-game cosmetics, costs <strong>$20.</strong></p>



<p>That said, it is currently on sale on both <strong>PlayStation</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong>, with the deluxe edition of the game on sale for <strong>35% off</strong> on both platforms, and if you already have the game, the deluxe edition upgrade is <strong>25% off</strong> on both platforms. The only platform where it's not on sale, at least at the time of this writing, is Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo may have announced their latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> supplement earlier than expected. Their website recently listed the new book, <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>, but has recently removed the announcement. In that brief time, however, details were gleamed.</p><h2>The <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em> Announcement and Removal</h2><p>According to the keen reporting of <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/paizo-accidentally-reveals-pathfinder-feybound-book.718090/" rel="nofollow">EN World's</a> Christian Hoffer, Paizo posted on their website details on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. As the name implies, the book is a Fey-themed supplement for the world of Golarion, giving adventurers and GMs further insight and knowledge about the beings of fairy tales.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-nixie-fey-artwork.jpg?itok=pVnBISOg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="700" height="812">

  </picture><p>Unfortunately, further information on the book is scarce. But, since this is the internet, some details have made it out into the wild. This includes the book including a gazetteer on the First World: the infinite plane of wilderness home to traveling faerie courts and extreme, unpredictable weather, and new information on the Eldest, the ancient godlike beings who reside there.</p><p>As for player options, the book will contain new fey-themed character archetypes and new fey ancestries like the faun, nymph, gremlin, and sprite. There are also new fadrim versatile heritages, allowing you to add a bit of fey magic to other characters. Lastly, the book will contain new spells, including curses, transformations, and memory manipulation.</p><p>For now, that is all that is available on <em>Pathfinder: Feybound</em>. Links to the book's listing go to a dead page. No MSRP. No release date. It can be speculated that book may be part of an upcoming Paizo Live stream, which highlights upcoming adventure paths and supplements for the game.</p><p>This makes sense since the book marks the debut of fey material in <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em>. Which is made more intriguing since the prior edition was light on fey-material. There were a handful of adventure paths featuring fey, but that's about it. By contrast, getting a setting on the level of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pathfinder-lost-omens-highhelm-review" rel="nofollow">Highhelm</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-returns-to-tian-xia-this-october" rel="nofollow"><em>Tian Xia</em></a> &nbsp;is sure to make fans excited to learn more.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-switch-2-port-60-fps-40-30-performance-review-skyrim-bethesda-2000673651</link>
            <guid>1446271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> is out now on the Nintendo Switch 2. And after the rough release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 late last year</a>, I was nervous about how Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic RPG would fare on Nintendo’s hybrid machine. Turns out, I had nothing to fear as <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is totally solid. Not perfect, but pretty damn good.</p> <p>Launched on February 24, <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first mainline <em>Fallout</em> game to grace a Nintendo platform. (No, <em>Fallout Shelter</em> and <em>Fallout</em> pinball don’t count.) This version of the 2015 open-world blockbuster RPG contains all the DLC as well as a ton of extra Creation Club content, too. It also launched with not one, but three different framerate options, including a 60FPS option, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">which was lacking when <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> launched on Switch 2 last year.</a> And thankfully, according to many online who have played the new port,<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 performs very well.</p>

  <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s visual options on Switch 2</h2> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 includes three modes: a 60FPS performance option, a 30FPS visual mode, and a 40FPS visual mode. Online testing shows that in both handheld and portable, <em>Fallout 4</em> mostly sticks to these target framerates.</p> <p>There is one caveat: the 60FPs option can look really blurry in some areas. This is due to the lower resolution that <em>Fallout 4</em> can reach in its performance mode, especially in busy, outdoor areas. On the console’s portable screen, however, the 60FPS mode looks fine enough. Meanwhile, the 30FPS option offers a similarly stable experience, but with much sharper textures and better visual effects.</p>

 <p>But the best mode is probably the 40FPS option that takes advantage of the Switch 2’s 120hz screen. It will also work on a TV that supports 120hz in docked mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-and-village-are-damn-near-perfect-switch-2-ports-2000673230">40FPS has become a favorite of mine</a> this console generation as it offers up crisp visuals, yet provides a noticeably smoother gameplay experience, which is exactly what you’ll get in <em>Fallout 4.</em></p>

 <p>Regardless of what mode you pick, the fact that <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 even launched with all these options and they all mostly work is a huge improvement over <em>Skyrim’s</em> launch on the same console. That thing was a mess and was locked to 30FPS, though it has since been patched and dramatically improved.</p> <p>Many Switch 2 owners are hoping Bethesda does the same with <em>Fallout 4</em> and adds gyro controls and mouse support, something that this port is currently lacking. I don’t really care about those features, but it would be nice to see them added in the future. Still, this is a great port of <em>Fallout 4</em> that gives me hope for future Bethesda games on Switch 2. There is one area in which <em>Fallout 4</em> is worse than <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2, though. <em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles">Fallout 4</a></em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles"> takes up 61GB</a> of space compared to <em>Skyrim’s</em> 53GB install size. So be prepared to delete some stuff if you’re already struggling to find space on your Switch 2. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">Or buy a new memory card…if you can afford it right now.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming Showcase Will be Held May 28th To Help Games Get Funded]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-showcase-may-28th/</link>
            <guid>1446268</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming is proud to announce its debut virtual showcase.</p>



<p>Airing on <strong>May 28th at 3pm ET/12pm PT/8pm UK across Insider Gaming’s YouTube and social media platforms</strong>, the Insider Gaming Showcase comes to you with the goal of helping games get funded or find publisher backing.</p>



<p>But why? Well, to put it simply, the gaming industry is going through unprecedented times, and one of the hardest challenges that developers currently face is funding, and it’s only getting more difficult. That’s why we want to use our outlet and its exposure to help games get seen – <strong>completely free of charge</strong> to developers.</p>



<p>The showcase will feature nonstop, back-to-back game trailers, with no fluff in between to distract viewers from the awesome games currently in development. We’ll also feature a “concept” section in the showcase, featuring amazing concept art and ideas of games that haven’t yet reached a stage of development where footage can be shown.</p>



<p>Following the showcase, we will have separate deep-dive video interviews with the developers, in addition to written coverage on our website and in the app, so viewers can learn more about the games and the developers behind them.</p>



<p>In addition, Insider Gaming will also act as a PR agency to a loose degree. We will be working with other outlets and content creators before, during, and after the showcase to facilitate potential interviews to help get the games seen by as many different audiences as possible, again, free of charge.</p>



<p>To take things one step further, Insider Gaming will also compile all the games from the showcase into a dossier containing the contact information for each featured game, which we will send to our extensive list of investors, VC’s, and publishers after the show. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has high ambitions for the showcase, aiming to add at least 1 million cumulative new wishlists for the games we feature.</p>



<p>Moving past May 28th, we also want the showcase to be a recurring event, with a second showcase tentatively planned for December, with two shows a year moving forward.</p>



<p>Of course, we’re not ignorant of the fact that putting on a showcase costs time and money, and that’s why, behind the scenes, we’ve already partnered with a few companies to sponsor the show and are actively looking for a few more to help support this great initiative in times when developers need the exposure.</p>



<p>You can contact Tom Henderson at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f3879c9eb39a9d809a979681de94929e9a9d94dd909c9e" id="mailto:tom@insider-gaming.com">tom(a)insider-gaming.com</a> if you would like to sponsor the show. Developers can now submit their games by <strong>emailing Insider Gaming’s Executive Editor Mike Straw at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d0bdb9b3b8b1b5bc90b9bea3b9b4b5a2fdb7b1bdb9beb7feb3bfbd">michael(a)insider-gaming.com</a></strong> or <a href="https://forms.gle/3AVqXsLDohEA173K6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filling out our submission form</a>: </p>



<p><strong>Submissions are open until March 20.</strong></p>



<p>Outlets and content creators can contact either email address above to get involved as partners or for potential co-streaming opportunities.@</p>

These weapons can be unlocked and used even if you're in the middle of finishing the original campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>The Two Masters will introduce new stages, enemies, and trials along with the Abyssal Road, an endurance-based challenge mode. This challenge features 100 unique combat encounters from the base game and the DLC and introduces new enemy mechanics called Special Blood Essence and Frenzied.

The Two Masters will also add quality-of-life improvements, balancing adjustments, bug fixes to elements such as combat responsiveness, and new weapon set customization options.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XIVT6SvC18"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XIVT6SvC18" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Downloading The Two Masters will set you back $14.99 and is a free upgrade for owners of the Deluxe Edition.
