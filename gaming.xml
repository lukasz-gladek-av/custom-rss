			<p>It's no secret that Xbox has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-shipped-61-7-million-units-xbox-series-sold-28-3-ww-as-of-june-2024/">struggling lately</a>, even more so after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">Activision acquisition</a>, a deal that cost $69 billion to buy the company. This makes it the largest acquisition in gaming but not necessarily the smartest. It's been even more challenging for Xbox, as the overall gaming market has stagnated significantly, primarily due to events like the pandemic, which made the industry even more volatile than it already was. One of the significant factors in the industry now is how inaccessible games are to many people, with blockbuster games costing $70 to purchase as the average gamer. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Bond</a>, the Vice President of Xbox has said that they are now looking into other areas aside from the "traditional gaming business" and aiming to reach into "untapped areas." By discussing her next moves, she's hinted at new Xbox hardware, where Phil Spencer has continuously expressed interest in a handheld device.</p>
<p>Of course, while discussing new hardware, they are also peddling Xbox-exclusive games and promoting their subscriptions, such as the Xbox Game Pass, with a heavier focus now on the subscriptions instead of the consoles. While the Activision acquisition has much potential for Microsoft, Bond must continue to make more sacrifices in the game division. Over 2,650 jobs have been lost this year, adding to the total industry-wide job losses of 11,500.</p>
<p>Despite Microsoft's belief that the Activision acquisition will benefit them in the long run, the gaming unit is operating under a challenging set of revenue and profit goals, as those who are familiar with Xbox's business capabilities state.</p>
<p>Bond is very aware of the challenge ahead of them, saying, "The opportunity on the other side is way bigger for all of us," an opportunity that the company has been fighting for almost a year. A few months after Bond started working at Microsoft, Game Pass was implemented, a subscription service that Microsoft spends $1 billion on yearly to get third-party games.</p>
<p>It's not a secret that most of Microsoft's profits come from the company's other sectors, which have nothing to do with gaming. While the higher-ups who work in these sectors don't know much about gaming, Spencer said, "You could see the board grasp how Xbox could be so much bigger than it is today."</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, Game Pass subscribers spend 50% more on games than non-subscribers, and a large part of the credit goes to Sarah Bond for making the subscription service viable. To this date, Bond still recognizes that she's "making decisions that we're going to live with in the next decade" in an industry that is incredibly volatile and constantly changing.</p>
<p>Although many believe that Xbox won't see another console released, Bond has said that a new console will feature "the largest technical leap you will have ever seen." Whether this will include a handheld console remains to be seen.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025.988059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a> is condensing its release schedule for post-launch updates. Instead of free and paid content arriving into 2025, it will all - three free updates, and two paid DLCs - arrive together in a "one major update" in November.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following the release of update 1.2, we made the decision to combine all remaining paid DLC and free content drops in the roadmap into one unified delivery in November. Combining the content into one beat will allow us to focus all our resources and provide you all with a higher-quality experience," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1840080/view/4708039771670613783">the announcement of the roadmap change</a>.
</p><p>
Here's an image which breaks down the new roadmap:

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/homeworld-3-roadmap.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Homeworld 3's post-launch content roadmap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"With the changes we’re making, we want to assure those of you who purchased the Year One Pass that you will be getting everything we’ve previously promised. Additionally, we've made modifications to our plans to include elements requested by the community," according to the announcement.
</p>
<p>The Year One Pass granted access to three paid DLCs which would expand the co-op War Games mode with new playable factions and artifacts. That's the Kalan Raiders pack, which released in July, and the Somtaaw and Taiidan fleet packs that are now dropping in November. 
</p>
<p>Getting access to some of these updates early is presumably a good thing on its own, but hit the comments on the announcement post and you'll find plenty of players disappointed the Somtaaaw fleet pack only includes two new ships, and concerns that this means the game won't receive further updates past the end of the year.
</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">Homeworld 3 review</a>, Nic found the game sometimes too faithful to its predecessors, but also dinged it for "favouring reaction speed over tactical depth." The November update will include free changes based on community feedback, some of which might help address that particular problem, including the ability for players to decide themselves when they're ready to move onto the next mission, a more linear tech tree, and a reduction in available resources so as to make decisions about what ships to build matter more.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>' fourth season approaches. It'll kick off on September 26th, with a new map, a new tutorial and the restoration of Cashout as the core ranked mode. There's a new trailer below, which is worth watching even if you don't play The Finals, says I.

<p>The Finals just has the best trailers in video games right now. I'm sure I've written about this before, but just look at this thing. Almost all of it in-game, showing things you can actually do; the graphic design and way the logos and adverts are intercut or overlayed into the game world; the sound design, like the announcer yelling "Showtime!" being stretched out and overwhelmed by the sounds of action. It's a treat just to watch.
</p>
<p>The action above is taking place within Fortune Stadium, the new map being added for season four, which has three distinct areas based upon the (fictional) corporate sponsors for this season. Naturally, it's fully destructible, as all The Finals' maps are. 
</p>
<p>Season three of The Finals introduced a new mode, Terminal Attack, and made it the game's ranked mode. Apparently it didn't go so well. "We know the switch to Terminal Attack as ranked mode was a misstep. But with missteps come learnings, and while we believe in TA and saw many of you playing and enjoying it, it's just not quite the right fit for our Ranked Play or the core of The Finals," according to the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s4teaser">official season four announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>The Finals also introduced the World Tour - designed to be more playful, less competitive than the Ranked matches can be otherwise, while still offering progression - and it continues in season four. The update should also bring a new tutorial, a new battle pass, and the usual tranche of new cosmetics when it launches next week. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/munchkin-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Comic-style art appears across video games and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. In the 1980s, my childhood was filled with several of these stylized games that integrated comic characters into their gameplay. While Steve Jackson’s cartoonish dungeon crawler Munchkin wasn’t around back then, it is certainly a game I find myself returning to for nostalgia and silliness here and there.</p><p>Munchkin is a cartoon foray into a dungeon featuring a cast of characters from fantasy and reality. The card game is filled with comical art and often witty banter that will have you laughing and probably rolling your eyes at some of the dad jokes. </p><h3>Munchkin Gameplay</h3><p>Gameplay for Munchkin is fairly quick and simple. You start as an ordinary human with a few cards in your initial arsenal of goodies. The cards in your hand, along with others you'll pick up as you play, help you navigate 10 floors of a dungeon by giving you attributes of a specific class and arming you to fight the monsters you'll encounter. You'll employ various zany antics and characteristics against formidable foes as you compete against other players, kicking in doors to fight monsters and gaining loot to increase your power throughout the dungeon run. Which player will reign victoriously in the end? The journey is yours to discover in Munchkin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in This Article">Featured in This Article</h2></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Munchkin (Core Game)</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 2 - Unnatural Axe</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 3 - Clerical Errors</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 4 - The Need For Steed</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 5 - DeRanged</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 6 - Double Dungeons</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Cthulhu</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Super Munchkin</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Steampunk</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Zombies</h3></p></div></div><p>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to battle your way through the dungeon and get to level 10 before your counterparts.

You can play against friends who also have a copy of the game or against the AI. Games outside of the tutorial can be played with 3-6 players. A single player can choose to go against two or more AI or combinations of AI and human players on the same machine or online.</p><p>One of the key differences between the digital version and the physical version is that you can choose to play without gender-connected items. In the original versions, gendered items (only two different ones in these games, which do not acknowledge the gender spectrum) are a big part of the game.</p><p>Currently, the Steam version is the only way to play Munchkin digitally. There was talk about it being a mod on Tabletop Simulator, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/286160/discussions/0/371919771744101715/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comments</a> on the Steam community regarding things allude to potential licensing issues. A 2014 <a href="https://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=128984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum post</a> on the Steve Jackson Game website also noted, “Our policy has been consistent and clear: people who want to create digital versions of our games must obtain a license to do so. I'm sorry that you feel this is disrespectful to our fans and customers. We feel exactly as disrespected by people who use our content without our permission.” </p><p>That said, I found the digital version to be worth playing. It also has an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392090/Munchkin_Digital__Unnatural_Axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expansion called Unnatural Axe</a> for an additional $4.99, which requires the base game.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Munchkin offers some cartoonish art often paired with witty and zany adversaries. In several ways, I’ve found myself enjoying the game. I know several friends who enjoy it for the most part as well. However, as I’ve aged and the years have passed, I’ve found that the game misses the mark in some ways, particularly at the expense of others where it shouldn’t. This seems also to be the case for others on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a>, as the current rating is only 5.9.</p><p>Gendered items and character designs can take away the enjoyment of some players. I liked how the digital version allowed me to step away from that a bit if I wanted. I wish other physical game versions did. The zany objects and fantastically witty text could be much better with more inclusivity.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a> is a self-described "extremely normal gardening game", in which you tend to a garden, explore different realities, and try not to die. We've been excited to get our hands on its shears for a while, thanks in part to an excellent demo, and in part due to it being from Sokpop Collective member and Bernband developer Tom van den Boogaart.
</p>
<p>Now it has a release date: October 4th.

<p>"I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deeply-unusual-gardening-game-grunns-shear-snip-deserves-every-award-geoff-keighley-has-ever-invented">wrote Nic about the Grunn demo</a>. "Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears."
</p>
<p>If you've never played it, Bernband remains a delight. It's a first-person game about exploring a strange, alien city, with no goal other than tourism, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-being-pleasantly-lost-bernband">we celebrated back in 2014</a>. Alice O, best of us all, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-city-game">particularly taken with it</a>.
</p>
<p>Grunn looks to have a bit of that same energy in its village, full of odd, quiet folk living their lives. The Grunn demo remains playable from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720950/Grunn/">its Steam page</a>, too. Roll on October 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>What does a name like Metaphor: ReFantazio conjure in your mind? I picture something along the lines of Disney oddities—old-school cartoons and aesthetics. But knowing it comes from developer ATLUS, and it’s the first original world from the studio since Persona, I’m willing to look past any potential strangeness for its inevitable greatness. Here is everything we know about Metaphor: ReFantazio!</p>







<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio thrusts players into the world of the United Kingdom of Euchronia, a parallel fantasy realm that mirrors the physical, modern world. The kingdom is in distress following the King’s assassination, and now a young hero must set forth on an epic journey to stabilize the land and uncover its mysteries.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Image via ATLUS</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can play Metaphor: ReFantazio on <strong>October 11</strong> on:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Xbox Series X|S</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>No, Metaphor: ReFantazio is an entirely separate experience in a completely new and unique world that is not connected to the Persona franchise besides being from the same studio. It’s the first new universe crafted by developer ATLUS since its inception, as the team primarily focuses on the Persona series.</p>







<p>According to the game’s director, it will take approximately the same time to complete Metaphor: ReFantazio as it does to finish Persona 5. Now, that’s massive. If you want to finish Persona 5, it can take over 175 hours to finish all of the game’s content, including all story and side content.</p>



<p>The studio wanted to include less content for a more streamlined experience, but it ballooned with various elements and mechanics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ronaldo-fatal-fury-collaboration/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the last few weeks, Cristiano Ronaldo, the instantly recognisable soccer player, has been taking the content creation world by storm. In July, he kickstarted a YouTube channel, and just two months later, the electrifying sports personality has gained more than 62 million subscribers.</p>



<p> Now, the athlete who many consider to be the GOAT has teased a collaboration of sorts with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cr7-appears">CR7 Appears</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Cristiano Ronaldo teased a short clip showcasing soccer stadiums and flashes of the Fatal Fury branding, along with the tagline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A legendary player joins a legendary game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is an upcoming fighting game that’s being pieced together by SNK, a Japanese developer with almost fifty years in the business. It’s set to be released in 2025, and from the teaser we’ve seen today, it looks like Ronaldo will have a starring spot in the game’s line-up – but that’s just conjecture at this point.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This wouldn’t be Ronaldo’s first brush with the gaming world. He’s a prolific backer of UFL, a free-to-play soccer game being released by Strikerz. It has been penned as a competitor to the likes of EA Sports FC and eFootball, and it has had the backing of Ronaldo for several months. </p>



<p>Furthermore, Ronaldo was visibly attached to the Esports World Cup, which made sense given his local connection with Al Nassr, a Saudi soccer club. He attended some of the more ostentatious events under the Esports World Cup banner, expressing his support for the industry.</p>



<p>Do you want to see Ronaldo feature as a potential fighter in Fatal Fury? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p>There’s some confusion surrounding New World, with Amazon Games announcing the upcoming Aeternum for October. Most people are unclear whether this is a brand-new game, an expansion, or a total revamp of the MMORPG. We’re hoping to clear up the matter for you by going over everything we know about New World: Aeternum.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-new-world-aeternum">What is New World: Aeternum?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>New World: Aeternum is a massive overhaul of the MMORPG New World by developer Amazon Games. It features a revamped storyline,  improved dialogue and cinematics, a large-scale PvP zone, additional raid content, solo trials, and a slew of bug fixes and technical improvements under the hood. </p>



<p>For everyone on the fence about New World, Aeternum is a total revamp that overhauls the core experience and gameplay, ensuring a more streamlined, fluid, and fun experience. It seems like a good time to hop into the MMO!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-new-world-aeternum-release">When Does New World: Aeternum Release?</h2>



<p>New World: Aeternum launches on October 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you own a copy of New World and Rise of the Angry Earth on PC, you will receive the update utterly free that day. There’s no need to buy an additional copy of the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-a-new-game">Is New World: Aeternum a New Game?</h2>



<p>New World: Aeternum is not an entirely new game but more of a content update/revamp for the original New World that enhances the experience and provides access to all available content for those who buy the relaunch. Furthermore, for the first time, New World will be released on consoles—PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-free-to-play">Is New World: Aeternum Free to Play?</h2>



<p>No, New World: Aeternum is not a free-to-play game. It will cost money to buy the title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. However, if you own New World and its expansion, Rise of the Angry Earth, on PC, you’ll receive the overhaul completely free on launch day. You must buy a copy if you don’t own the game. If you don’t own the expansion, you must buy it before unlocking access to all available content in Aeternum.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-multiplayer">Is New World: Aeternum Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While this is a total revamp of the core MMORPG experience, multiplayer does remain at the heart of the game. New World: Aeternum will offer solo play, small group content, and large-scale PvP content for end-game players who want.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-new-world-aeternum-have-cross-progression">Does New World: Aeternum Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, no. New World: Aeternum does not offer cross-progression, so if you wish to play the game on both PC and PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, you must purchase individual copies on one or more platforms and start new characters on both servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-aeternum-cross-platform">Is New World: Aeternum Cross-Platform?</h2>



<p>Yes! New World: Aeternum does offer cross-platform play between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on day one when the game launches on October 15. However, it’s unclear whether all servers will be cross-platform or if there will be specific servers for the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-difference-with-new-world-aeternum">What is the Difference With New World: Aeternum?</h2>



<p>New World: Aternum features many performance and quality-of-life improvements, additional content, and access to all available content for new players and those who purchase a copy of the game, such as on one of the consoles. This new content includes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>10-Player Raid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pvp Zone</strong></li>



<li><strong>Endgame Soul Trials</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gear Score Increase to 725</strong></li>



<li><strong>Matchmaking</strong></li>



<li><strong>Crossworld Arenas</strong></li>



<li><strong>Upleveled Cutlass Keys Zone (Quests, Enemies, Etc.)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Performance and QOL Improvements</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cinematic Storytelling</strong></li>



<li><strong>Cross-Platform Play</strong></li>



<li><strong>Player Archetypes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fresh Start Worlds</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller Support</strong></li>



<li><strong>DX12 Rendering</strong></li>



<li><strong>Combat Improvements</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-is-new-world-worth-playing">Is New World Worth Playing?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Amazon Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’re going to receive a mixed response whenever you ask this question. Some people genuinely enjoy the game, and I was one of those people for a long time. However, I quickly grew weary of the many issues plaguing the experience, especially the poor server performance, which forced me to look for other MMORPGs to play.</p>



<p>That said, while playing the game, I did enjoy my time. It offers one of the genre’s best crafting and gathering mechanics, and the combat is rather entertaining. I’m curious to see what improvements they’ve made for Aeternum. If you own the game and its expansion, there’s no reason not to download Aeternum in October to check out what’s new!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rayman-is-becoming-a-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Rayman’s limbless brand of anarchic puzzle-platforming has been delighting fans since 1995, with five main video games and a number of spin-offs, across multiple systems. But one play Rayman has yet to save from the forces of evil is your tabletop. Now that’s about to change thanks to the upcoming Rayman: The Board Game (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyosgames/rayman-the-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see it on Kickstarter</a>), a collaboration between Ubisoft and Flyos games on the one hand, and three designers on the other: Maxime Tardif, creator of critically acclaimed, best-selling title <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVXr0?object_uuid=abfb8b87-8ac3-4671-a1a4-001b62c5c84e&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Earth</a>, one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games"><u>best strategy board games</u></a>, alongside Gary Paitre and Thomas Filippi of Flyos. </p><p>What unites the trio is a love for the source material. “We really wanted to see our favorite eggplant hero back in action,” laughs Filippi. “The games are all about having fun, a bit of chaos, and some friendly competition, and we felt that vibe would be perfect for a board game setting.” The resulting board game has been designed to be playable by all ages, and includes solo and cooperative modes and different difficult levels alongside the head-to-head competition you’d expect.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-2-1726846976417.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Having a family-friendly vibe was important to the developers, not least because they have children of their own. “When I play with my young daughters, I usually stick to with the rookie and intermediate modes,” Filippi reveals. “But when I face team members, we can play more aggressively.” He also feels that it’s one way in which the game channels the essence of its source material. “Rayman is a positive character, always smiling, making him perfect for younger players,” he continues. “The humor, the smooth action, and those imaginative worlds, all of it adds up to something special.”</p><p>With so many different video games to draw on, the team decided to blend the two most contemporary titles to form the basis for their game, but one of them took the fore. “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review"><u>Rayman Legends</u></a> felt like a natural fit as it’s the most recent game in the series,” explains co-designer Gary Paitre. “And honestly, we wanted to include Barbara! She’s got such a cool vibe. The musical levels, in which you run in rhythm while making quick and sharp decisions, was also a big source of inspiration. However, some elements from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/11/10/rayman-origins-review"><u>Rayman Origins</u></a> are also included, such as missiles.” These zip around the board, providing dangerous dynamic hazards that the players must avoid.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rayman Legends felt like a natural fit as it’s the most recent game in the series</p></div><p>Besides Rayman himself, the two other characters featured in the game are Globox and Murfy. Each has a miniature figure to use on the board, but in the basic game they’re mechanically the same, each having an identical deck of action cards that lets them run, jump and glide around the board, slapping enemies, and avoiding obstacles, just like in the computer games. Keeping all the basic decks the same was a deliberate design choice. “In the video game, each hero has the same set of actions,” Paitre points out. “What makes your adventure unique is how you choose to apply those actions.”</p><p>As players gain confidence, however, they can make their chosen character more unique by including special ability cards keyed to each personality. “It’s a little light asymmetry, to add some variety,” says Filippi. Paitre fills in the details. “They let you choose which actions you prefer,” he explains. “You can have more initiative, or focus on slapping. They help make every game different, and we’ve tried to ensure that no hero is stronger than another.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-7-1726846976419.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>With all the attention paid to tying in the board game to its source material, fans might be surprised to discover that Rayman The Board Game is a race game. This seems rather different from the standard platforming levels in Rayman Legends, but there’s a good reason. “It’s inspired by the time-trial runs from the video games,” says Filippi. “We wanted that same feeling of intensity and quick thinking in the board game. It’s not just about getting from point A to B fast; it’s about making smart moves, keeping an eye on what everyone else is doing, and maybe throwing a wrench in their plans. We wanted each playthrough to have that unpredictable, ‘anything can happen’ feel that makes Rayman games so fun.” There are still Teensies, Rayman’s magical friends, to save along the way, and you’ll need to have rescued three of them to take the win.</p><p>During each turn, players secretly select a pair of action cards for that round, which are added together to give a total value of in-game moves like jumping and slapping. These tie into the features on the racetrack, so you’ll need to jump to gain access to platforms, slap enemies in your path and glide over gaps and there are multiple paths around each board that you’ll need to assess strategically to gain an edge. The cards you chose are discarded and, to get them back, you need to take a “bubble” action, skipping a turn and falling behind in the race in exchange for temporary immunity and the chance to pick up and re-use your discards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fans might be surprised to discover that Rayman The Board Game is a race game.</p></div><p>Getting this right is a surprisingly cerebral and challenging task: almost every card selection will see you wasting actions or falling short in some way of what you actually want to do. The tactics are in optimizing your available cards to the track before you. Doing so can cause players a bit of analysis paralysis as they work through the options, which gives the game plenty of depth but isn’t necessarily a close fit for the frenetic pace of parts of the original video games, something that’s true of a lot of video-to-board game adaptations.</p><p>Filippi acknowledges that this was a challenge for the team. “We wanted to keep that feeling of intensity but also add some depth that you can only get in a tabletop setting,” he says. But he feels they got the balance right. “You still have those moments of quick action, but mixed with the need to think ahead, which is just like navigating a tricky platform level. You have to plan your moves, and figure out when to go all out or when to hold back.” And he thinks there’s a payoff for introducing more analytical elements, too. “It offers that same sense of accomplishment when you pull off a great move or outsmart your friends.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-4-1726846976418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Bringing in third designer Maxime Tardiff to work on the game was, in part, an attempt to meet that challenge. “At first, Gary and I wanted to make that game ourselves," Filippi continues. “But we decided to bring an experienced designer to the table. He was a perfect match, passionate, smart and accessible. His input was crucial for refining the action decks, the level structures and the solo and cooperative mode. He pushed us to elevate and balance the gameplay even further, like integrating the asymmetric elements.”</p><p>Flyos have worked on a race game before, 2017’s <a href="https://www.kiwetin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwetin</a> in which the players chase each other through a fantasy forest. It has similarities to Rayman: The Board Game, with players collecting action tiles to speed them on their way, but they’re largely superficial. Movement in Kiwetin is dice-based, for example, whereas in Rayman it’s totally down to the player’s decisions. Nevertheless, they learned a lot of lessons from developing and producing it that they were able to apply to their latest project. “It was our first crack at both board games and crowdfunding, and it taught us a lot about balance and keeping things replayable,” Patire explains”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/rayman-prototype-hor-6-1726846976418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>There were, however, lots of other board games the team did draw on in their quest to bring Rayman to the tabletop. One was popular, family-friend car-racing game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heat-pedal-to-the-metal-board-game-review"><u>Heat</u></a>. “It gave us a great feel for how to make a fast-paced racing game exciting with its immediate reveal phase,” Paitre explains. Their other major influence was a little more unexpected: dungeon-crawling campaign behemoth <a href="https://zdcs.link/RVgAV?object_uuid=abfb8b87-8ac3-4671-a1a4-001b62c5c84e&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a>. “That helped us think about depth in cooperative gameplay,” he continues. “Playing two cards at once from your hand and improvising a new plan last second is a feature, not a bug,” he laughs. “But we didn’t just copy those games, it’s about mixing the best elements of what we love to create something that feels like Rayman.”</p><p>While the game is currently in a fully playable state, Filippi admits that, like a lot of crowd-funded games, there’s still a bit of work to do to fully realize its potential. “The balancing isn’t fully finalized yet but, so far, the winning player is never too far ahead of the last, which keeps the excitement high until the end,” he says. Talking to them both, it’s a delight to see how committed they are to the source material, and how proud they are of the opportunity to bring it to the table. “Seeing it come to life is truly a dream come true,” Filippi beams. Rayman fans all over the world will soon be able to judge for themselves how well that dream has been translated into reality.</p><p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flyosgames/rayman-the-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>You can find out more about Rayman The Board Game, and back it, on Kickstarter.</em></u></a></p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

<p>Interestingly, several reviewers say they've been able to play the game <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084783543/recommended/2322010/">without</a> linking a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198309809471/recommended/2322010/">PSN account</a> at all.</p>
<p>Others are unhappy that even creating a PSN account in a country where the service is available <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/brian22/recommended/2322010/">requires</a> "submitting a mobile phone number to verify your age [...] or submit a photograph of your face or a government-issued ID to a third party site".</p>

<p>"But I don't even understand because I could play fine without logging in. It sucks because those reviews are gonna turn people away from an incredible game."</p>

The game is most often presented in the former, where screen transitions are accompanied by the turning of a page, and the middle of most stages appropriately folds where they meet. The eponymous hero goes on many adventures with his friends Violet and Thrash, who each embody noble and righteous virtues, while triumphantly defeating the forces of evil time and time again. At the close of these journeys, the Plucky Squire comes home and writes about it all, because naturally he’s <em>also</em> a bestselling author in the land of Mojo. It’s a game with all the fixings of a kids’ classic, something that can be shared with the children in one’s life to encourage them to dream big and boldly. As I played the game, though, I did find myself wishing that <em>The Plucky Squire </em>actually believed in its audience as much as it claims to. - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-recommend-id="image://c99e848421f125896bf44e4733897111" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The 30th Anniversary PlayStation collection sits on display." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sony is marking the 30th anniversary of PlayStation with a new lineup of limited-edition, PS1-inspired consoles and accessories and they look surprisingly good, especially for those of us who still have fond memories of listening to the disc spin in the original console while grinding through our favorite ‘90s RPG late at night.  - Ethan Gach <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-collection-preorder-price-1851652528">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Saber Interactive / Focus Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-recommend-id="image://51ab161e6d9d7368dbfa1f383d47de59" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Space Marine kills aliens " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>,</a></span> made by Saber Interactive, is the sequel to a beloved 2011 shooter and has been praised for, among other things, feeling like an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games-like-space-marine-2-warhammer-boltgun-gears-l4d2-1851650812">old-school Xbox 360-era game</a></span>.

I came away from my seven hours with it really impressed with what feels like the most cohesive game BioWare has put together since probably 2012’s <em>Mass Effect 3</em>.
