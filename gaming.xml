            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has released the first&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and we're a long way from the careful, considered CRPG approach of 2009's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>.</p>
<p>Last week, BioWare revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Dreadwolf&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-dreadwolf-the-veilguard">had become&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em></a>, and that we'd get a first look at gameplay soon. That time has come, and first impressions of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>are...certainly different.</p>
<p>The trailer opens with the player character, here named Rook, and series regular Varric Tethras looking for a mage detective (that's a detective who's a mage, not one who finds mages) named Neve Gallus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=HQ1OCbZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-hack-and-slash.jpg?itok=WA2K4rUo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>isn't the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>you might remember.</figcaption></figure><p>Varric and Rook move through a city seemingly watched over by a giant Panopticon-style tower, and it isn't long before demons are running loose throughout the city, apparently summoned by Solas himself, the Dreadwolf of the game's previous title.</p>
<p>Soon, Rook, Varric, and companion Harding get into some combat, and we see that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is pretty much shrugging off the cloak of tactical RPG combat to fully embrace action.</p>
<p>The combat looks very hack-and-slash-inspired; the focus seems to be on stylish moves and cooldowns rather than strategy and planning, which means the trajectory of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inquisition&nbsp;</em>is arguably at its apex here.</p>
<p><em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>also looks like it's putting quite a heavy emphasis on setpieces and "cool moments"; bringing down a statue and watching as demons rampage through the city streets spring to mind in this trailer.</p>

<p>Although the combat doesn't look much like old-school&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, we do get to see our protagonist making some dialogue decisions on an&nbsp;<em>Inquisition</em>-style dialogue wheel that assigns responses to certain tones and moods.</p>
<p>We also get to see decisions being made that will apparently impact the plot and how characters feel about us; at one stage, Rook makes a decision of which one character approves and another disapproves.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that this gameplay trailer represents the opening moments of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which means that it might be placing a heavier emphasis on setpieces than later sequences do in order to set the scene.</p>
<p>The trailer culminates in Varric confronting Solas about his deeds, upon which Solas shatters Varric's iconic crossbow Bianca and two powerful-looking demons appear to flank him.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see just how much of the original&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s DNA has actually made it into&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but either way, the game is launching on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S this fall. You can check out our hands-off preview of BioWare's latest RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">right here</a>.</p>

You wait years for a new season of your favourite show, and then find out it's ending. In what looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">classic Netflix fashion</a>, today's action-packed trailer for Arcane season two describes the show's long-awaited second run of episodes as "The Final Chapter". 
</p>
<p>
Which, for possibly the best video game adaptation of all time, and just an incredible TV show in general, is pretty bad news. 
</p>
<p>
Spoilers abound for the show's first season here, as the trailer appears to answer what happened next after the first season's explosive cliffhanger ending. 
</p>

<p>
Some (but clearly not all) of the series' characters from season one are present, in this, our best look at Arcane season two yet. It looks great! But hell, to find out these episodes are likely the end of Arcane's story already is a massive shame. 
</p>
<p>
Arcane's first nine-episode season debuted on Netflix in 2021. It took six years to make, and was showered by praise from fans of its League of Legends source material and newcomers alike. It was also critically adored, and won that year's Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program.
</p>
<p>
The show's upcoming second season has taken another three years to put together, and it was hoped its story would continue on further. There's still the possibility of another Arcane-style series set elsewhere within its universe, perhaps, but fans should now seemingly prepare themselves for the show's overall series finale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">when new episodes arrive this November</a>.

See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="I0DbbW">As if predestined by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24090250/bene-gesserit-sex-powers-frank-herbert-books-vs-movies">Bene Gesserit</a>, <a href="https://www.cmon.com/products/dune-war-for-arrakis/"><em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em></a> arrived at the perfect moment. This big-box strategy game emerged in the wake of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two"><em>Dune: Part Two</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072878/dune-2-timothee-chalamet-paul-hero-denis-villeneuve-interview">Dennis Villeneuve</a>’s follow-up film that portrays the second half of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24075067/dune-star-wars-frank-herbert-george-lucas">Frank Herbert</a>’s seminal novel. Just like the motion picture, this <a href="https://www.polygon.com/board-games">board game</a> depicts the escalating desert war between the deposed House Atreides and usurping House Harkonnen. Both film and game share a second quality in common — they are spectacular pieces of media that could aptly be described as works of art.</p>

<p id="bIc12B">The duo responsible for <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> are <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22249192/tolkien-rpg-the-one-ring-second-edition-free-league-release-date-kickstarter">Marco Magi and Francesco Nepitello</a>. The bones of the game bear the shape of this team’s previous release, a board game titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Games-Multi-Colored-AGS-WOTR001-Players/dp/1903385113?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23938020__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>War of the Ring</em></a>, depicting the storied struggle at the heart of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It’s an epic experience that features clashing armies <em>and </em>the march to Mt. Doom <em>and</em> all of the most important characters in Tolkien’s novels. <em>War of the Ring</em>’s best aspect is the tactical dice system that controls the flow of play and composes the game loop. This is the main element carried ported over into <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>.</p>
<p id="vUsPmS">Each turn both players roll a pool of dice. These custom six-siders have various action icons and the results determine what you will be able to do during the round. Play then consists of going back and forth from Atreides to Harkonnen, each player assigning a die and executing an action. </p>
<p id="e4YUu5">This is a simple system. You spend a die to recruit troops or move them. You can also play special cards from your hand to spring nasty surprises or launch massive attacks. The dice pool acts as a restriction, forcing players into tough spots where you can’t perfectly execute a plan. The tactical challenge is in how you utilize your options to warp the board to your will.</p>

<p id="acyUYN">Victory, likewise, is nuanced. The Atreides have the tougher assignment as they need to focus on a small assortment of goals dealt out from the Prescience deck each turn. These encourage various maneuvers built broadly on the novel’s narrative, such as Paul drinking the Water of Life or Atreides using their Fremen warriors to attack vulnerable harvesters. They focus play on momentary considerations, forcing adaptation and bending to the environment — two central themes running throughout Herbert’s novel. </p>
<p id="0ya1rT">There is also incentive to control the ecological stations scattered about the map. These form hotspots as the Harkonnen player will typically try to defend them. Finally, Atreides will edge closer to success by taking the Harkonnen strongholds, such as the North Pole and Arrakeen. These are always well defended and a significant challenge, but with tools such as the fierce sandworms and the elite Fedaykin troops, such an offensive is possible.</p>
<p id="ID6Isy">The Harkonnen player has it a bit easier. Instead of pursuing dynamic objectives that change each round, they simply need to destroy 10 points of Fremen bases. The value of each sietch is hidden, but this number can be scouted with ornithopters as well as some clever card play. This is the more blunt faction, relying on marshaling legions of troops to root out the indigenous Fremen and annihilate them. It highlights the alternative philosophies of each house and incorporates one of the novel’s many motifs.</p>

<p id="ffBFQL">Both combat and the incorporation of named leaders on the battlefield are reminiscent of <em>War of the Ring</em>. Violence is simple: Each unit adds a die that yields either a hit, shield, or special leader buffs. Shields cancel out hits with the remainder applied as casualties to the army. The special leader buffs are the most intriguing aspect. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23930166/lego-dune-set-buy-order">Baron Harkonnen</a>, for instance, will offer defense while The Beast Rabban supplies extra blows. The special troops — Fedaykin and Sardaukar — add further texture by soaking multiple hits and negating the opponent’s defense results. This, while simple and easy to internalize, proves a surprisingly strong offensive toolset that results in the potential for devastating results. Fights resolve quickly and logically, framing dramatic moments that punctuate play and support the larger narrative arc of the game.</p>
<p id="vb9M65">Besides conflict, the leaders are a significant aspect due to how they enhance player actions. Paul allows you to perform a special action that rallies multiple legions to him. Rabban can execute a potent double move which allows you to strike behind enemy lines and gain separation. Still other leaders influence card acquisition or deploy special units to the board. As the narrative evolves, new leaders come into play. The result is an unique story path each playthrough, with some sessions never even witnessing the Reverend Mother or the great Wild Maker.</p>

<p id="etH8DU">There is a lot of detail here. The asymmetry of the two forces is a large part of the appeal. The Atreides/Fremen forces can ride worms across the desert with impunity, while Harkonnen legions left in the open desert are worn down by storms each round. Collecting spice is integral to the Harkonnen keeping the rest of the empire content and maintaining their economic advantage. There is bluffing and secrecy through hidden units and vicious card play. Despite all of this detail and the large amount of content, the game wraps up in a surprising two hours. It’s shocking how this framework is exceedingly capable of furnishing a full story arc with depth and precision in the alloted time.</p>
<p id="1CrEm0">Many of its accomplishments are a result of the design team iterating on <em>War of the Ring</em>, now in its second edition. Tweaks to leaders represent a significant improvement over that game, as they are now decoupled from the bonus dice they grant in Middle-earth. Here on Arrakis, the action system is more satisfying, as Atreides possess less dice but are able to perform the clever wormsign action on their turn — effectively manipulating the environment — instead of simply passing and waiting for their opponent to spend their extra dice. The time commitment is much shorter, as <em>War of the Ring</em> requires a huge chunk of the day to setup and play. There are other small improvements found in battle, the card system, and general game flow. The outcome is an experience that sits at this splendid intersection of grand strategy wargame with a more personal and intimate composition.</p>
<p id="BhDQfB">Despite these plaudits, it’s important to understand this is primarily a two-player game. It can function as a four-player endeavor with each faction split in half between a pair of players, but this is far less satisfying in practice and undercuts some of the design’s strengths. If a group of four players is in search of something to play, they would be much better off looking elsewhere.</p>

<p id="nYh1Xf">Of more significance is an issue of faction balance. Michele Garbuggio, a developer that worked in support of the design team on this game, has <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3304026/article/44306943#44306943">stated</a> that “by precise design intent, [<em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em>] is not balanced on a 50/50 win ratio…it’s more like a 60/40…in favor of the Harkonnen.” The intentionality behind this reflects the power disparity between the forces and the miraculous rise of the Kwisatz Haderach to lead the scattered Fremen. This does not detract from the overall power of the design. The vast majority of participants will engage this game casually and not in a tournament format, and in this more relaxed environment it’s of little consequence.</p>
<p id="Tzrjtg">Regardless of these minor concerns, <em>Dune: War for Arrakis</em> has burst from the sand with ferocity. This game offers an epic experience flush with drama and moments of grandeur. It successfully condenses and refines many of the concepts of its designer’s previous work, and it produces a special game that stands with its own identity. 2024 is only halfway complete, but it may have already received its best title. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-spider-man-2-will-receive-8-new-suits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Insomniac has just unveiled a brand new free content update for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that brings new suits into the pictures. 8 new suits will be introduced, some of them are based on new designs whereas others are returning favourites from the previous instalments of the franchise. The update will be released on June 18, 2024, and with the suits, we can also expect the developers to add some stability improvements to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four new suits have arrived through a collaboration with American artist and fashion designer, Colm Dillane or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kidsuper/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KidSuper</a>. The first one is from the designer himself called the Metro Suit, which has a puffer design inspired by his collection along with an exclusive and original colourway. Now Spidey can be dripped out while saving the civilians of New York.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The second suit has been co-designed by Brazilian Footballer, Vini Jr. His suit is called the Ginga Suit and it showcases the footballer’s love for his country. The suit features the colours and accents from the Brazilian flag along with a sportier look for Miles Morales. With the Ginga Suit Spider-Man looks ready to win another Champions League trophy.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The third suit has been co-designed by British-Belgium motorsport racer, Lando Norris and his design is called the Fluro suit. The main inspiration behind his design “is the feeling of speed” and he also wished to give a touch of racing to the suit, which is why the mask looks like a helmet. All that remains is an F1 car to rule the streets of Manhattan&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The fourth suit has been co-designed by Japanese singer, actress and model Rina Sawayama. The Motorchic Suit adds a leather jacket and trousers to Spider-Man, with metal detailing. It brings out the inner motorbike rider in Spidey.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In terms of the returning favourites, the one that fans won’t miss is Peter Parker’s Spider-Man suit from Into the Spider-Verse movie. Next up we have Peter Parker’s Last Stand suit. In third, we receive a slightly animated version of the Miles Morales suit. Last but not least is The Uptown Pride suit from Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new suits will arrive with updated version 1.003.000 along with some stability fixes. Additionally, the developers have addressed some player feedback too and will now introduce the “ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa”.&nbsp;Additionally, you can check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-great-web-trailer-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-the-great-web-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second</a> trailers for the cancelled multiplayer Spider-Man game, Spider-Man: The Great Web. </p>

<p>Summer Game Fest, E3, or whatever we’re calling it now, is finally over. Xbox had arguably one of the best showcases in the past decade, whereas Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest main show fell short of some of the more significant announcements we would have expected from such a show. The Ubisoft Forward showcase also felt underwhelming, especially considering the slate of games we know that Ubisoft has in development and is set to release in the next couple of years. So, what was up with that disappointing Ubisoft Forward showcase?</p>



<p>Two of Ubisoft’s biggest games to release later this year, Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, took up over half of the one-hour show, and apart from the two surprise announcements of Anno 117 and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2026 date for Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, there wasn’t that much else to brag about. </p>



<p>The most notable misses of games that have already been announced were the Splinter Cell Remake, Project U, Beyond Good and Evil 2, the 20th-anniversary edition of the original, and even a showing of the Assassin’s Creed Infinity Hub, which is set to launch alongside Shadows. Division 3 has also been officially announced but will not enter production until later this year after appointed management is free after the release of Outlaws.</p>



<p>Other games expected to be released in the next two to three years include Assassin’s Creed Invictus, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Hexe</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Far Cry 7</a>, a Far Cry extraction shooter, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-recon-project-over-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Ghost Recon game</a>, several new free-to-play games, and a new WW2 extraction shooter under the codename Crest that has an ambitious 10-year live service plan that will follow the events of World War 2. </p>



<p>If everything comes to fruition, it’s easy to see that Ubisoft does have a great pipeline of games in the works, but the reality of game development is incredibly complex. Speaking with several Ubisoft employees, the feeling is that Ubisoft executives no longer wants to commit to release dates or games publically until they are confident of their releases. Perhaps because of mishaps like Skull &amp; Bones, which saw over half a dozen public delays, or the more recent example with Star Wars Outlaws, which has seen a reduction in its scope to release on time. </p>



<p>Why these things continue to happen at Ubisoft is a bigger story for a later date (but I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-ubisoft-from-low-morale-to-internal-tensions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest reading this article on low morale at the company</a>). Issues internally are not changing, but at least in the eyes of Ubisoft, a little more public caution over its games and release dates can go a long way. A trailer for Beyond Good and Evil 2 has been ready for over a year, but without any confidence in a release date; do they want to see another game with more constant public delays? Probably not. At least, we should hear more about the Beyond Good and Evil 20th-anniversary game soon, but where and when is anyone’s guess.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview.898260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is off to an interesting start, to say the least. Coming off the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">somewhat controversial decision to change the name</a>, BioWare re-introduced the series to fans with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">two-minute trailer that drew unfavorable comparisons to Fortnite and Marvel</a>. BioWare quickly followed with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-first-ever-gameplay-footage-ahead-of-tuesdays-reveal">twenty-second tease</a> that was met much more positively – yet another jolting turn in what has been a rollercoaster decade for the franchise since Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p><p>Over the weekend, I watched as BioWare finally took the wraps off Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the course of an hour-long presentation in which they showed off the character creator, a broad swath of the gameplay, and the battle system. Director Corinne Busche also took the time to answer some of my biggest questions around The Veilguard’s romantic options and exploration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First, the graphics. Running on the latest iteration of the Frostbite Engine, at least one source told me that The Veilguard targets 60fps. In a subsequent conversation, though, an EA representative said, “Dragon Age: The Veilguard will feature performance and quality modes on consoles to ensure players can choose the visual fidelity they prefer. We’ll have more to share on exact performance as we finish development in the coming months.”</p><p>Whatever the fidelity, it’s evident that The Veilguard is heavily stylized, and whether that look lands is mostly a matter of taste. It’s worth pointing out that Dragon Age has always been a riot of art styles and I’m not so sure that the series needs to return to the blood-spattered style of the original. What matters to me is polish and a cohesive sense of identity, and in that sense The Veilguard seems like a logical evolution of Inquisition, which itself was quite stylized. </p><p>Also, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguards-character-creator">The Veilguard actually has good hair this time around</a>, which, <em>finally</em>.</p><h2>In the shadow of Mass Effect 2</h2><p>For what it’s worth, there’s plenty of nods to longtime fans, including the return of Varric, who Busche calls the franchise’s “Obi-Wan Kenobi,” along with some “killer cameos.” It’s Varric who narrates the story’s opening section, recapping the events of previous games and explaining the motivations of Solas, aka the Dread Wolf. While The Veilguard is once again a standalone story, with Rook joining The Warden, Hawke, and the Inquisition in the ranks of Dragon Age protagonists, it starts in a breathless state of in media res as a group of heroes try to stop Solas before he tears apart the barrier between Thedas and the spirit world.</p><p>“We want to get you right in,” Busche explains. “Especially with an RPG where they can be quite lore-heavy, a lot of exposition at the front and remembering proper nouns, it can be very overwhelming.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p>What follows is basically one long action setpiece as the main characters sprint through Minrathous, a city under attack by demons (this is another big moment for fans, who have been waiting for ages to see the capital of the Tevinter Imperium). While it’s unwise to draw too many conclusions from such a brief section of the game, it’s easy to wonder just how linear The Veilguard will end up being.</p><p>“Yeah, so it is a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated,” Busche says, echoing a talking point that comes up repeatedly throughout the presentation. “We believe that's how we get the best narrative experience, the best moment-to-moment experience. However, along the way, these levels that we go to do open up, some of them have more exploration than others. Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game.”</p><p>Pressed for more details on sidequests and optional content, Busche says, “Some of them are [highly curated],  especially when it involves the motivations and the experiences of the companions. You're really along on this journey with them. Others, you're investigating a missing family… and the entirety of this bog is open up to you. You're searching for clues, finding a way to solve their disappearance. So really it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. But I do want to emphasize that hand-crafted and curated is our approach.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Alternate branching paths, mysteries, secrets, optional content you're going to find and solve. So it does open up, but it is a mission-based, highly curated game</p></div><p>It reminds me nothing so much as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a>, with The Lighthouse – The Veilguard’s equivalent of Skyhold – standing in for the Normandy. I suppose it only makes sense in light of Dragon Age’s unique relationship with Mass Effect 2. Fans will recall that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">original Dragon Age: Origins</a> was basically a AAA CRPG – a continuation of BioWare’s isometric RPG legacy on PC. Mass Effect 2 followed just a couple months later, garnering praise among mainstream critics for its transition to full third-person shooter. Ever since, BioWare has prioritized action over gritty RPG mechanics, and the latest Dragon Age is no different.</p><p>But The Veilguard’s connection to Mass Effect 2 perhaps runs even deeper than that. Mass Effect 2’s story centered around Shepard recruiting companions from around the galaxy, Dirty Dozen-style, before ultimately embarking on a Suicide Mission where every character is at risk of dying – one of the most famous quests in gaming history.</p><p>Busche hints that something similar might be in The Veilguard. Asked whether The Veilguard will feature permadeath, she teases, “I don't want to get into spoilers but you just might [lose some characters]. Now in what we saw there, obviously no one died. In a situation like that they can get injured, they can influence how they think about you. If they're ready to hit the field with you, it does get more dangerous. We might lose some people along the way.”</p><h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is more of an action game than ever</h2><p>So with that in mind, let’s talk a bit about Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s battle system, which reduces the party size from four to three and in so doing becomes more action forward than ever. It features what Busche calls “sophisticated animation canceling and branching,” with the design centered around dodging, countering, and using risk-reward charge attacks designed to break enemy armor layers. Much of its strategy lives in its ability wheel, which stops the action either by tapping or holding the shoulder button and allows you to issue orders as you see fit. In particular, companions can be kitted out as support units and healers, which Busche cites as a big player request after Inquisition.</p><p>“The combat system is an interesting challenge going into the fourth iteration of this game because as you know, every Dragon Age has reinvented combat to some degree,” Busche explains. “Of course, pause and play strategy is always the backbone of it. But what that means is that, in addition to fans of all three prior games and welcoming in an entirely new generation of fans, we've got a pretty diverse player base to accommodate to.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every IGN BioWare Game Review</h3></div></output><p>While she offers comparatively few specifics, Busche hints at some of the deeper strategy behind the battle system. Weaknesses and resistances will apparently play a major role in the combat, with abilities being designed to exploit them accordingly. One character might be able to plant a weakening debuff on an enemy, and another enemy might be able to detonate them. Likewise, the bonds that Rook forges with companions like Neve, a detective, and Harding, who returns from Inquisition as a full partner, determine how party members grow and what abilities become available. Those bonds are in turn determined by the choices you make using BioWare’s famous dialogue wheel, which returns for The Veilguard.</p><p>I was heartened to see some of this depth make its way into the battle system, which has a fluidity to it thatl Dragon Age: Inquisition lacked. It further includes individual specializations for each class, including Duelist, Saboteur, and Veil Jumper for Rogue, as well as an overarching backstory based on the faction you choose. Players used to choosing a backstory and having it be totally irrelevant to the story will be happy to know that it impacts the dialogue more this time.</p><p>After all it’s the characters who will determine the success of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Larian ironically stole some of BioWare’s thunder with Baldur’s Gate 3, but this is still the studio that gave us Leliana, Liara, and Varric among many others, and it practically invented the RPG romance as we know it today. It’s been less than a week since the first official trailer and <a href="https://x.com/FidzyO/status/1799943346175263057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Lucanis fanart is already manifesting on social media</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise</p></div><p>“Each of the companions that you journey with has really complex backstories, problems of their own, deep motivations. And these play out through some really well fleshed-out character arcs; missions that are unique to them, but ultimately tie into the larger story,” Busche says. “And along the way we'll make consequential decisions for each of them, sometimes affecting who they are, sometimes heart-wrenching – I've cried more than once – and sometimes pretty joyous.” </p><p>Many years ago, I stood in a room with Mike Laidlaw as he talked about the tremendous amount of work that David Gaider, Ben Gelinas, and other writers put into building Dragon Age’s world (Gaider, it should be mentioned, is very active on X/Twitter and is <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1799965308213743818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>definitely paying attention to The Veilguard</u></a>). That effort has earned the series an enduring fanbase despite being on hiatus for more than a decade. Busche, a self-described RPG fan who says she loved Baldur’s Gate 3, counts herself among them.</p><p>“I've been a fan of all three for different reasons. But Origins is when I fell in love with the franchise,” she says.</p><p>When The Veilguard arrives later this fall (it doesn’t yet have a firm release date), it will be more than a big moment for BioWare – it will be a huge moment for the fans. The Dragon Age fans I know, many of them women, are palpably excited to have this franchise back in their lives after waiting for so long. It’s too early to say whether or not Dragon Age: The Veilguard will live up to their expectations. All I know is that it’s good to finally be back in Thedas after all these years.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Here's how.</h2></div><section><p>Yes, you <em>will</em> be able to carry over your decisions from previous Dragon Age games into The Veilguard — it'll just work a little differently this time.</p><p>In an interview with IGN, Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director Corinne Busche says the ability to import your choices is "fully integrated into the character creator this time around." What's more, Busche confirmed that you'll be able to customize your Inquisitor if you want to remake your protagonist from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>.</p><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played. They might not remember [what they did in previous games]," Busche explains. "They might need that refresher and we don't want new players to feel like they're missing out on those decisions. So in the character creator, I like to call it<em> last time on Dragon Age</em>, but you can go into your past adventures and it, actually through tarot cards, tells you what the context was and what decision you want to make."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/10/dragonage-veilguard-4-blogroll-1718059907587.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Corrine Busch reveals how world state imports will work in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><p>When pressed further about if all the previous characters would be woven into The Veilguard, like Hawke, Busch says, "I won't say everybody, but yes, some of them."</p><p>What it sounds like is that BioWare may be abandoning <a href="https://dragonagekeep.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Age Keep</a>, which would allow you to export your world state from previous Dragon Age games into Inquisition through your save files. When asked if The Veilguard would read saves from <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age Origins</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/03/08/dragon-age-ii-review">Dragon Age II</a>, or Dragon Age: Inquisition, Busche confirmed that it wouldn't. </p><p>"The technology is so different and we wanted it to be in the client," she says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"What's not lost on us is that it's been 10 years since existing players have played.</p></div><p>Indeed, Busche also confirms that The Veilguard players won't have to link to their accounts for this option, as you'll be able to play the game fully offline. And, yes, it's a single-player game and has no microtransactions.</p><p>It's only the latest in a trove of information we've gotten about Dragon Age: The Veilguard lately, in addition to its extended gameplay showcase today. BioWare recently showed off the seven companions <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">in its Xbox Showcase trailer</a>, and before that, it officially announced that it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">changing its name from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Previously, BioWare general manager <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">Gary McKay told IGN in an interview</a> that Dragon Age: The Veilguard will allow you to "romance the companions you want," sparking speculation that the fourth game in the series would be making a change to the way romances were handled in previous entries. </p><p>Now, in a new interview with The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche, we've confirmed that yes, you <em>will</em> be able to romance any companion you want, regardless of your character's gender or race. It's a bit of a surprise for fans, considering that in previous Dragon Age games, the romanceable characters had different sexual orientations. Some were pansexual, sure, but others were heterosexual, others were only attracted to the same sex, and some could only be romanced if you were a certain race (Dragon Age: Inquisition's Solas, for example, could only be romanced by female elves).</p><p>But Busche pushes back on the idea that The Veilguard's companions are "playersexual," a term used to describe games where NPCs are specifically only attracted to the player character. She says she's seen playersexual "done in a number of games," and "it can be really off-putting where these characters are adapting to who you, the player, are."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy.</p></div><p>Rather, Busche insists that they're all specifically pansexual, and that might come through in what you learn about their backstories.</p><p>"Their past experiences or partners, they'll reference them and indeed who they'll become romantic with," Busche tells IGN. "For instance, we saw Harding. I might be playing a straight male character flirting with her, but I choose not to pursue a romance. She might get together with Taash. So my perception, my identity has no bearing on their identities and that comes through really strongly."</p><p>When asked if that means it won't take long for romance to become an option in The Veilguard, Busche confirms that you'll be able to start flirting with everyone pretty early, as you recruit all seven companions throughout the first act. But, she clarifies, "it's not until the later parts of the game where you really commit to romance and it gets pretty spicy."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/harding-1718064550125.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Lace Harding, who appeared in Dragon Age: Inquisition, will be one of the romanceable companions in The Veilguard. </figcaption></figure></output><h2>Speaking of spicy...</h2><p>Of course, Dragon Age: The Veilguard <em>is</em> a BioWare game, and games from the studio — specifically those in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series — are known to have some fairly explicit sex scenes. Busche confirms that The Veilguard will be no different, particularly towards the end of the game: "Of course, we are an M-rated game," she says. "We do have nudity."</p><p>There's also some obvious parallels to be made between The Veilguard and last year's critical darling Baldur's Gate 3. The latter became known not only for its deep romances (like The Veilguard, Baldur's Gate 3 player characters can romance any companion regardless of gender or race), but also for its sex scenes, including one involving a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form">Wild-Shaping Druid that went pretty viral</a>. </p><p>Busche isn't afraid to admit that she has played Baldur's Gate 3, and loved it, as she's an "an RPG fan through and through": "The more character-driven party-based RPGs with deep emotional connection, the better."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive.</p></div><p>"What I love about the two games is I think they live side by side in a really interesting way," she continues. "They're very different games, but those emotional connections and how the narratives hook you, I think there's space for both."</p><p>Specifically in regards to the sex scenes and how The Veilguard will handle theirs differently, Busche says some of Baldur's Gate 3's scenes were "shocking and comical in some ways, and I would say I loved that." </p><p>"Our companions, we want them to be relatable and fully realized. So they can get spicy, but in a way that I think people will actually relate to," she says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Basically:<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-lets-you-have-sex-with-a-druid-in-bear-form"> no bear sex</a>. Busche goes on to say that how sexually explicit the scenes are, too, will vary between characters. </p><p>"Some of them are more spicy than others," she reveals. "Just like real life, our companions have such diverse personalities. Some of them are more physical, more aggressive, and some of them are more... we have a gentleman necromancer, for instance, that is more intimate and sensual."</p><p>Our interview with Busche comes as BioWare continues to roll out information about the highly anticipated Dragon Age sequel, with a cinematic trailer having <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-revealed-alongside-familiar-faces-xbox-showcase-2024">dropped at the Xbox Showcase</a> over the weekend.

Only the citizens or weaponry on the first liberated planet is likely to be saved, the Major Order reads. Both planets are currently held by the Automatons, Helldivers 2's terrifying robot enemy faction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: Helldivers, a difficult decision lies ahead. Will you save the trapped survivors on Vernen Wells or the raw ingredients for the MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines on Marfark? <a href="https://t.co/U6wiK48YH2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U6wiK48YH2</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1800533719985311947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It’s a cool development from developer Arrowhead, whose Game Master Joel pulls the strings of Helldivers 2’s meta narrative from the shadows. And while this is all just a bit of fun, already the community is stressing over what to do.</p><p>“We can create more kids, we need the mines now,” reads a post from one player. “We're never getting those mines….” said another. Some are even suggesting Arrowhead is hiding some secret reward behind saving the children, although that doesn’t sound like a very Super Earth thing to do.</p><p>Given how hardcore Helldivers 2 players have struggled to shepherd the wider player base in a single direction for previous Major Orders, there’s a risk here that neither planet is liberated, which would be awful for everyone. Perhaps there’s time for both to be saved. It will be interesting to see which way the galactic wind blows on this one.</p><p>This Major Order comes ahead of this week’s new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-reveals-jungle-themed-premium-warbond-viper-commandos-heres-what-to-expect">jungle-themed premium warbond</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2s-next-big-patch-makes-over-100-changes-and-fixes-including-some-that-should-significantly-improve-the-game">hotly anticipated game-changing patch</a>, which makes over 100 fixes and improvements to Helldivers 2. Both should hit on Thursday, June 31.</p><p>This week is a big one for Helldivers 2 and Arrowhead, which recently revealed it was in the process of setting the studio up so it could “make more and better stuff” in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, new CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and now current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console maker’s controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lego-horizon-adventures-shows-even-playstation-knows-growth-lies-beyond-your-own-platform-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>A Sony IP on a Nintendo device shows increasing platform holder efforts to reach new audiences</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The unveiling of Lego Horizon Adventures was not a surprise. As is often the case around major debuts, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-rumoured-lego-horizon-game-reportedly-coming-day-one-to-pc-ps5">hints and details had leaked out</a> in the days before.</p>
<p>What was surprising, however, was that not only is the game coming to PlayStation 5 and PC (as expected), but it is also coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Let's take a moment to process that: a PlayStation-owned IP on a Nintendo platform.</p>
<p>As far as I can Google, such a thing has not occurred in decades – not since, as <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring reminded me, Wipeout 64. Yes, Sony's MLB The Show is also available for Switch as well as Xbox, but that's a licensed title rather than a property PlayStation owns.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures may not have been the biggest blockbuster with which to open Summer Game Fest, but it's perhaps the most symbolic reveal we've seen throughout this year's array of showcases: seeing PlayStation IP coming to a Nintendo console is almost akin to Mario and Sonic appearing in the same game, both of which the '90s child in me sees as a sign of peace between the major players in the console war of that era.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, there was a lot of discussion around Microsoft going multiplatform, with simple <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reportedly-bringing-indiana-jones-and-starfield-to-ps5-and-switch">rumours that Starfield and Indiana Jones were coming to PS5</a> escalating into full-blown conspiracies that Xbox was going to stop making consoles (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles#:~:text=Microsoft%20is%20still%20working%20on%20hardware%20for%20the%20future%2C%20saying%20the%20focus%20for%20the%20next%20generation%20is%20%22delivering%20the%20largest%20technical%20leap%20you%20will%20ever%20have%20seen%20in%20a%20hardware%20generation.%22">it isn't</a>).</p>
<p>It transpired that Microsoft was bringing just <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-bringing-four-games-to-other-consoles">four games to other consoles</a>, and they <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-announces-slate-of-four-titles-launching-on-non-xbox-systems">weren't exactly flagship titles</a>. Starfield and Indiana Jones are still bound for Xbox and PC only as far as we're aware (for now?), while some of the firm's upcoming titles, like the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-new-gears-of-war-and-doom-headline-xbox-showcase-2024">newly-announced Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, will also come to PS5. In fact, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/06/xbox-you-are-going-to-see-more-of-our-games-on-more-platforms">Pure Xbox</a> reports that, during an on-stage interview at IGN Live on Sunday, Microsoft gaming CEO Phil Spencer said: "You are going to see more of our games on more platforms."</p>
<p>The point is, as we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/does-it-make-sense-for-xbox-to-bring-its-games-to-playstation-microcast">discussed</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/will-xbox-publishing-on-rival-consoles-spark-a-revolution-opinion">at</a> <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/multiplatform-microsoft-and-a-very-different-future-for-consoles-this-week-in-business">length</a> earlier this year, there are a myriad reasons why it makes sense for Microsoft to release select titles on other platforms: the need to reach more players, the limits of its own install base, growing its brand to grow its ecosystem. Much the same applies to PlayStation.</p>

<p>Sony has already <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/12-live-service-games-usd300m-pc-sales-aggressive-mobile-strategy-playstation-lays-out-its-plans">openly discussed</a> its plans to grow both its audience and its revenue with a string of PC ports for its blockbuster hits – including both Horizon titles – as well as upcoming but as-yet-unannounced mobile titles. After a few years of ports, PC is working out nicely for PlayStation with president and COO Hiroki Totoki telling investors earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-seeking-growth-by-bringing-more-first-party-games-to-other-platforms">Sony will be doubling down on this strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing your previously-exclusive titles to other platforms has many benefits: it reaches new audiences, raises awareness of your brands, gains you insight into what does and doesn't work with those communities.</p>
<p>Even for a market leader like Sony, growth is limited on their own platform. PS5 may be the most profitable PlayStation to date, but its sales have been tracking behind the PS4 – and a PC port reaches those who might be interested but lack the required hardware.</p>
<p>So, with Sony already reaching PC and mobile, targeting Nintendo with Lego Horizon Adventures makes perfect sense once the initial shock has worn off.</p>
<p>For starters, the Switch represents a sizeable audience at over 140 million units sold – more than 20 million more than the PlayStation 4, which still represents <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-5-now-represents-50-of-sonys-active-console-base">50% of Sony's active audience</a>, and more than double the PS5's current sales.</p>
<p>For another thing, it's a <em>different </em>audience (and arguably more so than PC). Nintendo has historically always attracted a family audience including a lot of younger players, often more successfully than Sony has. This likely explains why the debut of a PlayStation IP on Switch is a Lego spin-off, as opposed to a mainline entry. It's also more feasible to create something new that looks in keeping with other Switch titles than trying to port a PS5 powerhouse to Nintendo's more limited device.</p>
<p>And using Nintendo platforms to bring your IP to a broader, more family-focused audience isn't even a new thing. Microsoft expressly said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-hopes-ds-helps-viva-pi-ata-reach-broader-audience">this was the reason it was bringing Viva Pinata to DS</a> way back in 2008.</p>
<p>It's also fascinating that PlayStation has opted to take a new Nintendo-like direction with one of its mature franchises. While Horizon isn't as violent as, say, The Last of Us, it is heavy with its brooding protagonist and story of environmental apocalypse; this makes it an interesting choice given the more obvious fit for a Nintendo audience would be the likes of Astro Bot (which happens to have a new game out this September), Sackboy, Tearaway or perhaps Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p>
<p>PlayStation's targeting of Nintendo's audience speaks to a trend we've seen growing in recent years: all three platform holders are increasingly trying to reach different demographics by looking beyond their own ecosystems.</p>
<p>Xbox, which has always brought its games to PC, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-mobile-store-to-launch-this-summer">will reach mobile this summer</a> in addition to targeting PlayStation gamers (a similar audience to Xbox) with select titles. Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-mobile-strategy-is-about-reaching-new-audiences">still dabbles in mobile</a> to reach more casual players; for example, a recent Super Mario Run event was used to promote Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. And now, in addition to PC, PlayStation is prioritising the growth opportunities available via the Switch over its historic rivalry with Nintendo (granted, Nintendo removed itself from direct competition with other consoles with the Wii in 2006).</p>
<p>And it's not just about bringing games to other consoles. As former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden told us <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/where-will-you-be-playing-games-in-the-future-ign-live-2024">during our IGN Live panel</a> on Sunday, the total console userbase has been hovering around the 200 million to 250 million mark for multiple generations now, only briefly exceeding this during the Wii's heyday.</p>
<p>This means to grow your brand, to grow your audience, you need to look beyond not just your own consoles and those of your rivals, but into other forms of entertainment. Xbox has the Halo TV series, while its subsidiary Bethesda had a smash hit this year with the Fallout show on Amazon Prime. Nintendo has the biggest animated movie of the year in 2023 with Mario's cinematic outing. These grow brands and attract new audiences in ways no amount of video game spin-offs could manage.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch demonstrates how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Sony has been trying to broaden Horizon's reach for years. The Call of the Mountain spin-off was the headline launch title for PlayStation VR 2 last year, and there are already a range of transmedia products and merchandise available – from the Titan-published comics series and the special edition Lego sets (showing a pre-established relationship between Lego and Aloy) to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-tv-series-called-horizon-2074">animated Netflix series that's in the works</a>.</p>
<p>Back in the real of video games, it's unclear how much of a precedent this particular title will set. Lego Horizon Adventures coming to Switch doesn't necessarily mean the first two Horizon games are coming to Xbox – putting a family-friendly spin-off on a console with over 100 million players, many of whom have flocked to Lego games, makes more sense than porting Aloy's blockbuster adventures to a device with less than half the audience (and an audience that is likely less family-orientated). It's worth highlighting that even this Lego spin-off isn't coming to Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Nor does all this mean that Nintendo will follow suit by putting Mario spin-offs on PlayStation or Xbox. The 150 million or so players these two ecosystems represents holds less growth potential than making movies and mobile games that appeal to a far larger audience.</p>
<p>PlayStation and particularly Nintendo will continue to protect and prioritise their own platforms – after all, these are their primary sources of revenue. But Lego Horizon Adventures on Switch does at least demonstrate how the landscape has changed; there are now gates between the walled gardens.</p>
<p>It's also premature to declare the death of the exclusives. There is room for both multiformat games and console exclusives, and PlayStation's current strategy still centres around 'killer apps' to draw people to its ecosystem. But while its flagship games remain the biggest attractor to PlayStation – case in point: Astro Bot, a game that fully demonstrates the technical wizardry of the DualSense controllers – the brand extensions, like a Lego spin-off, can serve to introduce the IP to new audiences that companies would otherwise be incapable of reaching.</p>
<p>Will Lego Horizon Adventures drive Switch owners to buy a PS5 or a beefy PC, and pick up Aloy's full-scale adventures? Time will tell. But you can bet Sony will be watching the performance of this title closely. When we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jim-ryan-i-would-love-a-world-where-hundreds-of-millions-will-enjoy-our-games">spoke to former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in 2021</a>, he talked about how Sony was interested in finding ways to reach hundreds of millions of players with its games. Taking its brands beyond PlayStation consoles is essential to accomplishing this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/06/11/arcane-season-2-which-will-be-the-final-chapter-gets-a-new-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Netflix had released a new trailer for Season 2 of <em>Arcane</em>, the hit animated series set in the League of Legends universe. Set to premiere in November, show creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee confirm the upcoming season will be the show's last.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AEbfiLaOdJA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2 is billed as "the final chapter" and will center on Jinx's attack on the Council, which will be the centerpiece of the escalating Piltover/Zaun conflict. Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Ella Purnell (Jinx) will reprise their roles in Season 2. While Arcane will be concluding, Christian Link stated during a LoL dev update released earlier today that it won't be the last animated story set in the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“<em>Arcane</em> is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche," said Linke. "From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of <em>Arcane</em> wraps up with this second season. But <em>Arcane</em> is just the first of many stories that we want to tell in Runeterra.”</p>

<p>You can watch the first teaser for <em>Arcane</em> Season 2 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/01/05/arcane-season-2-gets-first-teaser-trailer">here</a>.

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">True to its promise from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-promises-massive-improvements-2024-key-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">early this year</a>, <em>Forza Motorsport</em> developer Turn 10 has been hard at work improving the game with each subsequent update, delivering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsports-car-progression-rework-is-now-out-and-its-a-huge-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some much-needed wins</a> in this respect. The new Update 9 continues this trend with endurance events, but with a huge asterisk in tow.</p> <p data-characters="642" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">As I myself have bemoaned time and again here at Destructoid, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-two-types-of-fomo-present-in-forza-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza</em> developers are huge fans of transient, temporary content</a>. The introduction of proper, full-blooded endurance races that take a fair bit of time to wrap up and force the player to consider their tire compound, fuel economy, and other such items has got to be a permanent addition though, right? Well, no, because <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-motorsport-is-insistent-on-not-adding-permanent-new-career-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Forza Motorsport</em> absolutely insists that all of its post-launch content has <em>got</em> to be time-limited</a>. That’s right: endurance racing is just a timed event in <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, and it will be available for the duration of Update 9, from June 12 until July 24.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Endurance Month Trailer | Forza Motorsport" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TnrMF3CKNcM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-enjoy-endurance-racing-in-forza-motorsport-s-update-9-for-about-a-month" data-injectable="false">Enjoy endurance racing in Forza Motorsport’s Update 9, for about a month</h2> <p data-characters="645" data-current-count="945" data-injectable="true">Endurance racing is not everyone’s cup of tea, that much should be a given, but the fact that these events are being relegated to a mere footnote on one of the pages of <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s post-launch support is disappointing indeed. Had <em>Forza Motorsport</em> simply kept around even just one half of its monthly events instead of permanently removing them from the game with each new update, it would by now have one of the biggest, most varied career modes of all modern simcade racing titles. But, here we are, with Update 9’s admittedly impressive roster of endurance races coming out with a <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sunsetting timer attached by default</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">The fact that endurance events are being done dirty in such a manner, then, does put a hefty dampener on Update 9’s flagship feature: the Sebring International Raceway track. This comes after Update 8 did not have a new race track attached to it, making the release of a legendary new raceway that much more important for the game’s long-term health and variety.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Update 9 also introduces some minor tweaks to the Laguna Seca and Nürburgring Nordschleife tracks, improving their real-world accuracy, as well as the option to disable temporal anti-aliasing on PC. The VRAM use estimator, too, has been updated to be useful, as Turn 10 is actively looking into the shift timing problem that has persisted up until now on PC.</p>
 <p data-characters="604" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">There is one last thing that could either prove to be a big nothingburger or yet another point of contention for the community: <em>Forza Motorsport</em>‘s Update 9 is the first piece of post-launch content to come with a purchasable DLC attached to it. Notably, the game’s Car Pass DLC is now done and dusted, but Turn 10 seemingly aims to continue releasing bonus vehicles as the game goes on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2921330/Forza_Motorsport_Porsche_963_Combo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The new Porsche 963 Combo DLC</a>, for example, includes the titular racing car and a Porsche racing suit for the low, low price of $4,99. Granted, you <em>can</em> claim this DLC at absolutely no charge until June 19.</p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">Note that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has already nurtured a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5-turns-into-forza-motorsport-new-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">steady cadence</a> of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/forza-horizon-5s-retrowave-season-brings-us-minecraft-cosmetics-a-new-radio-station-and-hyundai-n-vision-74/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC-locked cars</a> on top of its timed content structure, which can get expensive if you’re out to collect all or most of them. Whereas <em>Horizon</em> usually nets you at least a handful of cars for $4,99, though, <em>Motorsport</em>‘s first outing of this type is far, far weaker in comparison. Interesting times ahead, for sure.</p>

<p data-characters="485" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden closure of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Studios</a> has understandably left many worried about the future of Microsoft’s other internal studios, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-outer-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Outer Worlds</a></em> developer Obsidian Entertainment. Perhaps to help dispel fears of Obsidian meeting the same fate, Carrie Patel and Matt Hansen, the director and art director of the upcoming <em>Avowed</em>, have commented on how supportive they feel Microsoft has been throughout development.</p> <p data-characters="680" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">“It’s always sad and it always sucks to see studios close and devs lose their job,” said Patel in a recent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-dont-believe-in-living-in-fear-obsidian-talks-avowed-release-date-prospects-and-xbox-studio-closures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> interview. “I really hope all those people land on their feet, because I know our industry is better with them in it.” However, she doesn’t believe in “living in fear,” adding that she feels a “a strong sense of security in being part of Obsidian” and has a lot of trust in Microsoft’s leadership: “I do want to emphasise that Microsoft leadership and Xbox leadership have also been incredible supportive of what we do, how we make games, and [are] very communicative with us as well.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Xbox</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">Hansen also describes the closures as “unfortunate,” in the Eurogamer interview, but is otherwise “not afraid” about Obsidian’s future under Microsoft. He adds, “The only side effect that I’ve personally felt since Microsoft acquired us is just more support. There’s less unknowns, less financial risk, and so we’re able to take more creative risk—but to do that in a measured way. It’s been a really, really rewarding process.”</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">As for <em>Avowed</em> itself, the fantasy RPG saw another new trailer at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/everything-shown-at-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it still otherwise looks like a fun time. It didn’t get a lot of focus, though, and Microsoft hasn’t nailed down an exact release date beyond fall 2024. A blog post from Obsidian did <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/avowed-brelease-date-accidentally-announced-before-swiftly-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mention a November 12 launch</a>, but that date has since been excised. Whether this is simply because it was shared too early or isn’t set in stone is unclear.</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">While it’s nice to hear Obsidian is being supported well, there’s not much to offer in terms of reassurance after so many layoffs in recent years. Let’s not forget that Microsoft considered <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hi-fi-rush-destructoid-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a></em> a success, and yet developer Tango Gameworks was shut down anyway.</p>

<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s now official – superstar Christian McCaffrey will be present on the cases of <em>Madden 25</em> as he has been selected as this year’s cover star athlete.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">There were several candidates, and the speculations have been intense during the last few days. However, the results are now in, and EA Sports has undoubtedly picked a suitable candidate. The 49ers running back has been a phenomenal performer over the years and was selected as the OPOY last season.</p> <h2 id="h-christian-mccaffrey-could-certainly-boost-sales-of-madden-25" data-injectable="false">Christian McCaffrey could certainly boost sales of Madden 25</h2> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">2024 will be a big year for EA Sports as far as American Football is concerned. July will witness the launch of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-sports-college-football-25-editions-overview-which-to-buy/">EA Sports College Football 25</a></em>, while Madden 25 is expected to be released globally in August. So far, fans have been waiting for the cover athlete reveal, and Christian McCaffrey is undoubtedly a great choice.</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">His stocks have risen further following a trade with the 49ers. McCaffrey’s talent was already evident for many years, and especially in 2019, when the man completed 1,000 rushing and 1,000 receiving yards in the same season. This made him only the third athlete to do so, which only shows how unique the achievement is even today.</p> <figure data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">McCaffrey will hope to go one step further next season, after losing to the Kansas City Chiefs at the Superbowl. Last year, he also led the charts in terms of rushing yards, but a victory at the Superbowl will have been remarkable. Hopefully, he will manage to lead his side to the coveted title next year.</p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="false"><em>Madden 25</em> is currently available for pre-order, and you can choose between the Standard and Digital Deluxe Editions. The latter, while being more expensive, offers a lot of extra goodies and three days of early access. The Digital Deluxe Edition is also part of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-ea-sports-college-football-25-prices-standard-edition-deluxe-edition-mvp-bundle/">MVP bundle</a>, which also includes the <em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> Digital Deluxe Edition at a discounted price.</p>

<p data-characters="326" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Given that it’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-is-officially-the-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially the fastest-selling PlayStation game <em>ever</em> made</a>, you’d expect <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s content updates to continue dropping in at a blistering pace. This is no longer the case, however, as Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowed the updating cadence way down</a> ahead of the hotly anticipated spawn rate fix.</p> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">“You’ve probably noticed we’ve slowed our cadence of patches,” said Arrowhead Games on Twitter. “Similar to our future approach to Warbonds, this is so we can dedicate more time to each patch to reduce the pressure on our teams, dig into your feedback more, and deliver higher-quality patches.” The wait, thankfully, is almost over, as the big update is dropping in alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the new Viper Commandos Premium Warbond</a>.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-fixes-its-biggest-outstanding-issues-on-june-13" data-injectable="false">Helldivers 2 fixes its biggest outstanding issues on June 13</h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true">This jots down <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s spawn fix update for release on June 13, or just two days from the publication of this article. Being <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the questionably efficient solo <em>Helldivers 2</em> player that I am</a>, it’s obvious that my biggest concern is whether the spawn rates are reverted to their previous proper state, but I’m equally thrilled with some of the other improvements slated for this update.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">As per Arrowhead Games’ post on Twitter, we’re looking at over 100 total changes and fixes, with some of the most notable tweaks (aside from the spawn rates) being the visibility of in-game military supply lines and attack origins, the introduction of invite-only fireteam lobbies, Super Samples being available from level 6 onwards, and heaps more. Good stuff all around, no two ways about it.</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">“We’re very aware that going from quick, small patches to slower, bigger patches means [the community’s] expectations are higher,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fpatch-note-date-confirmed-v0-eeqyk3nflr5d1.png%3Fwidth%3D637%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Ddbaa4b4e8c2ebe1a80b35cec7b6d99011d839c65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead says</a>. “While we think the next patch is strong, with lots of bug fixes &amp; requested features, we’re definitely not resting on our laurels or being complacent.”</p> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-community-figures-out-the-invisible-supply-line-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The visibility of supply lines and attack vectors</a>, in particular, is a surprising but most welcome addition. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is filled to the brim with extremely deep but intentionally obtuse features and mechanics that have only been revealing themselves to the players as they engaged with the game. Opening up more of this information to the end user is bound to be a good thing, and the only thing that remains to be seen is exactly <em>how</em> Arrowhead Games has chosen to organize it all in the UI.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">There’s one more thing to keep in mind as the next major update drops in: the Illuminate faction is seemingly looming closer than ever. Hints are dropping in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-cant-take-all-the-illuminate-teases-from-the-devs-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-teases-illuminate-faction-again-following-incident-that-spaghettified-scientists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-turns-meridia-into-black-hole/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meridia’s already been turned into a decidedly strange black hole</a> as part of a recent combat operation. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/why-undocumented-patch-notes-should-be-the-norm-for-helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patch notes aren’t the be-all-end-all for Arrowhead Games</a>, after all.</p>

According to Netflix, the final chapter of the <em>League of Legends</em> adaptation sets up a “dire escalation” between the cities of Piltover and Zaun — and sisters Vi and Jinx.</p><p>Just because this is the final season, it doesn’t mean we won’t see any more <em>League of Legends</em> adaptations going forward. In <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/tldw-gameplay-esports-arcane-dev-update/">a League Dev Update posted</a> on Tuesday, the <em>Arcane</em> team says this is only the “first of many stories they will tell in Runeterra.”</p><p>“<em>Arcane </em>is just the beginning of our larger storytelling journey and partnership with the wonderful animation studio that is Fortiche,” <em>Arcane</em> producer Christian Linke says in a statement. “From the very beginning, since we started working on this project, we had a very specific ending in mind, which means the story of Arcane wraps up with this second season.”</p><p>The <em>Arcane</em> team says it’s currently working on new projects in both TV and film and that we can expect to hear an update by the end of this year. <em>Arcane</em>’s second season still doesn’t have an exact release date, but Netflix says it will arrive in November 2024.</p><div><p>The <em>League of Legends </em>adaptation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763818/netflix-league-of-legends-arcane-review">made its debut on Netflix in 2021</a> in collaboration with developer Riot Games. It has <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/03/2022-annie-awards-winners-list-movies-tv-video-games-1234974570/">won several awards</a> and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/5/23337974/netflix-arcane-streaming-win-animation-emmy-award-league-of-legends">became the first streaming series</a> to win an Emmy for an outstanding animated program. The first season follows <em>League</em> champions Jinx and Vi — two sisters torn apart by a class conflict.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It took over a month of racing and 220 hours of playtime but a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a> player has finally beaten the racing game's most horrendously difficult map. For those of you only now noticing that tens of thousands of Twitch viewers have been religiously watching video game Hot Wheels, let me elucidate. Deep Dip 2 is a fan-made tower of racetracks that was published as a challenge to the racing game's community <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-racing-game-players-are-11-days-into-an-exhausting-race-to-climb-a-deadly-tower">last month</a>. It is 16 floors of unfathomably difficult ramps, tunnels, ledges, pipes, and beams. A simple mistake sees drivers plummeting to the bottom, like the sad cauldron man of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>. The first three players to finish would share a prize pool of over $32,000. Over the weekend, one player has now managed it, and another has since joined him. Third place is still up for grabs but, mate, I wouldn't recommend it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first to finish was French player Brendan "Bren_TM2" Seve, who <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2166634084?t=01h11m28s">streamed the final run</a> with both his microphone and camera turned off in an effort to focus more fully on the nightmarish final floors. Someone on YouTube has put together a nice compilation of highlights, starting with this hairy moment, in which the racer <a href="https://youtu.be/7gfdteqfMQU?feature=shared&amp;t=59">literally drives along a goddamn wall</a>. The final jump is particularly frightening - a vertical hurtle toward a finish line suspended in mid-air, hanging thousands of kilometres above the starting line. Every jump in Deep Dip 2 seems to require total commitment. But the final one has special tension. After a practice approach, Seve gunned his engines and went for the last leap. He made it. </p>
<p>"I thought I didn't make the last jump, I thought I was lacking speed," he said, coming back on-camera (but not before leaping on his bed and unplugging his own headset in the heat of the moment). "I'm shaking like crazy. We're done." </p>
<p>"I'm so happy," said Seve. "I'm so relieved... The last jump, I was afraid I would go down without having enough speed. This is insane. I'm so happy... I've never been so stressed playing Trackmania ever."</p>
<p>The player was met with a congratulations message from the map's makers. "Congratulations, you've done it!" said the audio message. "The metaphorical Everest. You made it to the top. You were willing to fail and because of that, you have achieved something not many will accomplish. You have conquered Deep Dip 2... Now go celebrate, you've earned it."</p>
<p>Seve takes away half of the prize pool, over $15,000, leaving the remaining money for others to follow. The second prize has since been nabbed by Czech player Filip "eLconn21" Šprungl, whose own final run <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2166588703?t=05h45m00s">was also broadcasted on Twitch</a> not long afterwards. He'll take home the second prize of about $9000.</p>
<p>While the third place is still up for grabs, according to <a href="https://deepdip2.com/leaderboard">the leaderboards</a>, the map will soon be broken down into separate floors so that any player can try each floor for themselves. </p>
<p>This is the second time Seve has won such a competition, having beaten the previous Deep Dip as well. He said the feeling of beating this one was "better than the first" although he did admit it wasn't happy hiking all the time, as you might expect from a gruelling month-long challenge broadcast to thousands of people every day.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad I'm not on floor three right now, sweating," he said.</p>
<p>That difficulty and stress set in for a lot of the racers, with some wondering out loud if the course was too difficult. One of the racers, "Wirtual", <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/they-have-been-racing-for-a-month">gave up on the 14th floor</a>. Which sounds like the action of a real quitter. Until you recognise this same player once completed Trackmania blindfolded. That's how hard this course was. Whether a Deep Dip 3 continues the trend some day in the long-running <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> racing game, we'll have to wait and see. For now, Wirtual has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULDE0D6wPnk">a thorough run-down of the month-long event</a> that is worth a watch if you want absolutely all the ups and downs. </p>

  <p id="6ID6xa"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s upcoming <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079161/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-preorder-guide-standard-deluxe-premium-collectors-edition">is less than two weeks from its June 21 release date</a> — so if you want to play it immediately upon launch, you’ll want to get to work now. That’s because there are some requirements to play <em>Shadow of the Erdtree.</em> You don’t need to have completed the game, but you <em>do</em> need to have beaten two specific bosses to enter <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Shadow Realm: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg, Lord of Blood</a>.</p>
<p id="sSRXEM">“Friendly PSA for all those looking forward to #ELDENRING Shadow of the Erdtree,” publisher Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1800330011171496440">posted to X</a>. “You have less than 2 weeks to prepare!”</p>

<p id="AwAokG">Don’t fret if you <em>aren’t</em> fully prepared; you can take comfort in the fact that there are plenty of people right there with you. Each of these bosses has an achievement tied to them: Shardbearer Radahn and Shardbearer Mohg, respectively. By tracking those achievements on each platform, we can see the percentage of people who are — and <em>aren’t </em>— ready for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. Let’s break down the numbers.</p>
<h3 id="Tqghve"><strong>Shardbearer Radahn</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="r4QpEO">
<em>Windows PC via Steam </em>— 54.5% of players have the achievement, so roughly 45% of people <em>haven’t</em> beaten the boss</li>
<li id="4vsXoS">
<em>PlayStation 5</em> — 46.6% of players have the achievement, so around 53% of people have yet to beat Radahn</li>
<li id="sfvZSI">
<em>Xbox Series X</em> — 32.8% of players have this achievement, so roughly 67% of players need to beat Radahn</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Zqmo9q"><strong>Shardbearer Mohg</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="sUqQ0f">
<em>Windows PC via Steam </em>— 38.7% of people have the achievement, so around 61% of people still need to beat Mohg</li>
<li id="be04sL">
<em>PlayStation 5</em> — 34.7% of people have the achievement, so around 65% of people haven’t beaten the boss</li>

<em>Xbox Series X</em> —22.8% of players have this achievement, so around 77% of players need to beat Mohg</li>
</ul>
<p id="0nZXRO">Xbox players have a lot of catching up to do! There are likely a whole bunch of people who haven’t beaten either boss, which makes the task even harder. But on average, 55% of players still need to beat Radahn, while an average of 68% of players still need to take on Mohg.</p>
<p id="mZ79Hp">Of course, these numbers are likely a little skewed by people who bought the game but barely played it; on Steam, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23054151/roundtable-hold-npcs-encounters">just 77.8% of people reached <em>Elden Ring</em>’s Roundtable Hold</a>, which is basically the player hub. We can assume that the 22% of Steam players who stopped before reaching the Roundtable Hold probably won’t pick up <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> — or, maybe, it’ll be their welcome back to the world.</p>
<p id="1BkrzK">There’s very little in <em>Elden Ring</em> that’s easy, so if you’re looking for help in your <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> prep, head over to Polygon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Starscourge Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mogh, Lord of Blood</a> guides.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/marvels-spider-man-2-version-1-003-000-update-launches-june-18-adds-eight-new-suits<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the details below.</p><div><h2><span>New Suits</span></h2><p>First, we’re delighted to fully unveil four new suits created in partnership with Colm Dillane, <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">AKA</a> KidSuper, and some special guest collaborators. Evenly split between the Spider heroes, these are new takes on Spidey suits designed from the ground up by KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. Check them out—along with some notes from each designer!</p><p><strong>Metro Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) – Designed by KidSuper</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>Fashion designer, Colm Dillane, AKA KidSuper, created the Metro suit for Miles Morales, which comes with additional variant suit styles: red on black, classic Spidey, and teal on purple. KidSuper not only partnered with us to make these suits, but he also worked closely with our special guests to design their suits!</p><p>KidSuper’s Comment: “The puffer design you often see in my KidSuper collections and the exclusive ‘original’ colorway! We came up with designs that felt super original, like something only we could pull off.”</p><p><strong>Ginga Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) – Co-Designed by Vini Jr. and KidSuper</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Professional Football player Vini Jr. wears his inspiration on his sleeve. A love letter to Brazil and the beautiful, global game of Football, the Ginga suit features a design and default colorway reminiscent of both: a sporty look for Miles Morales with a black, green, yellow, and blue shader. Of course, this suit also features added styles: red on black, classic, and gold on white.</p><p>Vini Jr.’s Comment: “I wanted it to be a celebration of Brazil’s culture and people. I just love the overall design because it has the energy and <a title="Genres > Action [1,925 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> that I associate Spider-Man with, but it’s beautifully mixed with some Brazilian flair. Which makes this suit super special and different from others.”</p><p><strong>Fluro Suit</strong> (Peter Parker) – Co-Designed by Lando Norris and KidSuper </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Motorsports phenom Lando Norris is all about moving fast. Paired with the high-speed action of <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, Norris’ suit reflects the pace—wholly inspired by <a title="Genres > Racing [185 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>, complete with a helmet and overalls familiar to those who burn rubber across global circuits. The Fluro Suit features its own suit styles with some variants such as a classic color scheme, white on black, and pink on blue.</p><p>Lando Norris’ Comment: “The main inspiration for the design was the feeling of speed. I also wanted to incorporate racing elements and materials like carbon, along with my trademark Fluro colour, which you can see throughout the suit. The carbon style effect on the suit is my favourite.”</p><p><strong>Motorchic Suit</strong> (Peter Parker) – Co-Designed by Rina Sawayama and KidSuper</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Singer/Actress/Model Rina Sawayama delivers a badass motorbike look to Spidey’s locker. Decked out in all leather, the Motorchic suit gives Peter Parker a revved-up design unique from any other in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2. The suit features other variants as well: a classic color scheme, black, and gold.</p><p>Rina Sawayama’s Comment: “I really wanted to explore my love of fashion whilst making this suit and what we ended up with I think encapsulates that, it’s fun, practical, edgy and chic. I personally love the metal detailing across the suit, it still feels like what I envision as classic Spider-Man but adds a more rugged feel. It looks pretty heavy duty and like it would stand up very well in combat!”</p><h2><span>Legacy Suits</span></h2><p>We’re also thrilled to announce four fan-favorite legacy suits from <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> and <em><a title="Games > Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/marvels-spider-man-miles-morales">Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</a></em> are being added to the game! Based on community requests, these four suits are being retrofitted for <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, including two for Peter and two for Miles. See what’s in store below!</p><p><strong>Last Stand Suit</strong> (Peter Parker)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Donning a red leather jacket, the Last Stand suit is a highly requested fan favorite coming to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>! Now updated with our suit styles, the Last Stand suit gets a more classic variant, full black, and an Arachno-Man-inspired yellow and green. </p><p><strong>Into The Spider-Verse</strong> (Peter Parker)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Inspired by Peter B. Parker’s design in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, this iconic look adds a Spider-verse flare to Peter Parker’s wardrobe. Enable the Film Style Animation mode via visual settings to get an even more authentic, filmic look!</p><p><strong>Animated Suit</strong> (Miles Morales) </p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Miles gets a little animated. We’re adding Miles Morales’ Animated suit to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>. This suit is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old.</p><p><strong>Uptown Pride Suit</strong> (Miles Morales)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marvels-Spider-Man-2_2024_06-11-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p>Complete with a gold trim, the Uptown Pride suit is a beloved favorite from <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> that’s making its way to <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>! This time, the Uptown Pride Suit gets added colorways: silver trim, black on red, and blue on pink. </p><h2><span>Stability Fixes</span></h2><p>Finally, our latest update brings stability fixes to the game and addresses some player feedback, such as the ability to swap out your parry and traversal abilities from the Symbiote to Spider Arms, and vice versa. This update, version 1.003.000, will be available on June 18th, so keep an eye out for it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-everything-new-in-the-june-update/2900-5461/" data-ref-id="2900-5461">June update</a> in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield </a>has delivered a plethora of new content to the Settled Systems. One major part of that content is the new Trackers Alliance missions, which can be completed after joining the bounty-hunting faction. The first mission you can accept for the Trackers Alliance is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-how-to-start-and-complete-the-starjacker-tracker-alliance-mission/2900-5465/" data-ref-id="2900-5465">The Starjacker</a>, which involves you hunting down a criminal named Hannibal. However, in order to find Hannibal, you first need to locate a man named Adrastos, who supposedly knows where the criminal is hiding.</p><p>You are tasked with locating Adrastos using the new bounty hunter scanning system in Starfield. However, the NPC still isn't easy to find even with the scanner, so look at the guide below to see where Adrastos is located.</p><h2>Adrastos Location in Starfield</h2><p>After going through the Trackers Alliance HQ and meeting with Agent No. 1, you and your new partner Roach set out to find Adrastos. Roach says the informant is wandering the streets of Akila City and tells you to use the bounty-scanner to identify the target. To use the bounty-scanner, simply press the normal keybind for your scanner that you would use when looking for resources on a planet. With the scanner out, hover over different people you see in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316860"></a><figcaption>Using the bounty-scanner to find Adrastos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316860-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.43.86.png"></figure><p>When the target you're looking for gets caught in your crosshairs, they'll be outlined in red. When hovering over a red target, you can see their name and their bounty on the screen. You want to have your scanner open the entire time when looking for Adrastos, otherwise the quest won't progress if you happen to find him.</p><p>With your scanner out, you need to head to the right from the Trackers Alliance HQ. Adrastos is normally located directly behind The Rock bar on the eastern side of Akila City. I found Adrastos leaning up against a wall right near the tarped area of the city, as you can see in the map screenshot below. However, depending on how long it takes you to find Adrastos, he may move to a different area. After reloading a few saves, though, Adrastos never drifted too far from the location on the map below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4316858"></a><figcaption>Adrastos' location in Akila City. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4316858-bethesdasoftworks.projectgold_3275kfvn8vcwcscreenshot2024.06.10-14.01.56.36.png"></figure><p>If you're having no luck finding Adrastos in this area, I suggest reloading a save from inside the Trackers Alliance HQ and trying the mission again. It's also important to remember to always have your scanner open when trying to identify Adrastos.</p><p>After finding him, you can now interrogate Adrastos with Roach. There are some clever lines of dialogue in this conversation, but the main goal of the exchange is to make Adrastos tell you where Hannibal and the Chop Shop are.

        <p>Former employee accuses third party QA firm used by Activision of violating rights of coworkers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Communications Workers of America has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges against Lionbridge Technologies, which Microsoft has been working with as a QA contractor on Activision projects.</p>
<p>The CWA issued the notion with the National Relations Board (NLRB), in which it alleged that Lionbridge violated the rights of its Boise, Idaho team.</p>
<p>The filing claimed that Lionbridge laid off the entire team after workers had engaged in collective action about their working conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, it accused the QA firm of offering severance packages with "overly broad confidentiality terms" which allegedly involved staff having to waive labour law rights which are protected by the National Labour Relations Act.</p>
<p>The filing also claimed workers were told the layoffs were the result of a project ending. However, the CWA noted that teams working on said project in Mexico and Poland were not let go.</p>
<p>The CWA also alleged that Lionbridge had previously engaged in union busting in 2016 when it laid off all union employees in Bellevue, Washington, shortly after a group of temporary workers signed their first union contract.</p>
<p>In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft and the CWA entered a labour neutrality agreement</a> that consisted of provisions to protect employees' rights to unionise and to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>The CWA said it expects Microsoft to extend this labour agreement to its contractors.</p>
<p>About the Unfair Labour Practice charges, former Lionbridge test associate Al Bussabarger commented: "We brought our concerns to management and organised with our coworkers to improve our working conditions. In response to these complaints, Lionbridge chose to lay off our entire team, in violation of our rights as coworkers.</p>
<p>"We do much the same work that union-represented Activision QA employees do, and Microsoft should make sure that everyone working on its games is treated with respect in line with its labour practices, including employees of contractors."</p>
<p>In 2023, Microsoft confirmed it would honour <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reiterates-labour-neutrality-agreement-following-abk-acquisition">its labour neutrality agreement with the CWA</a> following its acquisition of Activision. Last month, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-staff-now-included-in-microsoft-and-cwas-labour-neutrality-agreement">CWA announced that ZeniMax staff were covered</a> by the same agreement.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Activision for comment.</p>

<p>A suit inspired by Peter B. Parker's look will be available for Peter Parker, seen below, although it does lack his telltale gut. The other seven suits, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/11/marvels-spider-man-2-update-includes-suit-collab-and-fan-favorites-available-june-18/">which can be seen on PlayStation's blog</a>, have been created by guest designers KidSuper, Vini Jr, Lando Norris, and Rina Sawayama. There are also a few suits referencing specific Spider-Man lore, and a new Mile Morales suit (seen above) that "is reminiscent of classic cartoons and comics of old."</p>

		<p>BioWare and EA have debuted a solid 15 minutes of edited gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">the new name for Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – taking us into the city on Minrathous and exploring what will make up this long-awaited RPG sequel. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release later this year across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gameplay reveal features our player character Rook and series mainstay Varric as they delve into the very pretty, but seedy city of Minrathous on the hunt for Solas. Specifically they head down to Docktown to try and meet up with the renowned detective Neve Gallus, who apparently has a lead that they might be able to follow – especially as they’re one of the companions who will join you on your journey.</p>
<p>You’re in a race against time to stop Solas from conducting a ritual that’s breaking the barrier between world, the Veil, which is allowing demons to enter this world. Meeting up with Harding, you get to see the typical multi-choice BioWare dialogue system, with the script bending to accommodate Rook’s chosen origin story – being one of the Shadow Dragons in this demo.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of scripted moments on the path through the city, as well as battles with demons and cultists. Combat for the Rogue character class looks nice and fluid with a flippy attack style with two swords that’s fairly reminiscent of modern superhero games, and the ability to quickly whip out a bow and arrow for a little bit of range. However, there’s also the Ability Wheel, which freezes the game to let you select the next special ability you want to whip out and target it.</p>

<p>The demo then jumps to Arlathan Forest, where the ritual continues, and showed off a battle with a Pride Demon boss, able to summon lightning strikes &nbsp;pull off sweeping blade attacks, teleport around, and with multiple health bars to whittle away.</p>
<p>There’s a good blend of cutscenes and action through the demo, especially with the narrative finale of the video, but I’ve no doubt that fans of the franchise will want to see more of the wider open world instead of the heavily scripted and linear action featured here.</p>
<p>There will be seven companions, which BioWare promise will all be unique and unforgettable heroes. There’s an assassin, a necromancer, a detective and more, and yes, you’ll be able to romance them. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bellara</b>, a creative and romantic Veil Jumper obsessed with uncovering ancient secrets.</li>
<li><b>Davrin</b>,<b> </b>a bold and charming Grey Warden who has made a name for himself as a monster hunter.</li>
<li><b>Emmrich</b>, a necromancer of Nevarra’s Mourn Watch who comes complete with a skeletal assistant, Manfred.</li>
<li><b>Harding</b>, the dwarven scout, returns to the fray as a companion with her big heart, a positive outlook, and a ready bow – as well as unexpected magical powers.</li>
<li><b>Lucanis</b>, a poised &amp; pragmatic assassin who descends from the bloodline of the House of Crows, a criminal organization renowned throughout Thedas.</li>
<li><b>Neve</b>, a cynic fighting for a better future, both as a private detective and a member of Tevinter’s rebellious Shadow Dragons.</li>
<li><b>Taash</b>, a dragon hunter allied with the Lords of Fortune who lives for adventure and doesn’t mind taking risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s your combined journey that will be put to the forefront of this new game, so while the Dread Wolf is still a significant part of the game’s story, BioWare felt it important to rebrand to The Veilguard to make that distinction.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-everything-we-know-9415">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree releases on 21st June - that's just 10 days away.
</p>
<p>
Now is not the time to procrastinate, Tarnished! The Land of Shadow awaits, but it seems some players still haven't completed the necessary requirements.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, a social post on X has gone viral for noting only 37.8 percent of Steam players have the achievement for defeating Mohg, a boss that must be beaten to access Shadow of the Erdtree.

Are you one of these people? Then don't delay!
</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There is an achievement on Steam for beating Mogh. Which the <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ELDENRING</a> devs have said you have to beat  for the DLC. 37.8% of Steam players have this achievement. </p><p>This means that 62.2% of Steam players that have Elden Ring...</p><p>Will not be able to play the DLC! 🤣</p></div>— Cohh Carnage (@CohhCarnage) <a href="https://twitter.com/CohhCarnage/status/1800313422535364790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
As FromSoftware has previously stated, in order to access Shadow of the Erdtree players will need to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-starscourge-radahn-tips-strategy-8042">Starscourge Radahn</a></li>
<li>Defeat <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-beat-mohg-lord-of-blood-elden-ring-8042">Mohg Lord of Blood</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
From there, players will access the expansion by interacting with the ominous withered hand of Miquella protruding from the egg in the Mohg battle arena.
</p>
<p>
But is there anything else you should do to prepare?
</p>
<p>
Firstly, we've got the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date-preload-file-size-9415">Shadow of the Erdtree preload times and file sizes</a>, so make sure you've got enough space on your hard drive. You can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-system-requirements-9415">check the system requirements if you're on PC</a> to make sure your rig meets the minimum.
</p>
<p>
Now is also a good time to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-classes-best-class-starting-choice-8042">optimise your build</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-best-weapons-twinblade-8042">choose the best weapons</a>. Shadow of the Erdtree is set to offer a high level of challenge, so get practising and level up your character and favourite weapons. You should also spend some time deciding what to wear, because you'll want to look your best for Messmer.
</p>
<p>
You'll want <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-best-talismans-more-slots-8042">the best talismans</a> too to get the most out of your build, plus there's an achievement attached to the legendary talismans.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, items like your flasks will carry over, so make sure you've collected enough <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-golden-seeds-locations-8042">Golden Seeds</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sacred-tear-locations-8042">Sacred Tears</a> to level up your flasks to maximum potency.
</p>
<p>
With that you'll be all set to explore the Land of Shadow on 21st June!

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> features a far more fleshed out romance and relationship system than in previous BioWare games, the developer has told Eurogamer - including the ability for party members to go off and find their own love interests, should you not be interested yourself. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris Tapsell at an event in LA this week, The Veilguard's creative director John Epler revealed more of the game's relationship system.
</p>
<p>
"In Dragon Age games, BioWare games, romance is a core part," Epler said. "We wanted to give each character their own flavour, or their own style, of romance. So some characters may be a little more steamy while some characters maybe a little bit more innocent. But for each one, you can build these relationships.

<p>
"And what's interesting in this game is, if you don't romance characters, they may decide to find their own romances for themselves, whether within the team or within the world itself."
</p>
<p>It's reminiscent somewhat of how Shepard could walk in on Garrus and Tali locked in a kiss towards the end of Mass Effect 3 - but only if you had chosen not to show romantic interest in either one beforehand.</p>
<p>
What sounds like another improvement from previous BioWare games is how a character's romance arc will be better woven into their own personal story arc, and their involvement with The Veilguard's core questline. BioWare has also worked to ensure that getting to know your characters as friends feels just as satisfying - and that just because you're not banging your buddy, their (platonic) relationship with you will still continue.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
"One of the things we tried to do with The Veilguard is it's not just romantic relationship building," Epler continued. "You need to get to know a person before you can really build that kind of relationship with them, and if you choose not to build a [romantic] relationship, we never want to feel like you're being cut off. There's no 'okay, well, their arc isn't progressing, I'm done'. 
</p>
<p>
"We want to make sure the non-romantic relationships are deep as well, with friendships not just for companions and yourself, but also between companions across the party."

            <p>Nintendo has released an update for its Switch consoles, removing support for social media platform X in the process.</p>
<p>We knew this day was coming, with the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-x-support-from-switch">previously announcing its plans to pull support for X</a> last month.</p>
<p>While the company has not provided a reason for this change, Nintendo follows both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-dropping-playstation-5-and-ps4-twitter-integration-next-week">PlayStation and Xbox in removing integration with the social media network</a> since X changed its API pricing in March last year.</p>

But after three games spanning almost two decades, all I really wanted out of the next <em>Dragon Age</em> was a skin tone that matched mine <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-of-returning-to-dragon-1844909473">and didn’t look like I’d never seen a bottle of moisturizer</a>.</p><p>So I know there is a <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Maker">Maker</a> who loves me when one of the very first features that game director Corinne Busche showed me was all the different skin tones in <em>Veilguard</em>’s character creator.</p><p>“We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about skin tone,” she said. In the character creator, once you choose a race and customize your features — including the series-first ability to change your body size — you can check your work under different kinds of lighting. The character we made, a Black elf, seemed to glow in the bluish light of a nighttime scene, and under bright sunlight, I could see the richness of his color.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about skin tone.”</p></div><p>“We want to make sure that skin tone is reflected authentically,” Busche said.</p><p>The second feature I saw — one that I insisted Busche show me, risking the precious little time I had with this hands-off demo at Summer Game Fest — was the hair options.</p><p>“We have dozens and dozens of hair types,” she said. “And they’re fully affected by physics.” The quality and variety of choices I saw delighted me. The rows of bouncy, luxurious-looking hair of all curl types and textures (and yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/killmonger-cut-everywhere-games-spider-man-tekken-8">the annoyingly ubiquitous “Killmonger cut”</a> was among the options, what can you do?) brought the biggest smile to my face in the hour I spent with Busche and <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“A very important part of our philosophy is that no matter who you are, you’re able to realize yourself inside of this game,” Busche said, and I think they nailed it.</p><p>There was only so much I could see in the hour I had with the hands-off demo, but all of it was really heartening as a longtime <em>Dragon Age</em> fan. <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Minrathous?so=search">Minrathous</a>, the city we explored in the demo, was dark and moody, with its blood mage cultists, yet awash with the color of magical signs like the neon lights of a major city.</p><p>To some, that colorfulness, combined with <a href="https://youtu.be/drVOCrvXHhE?si=N7fny-Lwo3r8hR2t">a reveal trailer</a> that had a more stylized art direction, led to grumblings on social media that <em>The Veilguard</em> didn’t feel like a “real” <em>Dragon Age</em> game. Detractors complain that the new stylization looks too cartoonish and is too much a departure from the series that once featured Marilyn Manson’s “This Is the New Shit” <a href="https://youtu.be/6SuJ5T9sfAA?si=u66B6ZL1zfpqg_ek">in one of its blood-splattered trailers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Busche understood the criticisms and offered a two-pronged explanation. The first part was simply that <em>Dragon Age,</em> as a series, has always changed. “What we’ve seen over the years is an evolution of the visuals in the franchise,” Busche said. “<em>Dragon Age</em> has never really had an ownable visual identity.”</p><p>Busche explained that the team wanted to give players a game where locations were imbued with just as much personality as the characters. “That meant making contrast from the areas that are dark and decaying to the areas that are illuminated with magic,” Busche said.&nbsp;</p><p>Another reason <em>The Veilguard</em> looks so different from other <em>Dragon Age</em> games is because the locations themselves are unlike anything the franchise has seen before. The first three <em>Dragon Age</em> games took place in the southern parts of the world, where magic and its users were brutally repressed.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, for the locations in <em>Veilguard</em>, “This is a part of the world where magic has been embraced,” Busche said. “It is a society of mages and magic in this world is inherently colorful. So whether we’re seeing them use magic for everyday purposes like signage or using them as spells, that color really comes through.”</p><div><p>It’s been a long and possibly agonizing time coming for fans of the series who first got a glimpse of the new game back when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18126070/dragon-age-4-trailer-teaser-ea-announcement-release-date-game-awards-2018">it was announced at the 2018 Game Awards</a>. In the intervening years, there were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22947737/bioware-dragon-age-4-production-update">a few “proof of life” updates</a>, including the news that the game had undergone a massive change of scope with BioWare <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301634/dragon-age-single-player-only-ea-bioware-shifts">scrapping plans to add live-service multiplayer elements</a> to instead focus on a single-player-only experience.</p></div><p>But while that information was generally met with enthusiasm, optimism concerning the game’s future was imperiled by constant news of layoffs and high-profile departures. After decades with the studio, BioWare general manager Casey Hudson and <em>Dragon Age </em>executive producer Mark Darrah <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">left the company in 2020</a>. Creative director Matt Goldman <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801037/dragon-age-4-matt-goldman-bioware-ea">left in 2021</a>, 19-year BioWare veteran <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/23/23567676/bioware-mass-effect-mac-walters-dragon-age-dreadwolf">Mac Walters left in 2023</a>, and in that same year, the studio announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843096/bioware-layoffs-dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect">the layoffs of over 50 people</a>, including several long-serving BioWare employees.</p><p>Needless to say, <em>Veilguard</em>’s development has been beset by issues. And an hour of hands-off gameplay isn’t enough to completely dispel the lingering concerns that the game’s tortured development cycle has affected its quality. But I know the <em>Dragon Age</em> series, and based on the conversations I’ve had and the&nbsp;little I’ve seen, it feels like despite the turmoil, BioWare still got it right.</p><p>Final judgment will have to be reserved for when I can finally play the finished product when <em>Veilguard</em> launches in the fall of this year. But seeing all the character creator options, knowing that we’ll finally get a romanceable dwarf companion, and knowing that we’ll finally visit places like Weisshaupt and the necropolis of Nevarra — requests and locations that have dominated <em>Dragon Age</em> fandom discussions for decades — <em>Veilguard </em>feels like it’s on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, Kai checked out a behind-closed-doors media presentation of Dragon Age: The Veilguard; you can read his report <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-summer-game-fest-presentation-impressions-back-in-thedas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Today, BioWare is sharing the first 15-minute gameplay video with everyone, and they've also sent a fact sheet that clarifies several details and features of the upcoming action RPG.</p>
<p>Let's start with the first juicy details on the storyline of the fourth mainline installment in the franchise. As everyone who played Dragon Age: Inquisition and its DLCs already knows, Solas, companion to the Inquisitor player character during the previous game, is none other than the Elven trickster god of legend, also known more ominously as the Dread Wolf (the game's previous title). All along, his goal has been to tear down the Veil between the world of Thedas and the demon world to restore the ancient elven glory and immortality, and he doesn't care in the slightest if that means everyone else's doom.</p>
<p>According to BioWare, Solas does manage to go through with his tearing ritual only to see it backfire due to the player character (named Rook)'s intervention, freeing two of Solas' most powerful and relentless adversaries among the elven gods. It will be up to Rook and the party to clean up their own mess and stop these god-like beings from ravaging Thedas, all the while fighting other menacing foes like Venatori Cultists, Demons of the Fade, Dark Spawn, and more.</p>

<p>As teased by BioWare a while ago, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will portray more of Thedas than ever before in the RPG series. Lore fans will be happy to know they'll visit the Rivain peninsula, the fortress of the Grey Wardens at Weisshaupt, the elven forest of Arlathan, the Tevinter capital of Minrathous, the Deep Roads, and more. Biomes will be as diverse as bustling cities, lush tropics, boreal forests, forbidding swamps, and the deepest dungeons. The titular Veilguard will assemble at the Lighthouse, the classic RPG-style place where you can rest and chat with companions at your leisure.</p>
<p>The developers also promised 'some of the most compelling individual storylines' in the franchise history, which is an ambitious target given that this was always one of the strengths of Dragon Age and BioWare games as a whole. The seven companions (Veil Jumper Bellara, Grey Warden Davrin, Necromancer Emmrich, returning Scout Harding, Mage Killer Lucanis, Detective Neve, and Dragon Hunter Taash) will provide expansive and dynamic stories exploring love and loss, and player choices will affect both your relationship with the individual companions and with the whole group. Each companion comes with their own individual skill tree and specialized gear.</p>
<p>Finally, going back to the player character Rook, players will get the most powerful character creator in the franchise yet with a vast range of customization options. As you can see from the gallery above, you can select other races as well, such as elf or Qunari. You'll also be able to <a href="https://x.com/JackdawYT/status/1800249581361406392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose a starting faction</a> as part of the character's background. There will be six choices in this area, including Grey Wardens, Shadow Dragons, and Antivan Crows. In terms of character progression, players will be able to customize their playstyle through skill trees for three different classes: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue. As previously rumored, there won't be any direct control of the other two members of the party, but the ability wheel allows players to perform specific skills against any given target.</p>

<p>In a very brief post-presentation roundtable Q&amp;A at Summer Game Fest 2024, BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard would feature a 'tremendous amount of side content' that is entirely handcrafted rather than randomly generated in any way.</p>
<p>The game doesn't have a concrete release date yet other than a generic Fall 2024 window. It will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No longer focused on Dread Wolf</a> (Solas’ pet name, as players learn early on in this upcoming story), Bioware has returned to their storied RPG franchise with Dragon Age: The Veilguard. In one of the first semi-public demonstrations, Wccftech recently sat in on a behind-closed-door experience to take a peek at the character creation and initial story beats to the Veilguard.</span></p>
<p><span>As is typical for Dragon Age heroes, players first begin by picking their primary class between the assortment of Rogue, Warrior and Mage. From there, players dig into specializations that make each class feel specialized. For the Rogue that was shown off during our presentation for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, there were choices between a Duelist (parries and flourishes), Saboteur (explosives and turrets), and Veil Ranger (archery and magic). As the demo MC discussed at length, each specialization offers extensive skill trees to fit a player’s individual playstyle while also building towards unique synergies between both Rook and companions. After deciding on a lot in life, players then pick one of six factions to build out the backstory from before The Veilguard’s opening acts. Of the six factions, only five were discussed during our session: Grey Wardens, Veil Jumpers, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and the Shadow Dragons, the last of which was the faction of choice and lent to the main character’s last name. Two perks from opting to ally with the Shadow Dragons increase damages inflicted against the Venatori while also increasing the rate at which the Rogue’s class resource fills up.</span></p>
<p><span>The crux of the opening act to Dragon Age: The Veilguard is to stop Dreadwolf (again, Solas) from completing a ritual that would tear open the Veil and unleash daemonic foes upon the world. Minrathous, the capital city of the Tevinter Imperium, sets the stage for the prologue and the introduction to a world still populated by the likes of Varric (albeit a bit more grizzled and worn out). It’s a city that’s shown to be bustling “in a way never seen before” in a Dragon Age title, while the destruction wrought by demons introduces dynamic city destruction and set pieces.</span></p>

<p><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard opens with the lead character of Rook heading into the seediest bar in Minrathous to seek out a missing contact, Neve Gallus. It’s here that players are introduced to the dialogue systems at play in Dragon Age and only a couple of dialogue options. Rather than presenting the outcome and consequence of one’s words, the dialogue wheel instead simply states what the main character will do, putting players into the seat of more immersive role-playing. Returning to the conversation are a multitude of dialogue options, from the affable and tough to the irreverent and snarky.</span></p>
<p><span>For the main focus of the showcase, BioWare wanted to show off the combat in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Billed as a fusion between moment-to-moment action and strategy, players will get to experience some of the fastest action combat that’s been seen in a Dragon Age title. Fighting takes a few notes from popular open-world action game with parry indications and a form of Spidey Sense that highlights when enemies are about to hit Rook and also indications for ranged attacks from afar. For players who are less comfortable engaging with the action combat, there are a number of modifiers that can be tweaked including increasing the parry indicators, or simply removing them entirely for increased difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span>While there is a focus on the action in The Veilguard, it wouldn’t be a Dragon Age title without implementing a form of Real Time with Pause to the strategy. Players will have access to 9 slots for abilities that can be toggled during these pause segments and ally abilities can be slotted in as well as player abilities to create synergies between followers. One such combo that was recommended was to cast a spell that would slow down time to synergize with another mage that could cast a damage-over-time spell.</span></p>
<p><span>BioWare touched just briefly on the companion stories but wanted to emphasize that one of the core pillars of Dragon Age was to inspire a team of unforgettable companions. Each of the seven companions (Harding, Neve, Taash, Emmrich, Davrin, Lucanis, and Bellara) has a story arc that runs parallel to the main campaign but can be skipped by players who don’t wish to get too emotionally invested in that character’s plight. The Veilguard also continues the trend of integrating side characters from the previous game as a full companion. In this instance, Scout Harding is now a proper member of The Veilguard and it’s been a full ten years since the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition.</span></p>

<p><span>For the most part, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is feature complete and the development team is currently in the midst of bug fixing when we spoke with them during Summer Game Fest 2024. This introductory mission brought technologies and ancient enemies from the Dragon Age mythos to the forefront, and our mission director talked about wanting to make the prologue feel like the final mission of another game so that players could get stakes in the action as quickly as possible. In just a matter of thirty minutes, players progressed from a bare-knuckle brawl in a local tavern to a near-apocalyptic event with Solas trying to tear the literal fabric of space and time before disappearing into a portal wrought open with two yet-unnamed folks. </span></p>
<p><span>Are they on par with an Elven god like Solas? Only time will tell! Meanwhile, check out the first 15-minute gameplay video and some extra details from BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this article.</a></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-is-strange-beautiful-twist-of-genres<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom, though more well-known for its monolithic franchises such as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a>, </em>infrequently&nbsp;pivots and creates something entirely new -- something experimental.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is just that: a weird, one-of-a-kind game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>has a Style All its Own</h2>
<p>I had the chance to get hands-on with&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> at Summer Game Fest, and after roughly an hour of gameplay, it's most certainly a niche title, but it does have a lot of intriguing mechanics and, most of all, style.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>is a beauty -- its take on Japanese mythology makes for a psychedelic experience, with highly stylized visuals through its UI, character and monster design, and just about everything else.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the soundtrack for this game is of the highest caliber, making great use of traditional Japanese instruments. With day and night cycles in&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>, music is more calm during the day, but gradually ramps up as monsters emerge at night.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess </em>and its Genre Shift</h2>
<p>The day is spent gathering resources and eliciting the aid of villagers freed from a strange corruption -- called Seethe --spreading across the world of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>. You're able to gather resources by slashing certain plants and cleansing the area.</p>
<p>This whole sequence is not unlike a strategy game a la&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/age-of-empires"><i>Age of Empires</i></a>; certainly,&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>&nbsp;is on a much smaller scale, but gathering resources to create units you can command in battle? That's a staple of the genre.</p>

<p>Though,&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>&nbsp;does plenty to deviate from the norm; the areas you can explore are from a third-person perspective, just like any other character from a hack-and-slash game. That's fitting, then, that during the night, we get a total shift of genre.</p>
<p>Emerging from the corrupted torii gates are monsters from the Seethe, and you have to slay them to protect the maiden Yoshiro, as she is the means by which you can cleanse these corrupted gates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players control their units and position them in such a way that they fight off any monsters emerging from the gate, though said units aren't nearly as powerful as the player character, Soh. He is a killing machine, and has one helluva fighting style.</p>
<p>Soh melds swordplay with dancing, creating dazzling displays as he hacks and slashes his way through enemies. Inputs for Soh's attacks aren't unlike a&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warrior&nbsp;</em>game, using simple two-button combos to pull off elaborate attacks.</p>
<p>While the combat is is fun, the waves of enemies tend to drag on. Commanding units amounts to positioning them in certain spots, and that's it -- it's lacking in complexity. Slashing through monsters as Soh felt a bit too easy, and the gameplay grew repetitive over time.</p>

<h2>But Will <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> Live up to its Potential?</h2>
<p>That's not to say&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami</em>&nbsp;won't expand upon its mechanics. I do see some potential in the inclusion of skills, as well as upgrades that alter characteristics of Soh or his units. There was even a boss battle, though it turned out to be a sponge for damage, nothing more.</p>
<p>There also appears to be a great deal of different units, though I only saw a handful. They seem to stick to specific archetypes, like archer, but who knows? Maybe they'll become more elaborate as time goes on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And of course, day tasks are sure to expand as time goes on -- in a later level, I had options to clear rubble to gain an upgrade, or repair a gate that'll stop monsters in their path. <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>might end up being a slow burn, but it has potential.</p>
<p>If I left my demo with any feeling, it's one of cautious optimism. The mishmash of genres and its third-person, action game perspective is rare in this day and age, but if anyone can pull it off, it's Capcom.&nbsp;</p>
