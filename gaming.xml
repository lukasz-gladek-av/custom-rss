That’s well below the Backbone One’s $100 MSRP and its typical sale price of $69.99.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile doesn’t connect via a USB-C or Lightning port like other mobile options. Instead, it uses Bluetooth for wireless compatibility with most smartphones running Android 9.0 or later. (Sorry, iPhone users!) That does mean you’ll need to recharge it occasionally, but 8BitDo says it only requires a 1.5-hour charge for 15 hours of gameplay. It can also accommodate any phone measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length.</p><p>In terms of hardware, 8BitDo’s mobile gamepad offers an Xbox-style button layout and ergonomics, with four face buttons, a clicky D-pad, dual bumpers, and drift-free Hall effect sticks and triggers that should be less prone to failure over time. It also features two rear buttons, a dedicated profile button, and turbo functionality, all of which are customizable with 8BitDo’s excellent Ultimate Software.</p><div><p>8BitDo’s mobile gamepad offers an Xbox-style grip and compatibility with phones running Android 9.0 or later.

            <p>Destiny creators Bungie are reportedly making a team-based MOBA that takes hefty inspiration from Nintendo's Smash Bros series. Or rather, they were. Codenamed Gummy Bears, the project is now apparently in the hands of another, newly founded PlayStation studio, with 40 Bungie developers sticking around to work on it.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, who cite anonymous sources, the new Sony studio in question is the one founded last year when Bungie (who are owned by Sony) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">announced major restructuring</a>. Consisting of 155 people, the new studio were said back then to be working on an untitled "action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe".</p>
<p>The Gummy Bear project is described as "vibrant", "colourful", "lo-fi", and "cosy". Perhaps needless to say, it's designed for a younger audience. The Game Post's sources claim it's been in development for three years, and uses a percentage-based damage system, where blows knock back characters further and further, rather than traditional health bars. Which is very Smash Bros.</p>
<p>It's also said to have three class types - support, attack and defence - and a bunch of modes, with the ability to hang out with people between matches. Which I guess implies that there's a hub environment of some kind. Less excited about that stuff. I hate hanging out. Leave me alone.</p><p>Bungie's known projects include the Destiny series and a reboot of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> - aged cousin of DOOM turned PvP extraction shooter. Bitter old farts like myself and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">Brendy</a> do not think much of nu-Marathon, whose workings remain a mystery almost two years on from announcement. But galloping guides editor Ollie is rather more optimistic. In our round-up of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">2025's most anticipated games</a>, he comments that "I adore extraction shooters, and despite the continued dominance of Tarkov and Hunt, Bungie has the potential to create the genre's new frontrunner".</p>
<p>Me, I'd rather play a Bungie Smash Bros homage. I mean, Bungie are the people who invented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zejmZGaonLY">the Gravity Hammer</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The latest Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 has completely broken matchmaking, with players reporting they cannot get into the game.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Activision has yet to offer an update or patch notes for both Black Ops 6 and Warzone, but currently, no one is seemingly able to play the game.</p>



<p>But don’t worry; the Call of Duty store works fine if you’re planning to spend some of your hard-earned cash.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://mobile.x.com/CODUpdates/status/1878856625920065848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates</a> X account, the current issues are a result of the update being distributed to everyone. </p>



<p>The latest patch update is Call of Duty Black Ops 6’s and Warzone’s first update since the Call of Duty development teams took leave for the holidays. As for what exactly the patch entailed, it remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been under fire in recent weeks due to the game’s massive number of bugs, inaccurate bans, and hackers, which has seen the game lose players on mass over the holiday period. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game lost 38.9 of its Steam player base in December, the highest percentage lost during this period in the past few years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SteamDB shows a further 20.8% loss during the past 30 days. Today’s news for Call of Duty keeps on getting worse, as earlier in the day, one leaker reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-is-reportedly-returning-to-warzone-in-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk will be returning during Season 3</a> rather than Season 2.</p>



<p>Waht do you think of Call of Duty’s latest blunders? Let us know down in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>According to new information revealed by a known leaker, Nintendo Switch 2 could be revealed this week with a new trailer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0fwdx/natethehate_nintendo_switch_2_will_be_revealed_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Nate the Hate has released a new video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> titled “Nintendo 2025 Predictions”. In it, he discusses when the Switch 2 will be revealed, what kind of support it will get, and other details. In the video, Nate states, “The Nintendo Switch 2 will be revealed in the coming week.” He has been told that the Switch 2 announcement trailer will arrive on Thursday, January 16.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate added that the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal will “focus almost exclusively on the console itself”. The reveal will not have any games present unless a game is shown “running on the screen”, depending on how the trailer comes out. He has explicitly stated that “software is not going to be a focus”, so players shouldn’t be “too surprised” if no games are revealed for the Nintendo Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nate elaborated that this week’s Nintendo Switch 2 reveal trailer might only showcase the system, its functionality, the new logo, and maybe some packaging. He’s heard that a separate software showcase for Switch 2 games will be scheduled for late February or early March, where we might see new Nintendo games and third-party titles.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Starfield was originally planned to have a gore and dismemberment system like Fallout, with players being able to more gruesomely kill foes. However, these features were ultimately left out of Starfield.</p><p>In an interview with Kiwi Talkz, former senior character artist Dennis Mejillones said that there were technical considerations when it came to the space suits. "There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off; you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is," he explained. "We had systems for all of that, and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for."</p><p>With the feature of being able to customize body size in the character creator, that added more complications. Mejillones also said that gore and dismemberment didn't fit with Starfield's themes as opposed to Fallout's over-the-top presentation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2697">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ebSmOGZnmeM?start=2697" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk where you can make a mess out of something and blow up? It's part of the fun," he explained.</p><p>He added that Starfield was meant to be more realistic, so gore and dismemberment didn't fit in thematically. With the technical costs factored in, it was decided that gore would be scrapped from the game.</p><p>Other former Starfield developers have shared their thoughts on the game and the industry at large. One said that they were surprised at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-starfield-dev-surprised-by-the-number-of-loading-screens-it-could-have-existed-without-those/1100-6528530/" data-ref-id="1100-6528530">number of loading screens</a> Starfield had, and another Bethesda veteran said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-veteran-says-players-are-fatigued-by-seemingly-endless-games/1100-6528653/" data-ref-id="1100-6528653">players are fatigued by long games</a>.</p><p>Starfield is currently on PC and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-journey-worth-taking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Heart Machine gained worldwide fame for its stellar debut title, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hyper-light-drifter" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a>. Its mysterious world filled with vibrant ruins and dangerous foes is making the transition to 3D in the upcoming follow-up, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/heart-machine" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>.</p>

<p>I had a chance to play <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> at Summer Game Fest Play Days <a rel="nofollow">earlier this year</a>, and I called it your "next roguelite addiction." I still agree with that sentiment, perhaps even more so now that I had a chance to try out a co-op session with two other players.</p>



<h2>Lootin', Shootin', and Slashin' in Hyper Light Breaker</h2>

<p>So I don't end up retreading old territory, be sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hyper-light-breaker-preview-your-next-roguelite-addiction" rel="nofollow">my preview</a> from June. I'll give the basics of <em>Hyper Lift Breaker</em>'s gameplay before I dive into some new thoughts from my cooperative session. It is, of course, <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/roguelite" rel="nofollow">a roguelite</a>, so all the mechanics we expect from such a genre (metaprogression, random generation, tough difficulty, etc..) are there.</p>

<p>With a range of melee weaponry from swift striking claws to a one-handed sword, and guns from an electric shotgun to a large beam cannon, playstyles will differ vastly based on your kit. There's a lot of different weapons and I didn't have nearly enough time to try them out, but there's sure to be a great deal of variety for players.</p>

<p>The fact that <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> drops in Early Access means there's going to be even more weapons, upgrades, and characters to play, so we're only seeing the beginning of things. Right now, players will be satisfied with the loot they might come across as they explore the large, randomly generated environments.</p>



<h2>Scouring the Ruins <em>of Hyper Light Breaker</em></h2>

<p>Speaking of environments, this is where <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> shines. The world I explored during this demo was different than the one I played earlier this year. With two experienced co-op buddies tagging along, I got a better idea of where to look for loot.</p>

<p>There's a large amount of verticality in <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>. In this vast, open map, ruins are scattered all over the environment and tower above the player. These ruins are massive, and a series of jump pads help players get to the top. My co-op partners explored every inch of these towers and we found loot tucked away, meaning a keen eye goes a long way.</p>



<p>It's quite marvelous to see just how high you can climb these ruins. At one point, we reached the top of a tower. There wasn't any loot, but I thought the scenery from being all the way at the top of the world was worth it. You could see various stunning landmarks, like a giant sword jutting out of the earth in the distance.</p>

<p>With a handy map, we chose our next destination and jumped off the tower. Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild-review-switching-things-up" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, you can use a glider to slow your descent and prevent fall damage. Indeed, it feels like <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> takes great inspiration from <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, with its open, almost directionless exploration and stamina meters.</p>



<h2><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And again, fun is multiplied when friends are along for the ride. I can just imagine myself and some buddies checking out our map, charting where we want to go next. Taking on a bunch of foes is also a bit less daunting when you have two other players by your side.</p>

<p>We collected some keys scattered around this large map and unlocked a boss fight. Teleporting into an arena, this fearsome boss spawned a bunch of minions and a frantic fight to the death ensued. Whether you're in <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> for its fast-paced, snappy combat or its grand exploration, you're bound to have fun.</p>

<p><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> received a delay earlier this year, which was sad to see. Nonetheless, developers don't delay a game lightly and I'm sure <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> is much better for it. Everything felt more polished from my first demo. Heart Machine is cooking up something special, and you won't have to wait long to play: <em>Hyper Light Breaker </em>launches in Early Access on January 14, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-vp-reveals-dungeons-dragons-2024-sales-and-digital-usage<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week we got to hear from Jeremy Crawford and Wes Schneider, Co-Leads for the 2024 <em>Monster Manual</em>, about what we can expect when the third part of the 2024 Core Rulebooks release in a little over a month. Before that though Jess Lanzillo, VP of Franchise and Product for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, walked us through 2024 as a year for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> including some interesting comparisons to the 2014 5th Edition release.</p>

<h2><em>D&amp;D</em> and D&amp;DBeyond in 2024</h2>

<p>Lanzillo began by discussing the way Wizards of the Coast have been tracking the sales for the 2024 Core Rulebooks released so far; the <em>Player's Handbook</em> in September 2024 and the <em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em> in November 2024. In the past four months these two books have already sold as many copies as it took the 2014 edition three years to meet including all language versions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can check out our reviews for the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow"><em>Player's Handboo</em></a>k and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeon Master's Guide</em></a>, and be sure to look out for a review of the Monster Manual before too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lanzillo expressed that now that the final Core Book is almost released they're looking forward to 'finally beginning'.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We're going to have this really nice base of what's going to be setting up <em>D&amp;D</em> for the future. [...] It's going to be a springboard for all of the exciting stuff that we are going to be doing in the future."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After discussing that Wizards of the Coast was happy with the engagement in the new Core Rulebooks Lanzillo discussed some other milestones that they were seeing across other D&amp;D related platforms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ddbeyond-vtt.jpg?itok=_cTYeCIf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ddbeyond-vtt.jpg?itok=85vBlW6B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For D&amp;DBeyond she was able to reveal that over 3.6 million characters have been made on D&amp;DBeyond with the 2024 ruleset, there are over 19 million registered users on D&amp;DBeyond, and that 1.3 million maps have been used in the D&amp;DBeyond VTT (This is not including the new 3D VTT that we know is on the way).</p>

<p>Lanzillo bookmarked all of the statements about <em>D&amp;D</em> and D&amp;DBeyond by mentioning that all of these milestones also don't include all of those who are playing the game completely physically.</p>

<h2>The Greater <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Brand</h2>

<p>Talking about <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> outside of the Tabletop experience Lanzillo brought up the continued success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2158b818-8ae7-45f2-997e-44a5977e48f4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldurs Gate III</em></a> which continues to be in the top 10 most played games on Steam and regularly breaks into 100K+ concurrent players. There was also mention of continued support from Larian into 2025 with new sub-class options.</p>

<p>Finally to wrap up the discussion on the D&amp;D Brand Lanzillo was able to reveal that in 2024 around 85 million fans have engaged in D&amp;D across movies, video games, merchandise purchases, or just by playing the game.</p>

		<p>It's game of the year week! When Rob and I were reflecting on last year's game of the year pods, we had two thoughts. One, we really enjoyed the round robin format, where we only meaningfully discuss a video game when we've reached its status at the top of someone's top ten list. It prevented the issue I've encountered on other game of the year discussions, where you say everything there is to say before, inevitably, the game in question is someone's favorite from the year. Two, we both ended up playing games over the break that would've ended up in our game of the year list, but because we recorded in December, they weren't part of it. So this year, we decided to punt the discussions until January, and given how my list is shaping up, it was a very good decision to keep the conversation until then.</p><p>-pk, who is curious about this buzzy new game, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em></p><hr><figure></figure><p><em>Attention: We're recording a new Remap Hotline.

Eggman’s loyal-to-a-fault henchman has been a consistent supporting character through all three movies thus far, and <em>Sonic 3 </em>pretty much solidified what had become a long-running fan joke and theory since the first movie premiered in 2020: Agent Stone is absolutely in love with Jim Carrey’s Eggman, and these movies are slow burn toxic yaoi.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="183" data-playlist="194842,196790,195905" data-current="194842"><div><p>The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20305.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Sonic 3 </em>presents easily the most emotionally charged version of Agent Stone’s love for Eggman, this guy has been self-destructively devoted to the mad scientist since day one. My god, is it toxic. In the first film, Carrey’s version of Eggman was defined by a mostly grounded superiority complex He’s just a dick to everyone, and that includes Stone. However, Stone’s undying loyalty means he takes it all on the chin, and the dom/sub undertones are not subtle. There’s a scene in which Eggman puts his hand in Stone’s mouth and pulls him close to whisper sweet nothings (unbridled abuse) into his ear. Later, he makes Stone pin himself to a wall as he once again hurls not-so-niceties his way, and the imagery is enough to make even people who are watching the scenes out of context blush.</p><p>It was with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>that the movies dropped any notion of subtlety about how Agent Stone feels about the doctor. After Eggman is jettisoned onto a different planet at the end of the first movie, Stone opens up a coffee shop like a sad widower still hoping to see his husband return from the war. His first scene in the movie has him making latte art of himself and his ex-boss with hearts coming out of it. Gay. We later see more of Stone putting up with abuse, but my guy seems to be enjoying every second of it and still sticks with Eggman through another defeat at the hands of Sonic. By the time <em>Sonic 3 </em>is ready to finally address the abusive elephant in the room, it is some of the angstiest shit in a movie that has Keanu Reeves as a brooding, revenge-driven hedgehog.</p><p>In between all the pop culture references and needle drops, <em>Sonic 3 </em>is probably the most raw of all three movies, and that extends to Stone and Eggman’s relationship. Stone has become a capable protector for his superior, who has entered a deep depression after losing to Sonic last time. But when the doctor meets his grandfather, who seemingly replaces Stone as the most important person in his life, the agent is left abandoned as Eggman goes off to try and conquer the world without him. The “breakup” includes a painful phone call in which Stone pleads with Eggman to come back, saying that he’s not there to protect him from whatever his grandfather is planning and that he “can’t lose [him] again.” I turned to my siblings in the theater to remark about how gay it was. But it all comes to a bittersweet end as Eggman apologizes on a worldwide broadcast just before his apparent death while Stone helplessly watches with the saddest puppy-dog eyes to grace a theater screen. This is the tragic, toxic shit that terabytes of fanfiction and fan art are made of. After the events of <em>Sonic 3</em>, all the long-time Stobonik shippers are having a field day with edits and fanart, and new fans are realizing what they’ve been missing.</p><p>Given Eggman’s supposed death, it’s unclear if Agent Stone will have any role in the next <em>Sonic </em>movie coming in 2027. However, given the character’s popularity, it would be a shame to have one of the few human characters fans seem to universally love go away just as he’s finding himself. Fans are already hoping that Majdoub could return as Stone in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Shadow spin-off</a></span> as the two had some rapport in <em>Sonic 3</em>.

The suggestion already has fans running with ideas and jokes.</p><p>While the future of Eggman and Stone is uncertain, one thing that is certain is that Majdoub approves of the Stobotnik ship. Here he is endorsing the pairing and saying that “toxic yaoi’s the shit.” So true, bestie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The movie tells the story of the pop singer and his rise to fame, but replaces him with a digital monkey.

The movie focuses on Robbie Williams, a British pop star who found fame overseas in the band Take That, before going on to have a successful solo career. But instead of a human actor playing Williams, <em>Better Man</em> features a CGI chimpanzee. Nobody in the movie comments about the fact that an ape is front of them, so its likely just an artistic metaphor inspired by Williams stating that he’s always been “less evolved than other people.” And this weird concept seems to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apnews.com/article/box-office-den-thieves-better-man-mufasa-3a702f5b216ef7268adf0e5be6a0e1e3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apnews.com/article/box-office-den-thieves-better-man-mufasa-3a702f5b216ef7268adf0e5be6a0e1e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-den-of-thieves-2-first-place-robbie-williams-biopic-better-man-bombs-1236272480/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-den-of-thieves-2-first-place-robbie-williams-biopic-better-man-bombs-1236272480/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Variety </em>on January 12</a></span>, <em>Better Man</em> opened in the United States at number 14.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-balatro-have-cross-save-or-cross-progression/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Balatro having cross-progression or cross-save would mean you can play the roguelike on any platform, save your data, and resume your progress on another format. Many games utilize a similar infrastructure, but a lesser indie title like Balatro isn’t guaranteed to use this.</p>



<p>Developer LocalThunk’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Game of the Year</a> card game has an easy premise. You battle through several rounds (Antes), needing to score enough points to advance from Blind to Blind. Each new run sees you use different Jokers and utilize a variety of upgrades. The sense of progression comes when you unlock new Decks—such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-plasma-deck-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plasma Deck</a>—and new Jokers: I’m looking at you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-hit-the-road-joker-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hit The Road</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-brainstorm-joker-in-balatro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brainstorm</a>.</p>



<p>Unlocking new content makes future runs more fun. However, say you’re playing PS5, and want to start on Mobile, cross-progression is handy. Let’s tell you</p>



<p> everything we know about a cross-save system and its status.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-balatro-have-cross-progression">Does Balatro Have Cross-Progression? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Losing progress sucks. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Balatro currently does not incorporate any type of cross-save or cross-progression functionality.</strong></p>



<p>The game’s <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official FAQ</a> features a question titled, “Can I carry my game progress over from another platform?” If you open up this query, it explains “<strong>At this time, it’s not possible to transfer your profile from another platform to mobile.”</strong></p>



<p>It doesn’t matter if you’re on PlayStation, Xbox, PC, or Nintendo Switch, your Balatro progress has to stay on one platform. I find this disappointing as I can’t bring myself to start a whole new save file when I have so many hours invested on PS5.</p>



<p>You don’t need to feel downhearted as it doesn’t look like it’ll stay like this forever.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-balatro-get-cross-save-or-cross-progression">Will Balatro Get Cross-Save or Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>Developer LocalThunk has confirmed cross-progression and/or cross-save <strong>“is on the roadmap for future updates.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, using the FAQ as a reference point, when discussing game progress, a future patch is looking to bring cross-progression in. Unfortunately, we can’t find a timeframe for this yet, meaning it could be in the next update, or a few months from now.</p>



<p>I for one am desperate to see this included. Once cross-save is a thing, I’ll be happy to sink hours into Balatro via my phone. A final, tense run before bed is the perfect remedy to help me sleep, right?</p>



<p>Keep checking back as we look to bring you an update on this feature being added.</p>



<hr>



<p>Will cross-progression’s planned addition encourage you to pick up Balatro on more platforms? Could this be a feature to catapult Balatro into the stars and cement itself as an inclusive roguelike catering to its die-hard community?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The long-rumored&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake is apparently very real indeed, and it'll pack plenty of visual and gameplay improvements, including changes to combat, the HUD, various gameplay systems, and more.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-real-gameplay-improvement-details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP1st report</a> (which cites "a mistake made" by an ex-employee of support studio Virtuos), the remake of&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&nbsp;</em>will be built in Unreal Engine 5 and that it'll be a full remake rather than a simple remaster.</p>

<p>Supposedly, the website includes information regarding changes to certain gameplay systems. Blocking, for instance, will be more heavily inspired by Soulslike games thanks to the "boring" nature of shield-based combat in the original&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, and sneaking will also be improved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-shield.jpg?itok=Xmh9t8-d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-shield.jpg?itok=y9W5Mlgd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will apparently make a number of changes to the original game's systems.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes include a reworked stamina system that MP1st says will be less "frustrating" for players, as well as a new HUD that's "easier to understand and more aesthetically appealing to young players" (again, that's MP1st's wording, not the Virtuos employee's).</p>

<p>If you're wondering whether the unannounced project that's set to be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct event</a> is the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, MP1st says that's not the case, so don't expect a Bethesda announcement during that showcase.</p>

<p>However, as the MP1st report points out, rumors had already begun to swirl about an&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake potentially launching in June courtesy of insider <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-release-date-june-2025-rumour/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">NateTheHate</a>, so if those rumors are correct, Microsoft likely won't want to wait too long to announce the project.</p>

<p>As ever, since there's no first-party source for this information, you should take it with a pinch of salt, but hopefully, we'll hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-cave.jpg?itok=WVZTx-lm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-report-cave.jpg?itok=o24ZABRy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake be announced soon? Let's hope so.</figcaption></figure><p>If you somehow haven't heard of&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, it's the fourth mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>series. Released in 2006, it's the precursor to the phenomenally popular&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>&nbsp;and the followup to the cult hit&nbsp;<em>Morrowind</em>.</p>

<p>A sixth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game is in development at Bethesda right now, although it's been a very long time indeed since the project's official announcement. It is, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-vi-after-2026-no-ps5" rel="nofollow">according to an internal Microsoft document</a>, set for release in "2026 or later".</p>

            <p>In 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/airborne-kingdom">Airborne Kingdom</a>, you cobbled together a flying city from sailcloth, smokestacks, wings and flippers, striving to meet a growing population's need for food and shelter while dealing with the more exotic problem of levelling your streets out and generating enough lift. In the process, you explored a beautiful, Orientalist world map of faded mosaic tiles and dusty gold fittings. </p>
<p>In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/airborne-empire">Airborne Empire</a>, out in early access today, you do much the same again, but this time the world is trying to murder you. A bit. You are no longer alone in the skies: there are merchant dirigibles you can barter with, and pirate airships who'll strafe your suburbs and set your bazaars on fire. As such, the sequel's new city technologies include a choice of offensive and defensive weapons. Here's a launch trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb from the creators.</p>
<blockquote>"While exploring a variety of biomes, players find themselves deep in an open-world full of rich characters, dialogue choices, side-quests, and lost marvels. By helping the peoples below, they gain the knowledge to develop new technologies - including new lift, propulsion, and morale buildings. They'll also gain access to better tools for defense - and offense - against the pirate threat; defense towers, cannons, and attack planes can be researched, upgraded, and augmented with the tools found by combing the world and unraveling its mysteries. With full systems for building upgrades, fires, sickness, injuries, light, morale, and augmentation relics, there is plenty of treasure to discover!" </blockquote>
<p>I liked the original Airborne Kingdom, but had reservations about the game never quite addressing the fact that it is pretty bloody sinister. The writing frames you as a benign presence, helping out ground-bound cities and offering a new way of life to wistful souls in remote villages, but the campaign progression and overall visual spectacle tell a different story. I mean, this is a game about about an empire with a mobile centre, a remorselessly expanding heavenly citadel that prowls and siphons resources from a pliant, balmy world of towns who, somehow, do not react in pure religious terror to having the sun periodically eclipsed by a dense, smoking mass of minarets and propellers.</p>
<p>Airborne Empire's addition of war mechanics consolidates this reading, on paper, though the writing seems as dreamy and upbeat as ever, with a newly zoomorphic cast of chirping, cawing, squawking avian NPCs.</p>
<p>I explored all this in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/airborne-kingdom-review-skybound-city-building-that-could-do-with-a-bit-more-gravity">a review for Eurogamer</a>, back when I was a cloud-hopping freelancer. Around the same time, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/airborne-kingdoms-arabesque-steampunk-is-an-absolute-delight">a more hopeful analysis</a> of the game as exploring and celebrating "the role of Islamic cultures in what we think of as the Renaissance", with a story and quests that trade on the recovery and continuity of knowledge during an age of scattering.</p><p>"From the arches and minarets of your sprawling waftopolis, to the scales the soundtrack breezes through, to the dream-like, abstract patterns which cover the opening region in place of an ocean, it's the golden age of medieval Islam writ large," he commented. I would love to read a longer piece on the topic from either Nate or another scholar of Islamic art.</p>
<p>The early access launch version of Airborne Empire is, by the developer's own admission, "a bit bare-bones, lacking content and polish". It features building and research, the lift and balance mechanics, city movement, and NPC dialogue. Over the course of an estimated year in early access, the Wandering Bard will "add new building types, new biomes, new events/missions and expand the background story of the game". They'll also do testing and QA, stir in Steam features such as achievements, and incorporate player feedback. </p>
<p>At the risk of making a mockery of my own gloomy sentiments about blithe imperialism, I have an itch to see how multiplayer would work in a game like this. Or at least, city-vs-city combat. Presumably, choice of layout would be decisive. I can imagine wreaking havoc at the helm of a burg that consists of a huge crescent with turrets pointing inward. Pac-City, we'd call ourselves. Anyway, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2438680/Airborne_Empire/">find Airborne Empire on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo is expected to finally unveil <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> in just a matter of days. 
</p>
<p>
Industry whispers Eurogamer has heard over the past week have coalesced around a reveal this Thursday, 16th January, with a focus on the much-leaked console itself, rather than a deep dive into its software line-up.
</p>
<p>
Today, these whispers were first mentioned publicly by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWifbMkXe_4&amp;ab_channel=NatetheHate">Nate the Hate</a> podcast, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">previously leaked Microsoft's multiplatform publishing plans</a>. Writing on social media, The Verge's <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217">Tom Warren</a> confirmed he also understood Nintendo planned to reveal Switch 2 this week.

<p>
While Nintendo is yet to announce anything, and announcement plans are always subject to change, the growing sense that this week is - finally - the week we officially see Switch 2 for the first time fits with what Eurogamer has previously heard of Nintendo's announcement timing. 
</p><p>
Eurogamer has tracked Switch 2's road to release over the past few years and exclusively reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">system's capabilities had been demoed to developers around Gamescom</a> in the summer of 2023. We believed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst">an early 2025 reveal was imminent</a>, as Nintendo sought to wring one last Christmas from Switch 1 but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">faced a ticking clock for when it would then reveal the console's successor</a> before its own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">self-imposed 31st March deadline</a> - and amidst a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-lawyers-visited-genki-to-discuss-those-switch-2-leaks-reporter-claims">growing ocean of leaks</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's reveal of the Switch 2 hardware, when it comes, will finally put paid to speculation around the console's form factor, before an expected full reveal of the its launch line-up at a later date, it's believed. 
</p>
<p>As for the console's actual launch, Eurogamer previously reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hopes-fade-for-switch-2-launch-in-early-2025">Switch 2 will not arrive before April</a>, following earlier plans that saw its arrival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">pushed to 2025 to ensure it arrived with the strongest launch line-up possible</a>.
</p>
<p>
An announcement this week also fits neatly after last week's industry focus on the CES trade show, and a week clear of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-announces-xbox-developer-direct">Microsoft's own Xbox Developer Direct</a>, on Thursday 23rd January.

			<p>What is life? It’s a simple question, yet it has been a cornerstone of philosophy and religion for as long as people have pondered existence. From this question, more arise, with debates carried out about the meaning of life as well as what we classify as life. Threefold Recital takes this fundamental question and makes it the centre of its experience. Threefold Recital is less a game about philosophy and more a philosophical journey in the guise of a game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Threefold Recital Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0MYx0Cb_xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Threefold Recital’s story finds it origin in a debate between a Daoist priest and Buddhist monk, which attracts the wild animals around them to listen. Three of these animals, a wolf, a fox, and a snake ponder this debate so much that they become Beastlings, which are humanoid versions of themselves.</p>


<p>As part of their change and affiliations, each has an ability. Triratna is the wolfling that became a Buddhist monk, and his powers are based upon karma. He can see karma lines which can be severed to remove obstacles, and affinity lines to see the relationship between people and items. Taiqing is the fox turned Daoist priest who can create items and travel through dimensions. Transia is the snake who becomes an artist, blessed with the ability to travel through paintings and to apply bodypaint so she can disguise herself as other characters.</p>
<p>These three characters live in the city of Bluescales, a place once ruled by nine or ten dragon emperors, depending on who you ask. However, most of these dragon emperors are now dead and Bluescales’ glory has faded with them. They all know each other, but for the majority of Threefold Recital each is on their own path dealing with their own quests including solving a murder and learning the secret of an old theatre. Much of the gameplay consists of speaking to different characters, interacting with items in the world, and solving puzzles.</p>


<p>Triratna’s path is the most hands-on in this regard due to the severing of karma lines. These puzzles consist of lines and knots that must be cut in order. They get harder as new line types are added, including fuse lines that will explode and reset some of the puzzle. The lines will also move around as you try to cut them. These puzzles become a lesson in patience, requiring you to focus on smaller elements to break the larger picture. Taiqing and Transia’s puzzles are more environmentally based, requiring you to figure out the way forward by finding specific items or talking with the right characters at the right time.</p>
<p>Threefold Recital incorporates a lot of religious and philosophy within its game design. The prologue is set at the end of the game which you circle back to eventually, echoing the concept of Samsara within Buddhism which is an endless circle of life and death with no fixed end or beginning. When Taiqing enters another dimension, it stands for the yin and yang of Daoism, switching between black and white to see and hear information. These pieces of information are almost never fully whole as they are only part of the circle. For Transia, much of her adventure deals with the question of life and what it really means. It posits questions such as are you alive if only a handful of people know you exist, or if you were put together instead of being born in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>Threefold Recital is a fun game that has enough variety in its puzzles that none become stale, from the severing of karma lines to donning the right disguise to gather information. The art style fits the narrative well, with art itself being another central theme to Threefold Recital. It has a kind of chibi style for its characters, but then there are artworks within that are inspired by East Asian styles. The soundtrack provides added depth too, from enjoyable environmental tracks to others that set the mood from calm to action, and even a bit of partying. Extras can be collected, such as music tracks, character information, and items, all of which can be viewed in a base that is accessible between chapters. You earn karmarines which can be then used in a turn machine that drops out items. Karmarines are earned by completing side and main quests as well as challenges.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Threefold Recital is part-game, part-philosophy lesson and it's been made with a lot of heart. The three main characters all stand out well, and the story is generally good, even if it becomes a little too twisty in the middle. That aside, Threefold Recital marks a strong start for the 2025 indie scene.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-units-from-new-warhammer-40k-death-korps-army-box<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop sent us along a brand new box of their <em>Warhammer 40K</em>&nbsp;Death Korps of Krieg Army Box, and I set to work reading through the rules (the box contains data cards and a nice glossy version of the Astra Militarum Codex) and checking out the models. Now that I've got a good handle on everything, let's run through a quick ranking of the models in the Army Box.</p>

<h2>#4 - Death Riders</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=nk37L9oj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-death-riders.jpeg?itok=vSKukE9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Death Riders gallop in at the top of our list! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Okay, okay... here's the big secret with this list: all of the models included in this Army Box are pretty damn good. But I set out to challenge myself to rank them from "worst" to "best." So I'm shocking even myself by saying that the Death Riders - while looking extremely cool on their enhanced Krieg Steeds - don't quite live up to the excitement of the rest of the models in the box.</p>

<p>With a 10" move (doesn't that feel a little slow for cavalry? The Attilan Rough Riders have a 12" move) and bearing a lascarbine and a frag lance, they're fine at a distance, but nothing extraordinary. They also have a power sabre and their steeds' claws for when you're done charging. They also have a special ability "Screening Line," allowing them to make a Normal 6" move whenever an enemy gets within 9" of them.</p>

<p>None of this is bad, in fact they can be quite a handful on the table... but there's just not much too them!</p>

<h2>#3 - Lord Marshal Dreir</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=ru9Egrl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-lord-marshal-drier.jpeg?itok=Rm6Jm5Vv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Lord Marshal leads from horseback, hard to get him into a tank! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Hmm... maybe I'm just a horse hater? Coming in at number three is Lord Marshal Dreir, an epic hero and officer for Krieg who can be attached to the aforementioned Death Riders. He's also got a 10" move, and has 6 wounds. Those 6 wounds aren't as bad as they sound, as he has "Feel No Pain 6+" and the "Tough To Kill" special ability which basically allows you to re-set him up if he's destroyed by rolling a 2 or better once per game.</p>

<p>Not too shabby! Add to that his "Leading the Charge" special ability, which gives his unit's melee weapons the "Devastating Wounds" ability (crits can't be invuln saved against). Speaking of weapons, he is an infantry chopper with his Sabre of Sacrifice, which has Anti-Infantry 4+ (pairing nicely with the Devastating Wounds from a charge).</p>

<p>But that's... pretty much it for him. Yes, he has the ability to give up to 3 Orders to his units, but other than that he's just armed with a laspistol. For a character larger than life like Dreir, it would have been nice to see him kitted out a bit more.</p>

<h2>#2 - Kreig Combat Engineers</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=KaCymLlK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-combat-engineers.jpeg?itok=DJoPc0sg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Now THIS is what I think of when I think about Death Korps! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Now we're talkin'! Of all the new <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Death Korps units included in this box, the Krieg Combat Engineers bring a lot of flexibility and some serious firepower. Each model comes with a standard Auto pistol and trench club, but you can upgrade individual models with flamers, combat shotguns, and more to suit your needs.</p>

<p>Also, these little dudes are meant to get moving on the battlefield with their "Scout 6"" ability, and their "Remote Mine" ability (which sports an incredible miniature to serve as a marker) can really do some damage. It reads: "Once per battle, at the start of your Shooting phase, you can select one enemy unit within 12" of the bearer and roll one D6: on a 3+, that enemy unit suffers D6 mortal wounds, or D3+3 mortal wounds instead if it is a Vehicle or Fortifications unit." OUCH!</p>

<p>I also love the look of them... maybe that's one of the reasons I'm instantly drawn to them. Krieg just look kinda off on horses. They should be crawling on their bellies through razorwire, not galloping on mutated horses!</p>

<h2>#1 - Artillery Team</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=4o-Ew-eD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-death-korps-artillery-team.jpeg?itok=fHEX1Ng8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When you truly need to bring the BOOM! Image: Games Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, let's get to the most gorgeous model in the set - and in my opinion the one that packs the most punch! While not tied specifically to Death Korps, the Artillery Team model is a slow-rolling source of death for all unlucky enough to fall within its sights. While it only has a 3" move, as you'd expect from an Artillery Team, the unit has a 7 toughness, a 3+ save, and 10 wounds!</p>

<p>But what really makes this so nasty is the choice of builds here. You can build the Artillery Team with a Heavy Mortar (pictured), a siege cannon, a heavy quad launcher, or a multiple rocket launcher. Siege and heavy quad are fun options, but for me it's all about either the heavy mortar (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 8 strength, -1 AP, 2 Damage per hit) or the multiple rocket launcher (48" range, D6+3 attacks, 5+ BS, 2 strength, -1 AP, 1 Damage per hit).</p>

<p>If you're looking to punch through heavy armor, take the high-strength heavy mortar. But if you want to whittle down infantry, the multiple rocket launcher has Anti-Infantry 3+ (meaning you wound infantry on a wound roll of 3 or better!) and is a really strong option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No matter the build, you add to that the "Remorseless Barage" ability which reads: "In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, if one or more of those attacks made with an Indirect Fire weapon [Giaco's note: all the options have Indirect Fire] scored a hit against an enemy unit, that unit must take a Battle-shock test (if an Infantry unit is hit by one or more attacks made by a multiple rocket launcher, they must subtract 1 from their Battle-shock test when doing so)."</p>

<p>So those are my rankings! How wrong am I? Please sound off in the comments and show me the error of my ways!</p>

So rather than get a look at the Switch 2 and, say, a new 3D<em> Mario</em> game, Nintendo is planning to only share information about the hardware itself, according to the insider. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-reportedly-reveal-switch-2-this-week/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-reportedly-reveal-switch-2-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em> reports</a></span> that this two-part reveal aligns with its heard, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1878827836741673217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren</a></span> also says he heard the reveal would be this week. </p><p> January 16 lines up with a previous rumor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hyhc9t/average_lucia_fanatic_who_correctly_leaked_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hyhc9t/average_lucia_fanatic_who_correctly_leaked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from someone called Average Lucia Fanatic</a></span>. They had previously correctly predicted the PS5 Pro and Nintendo Alarmo reveals, and claimed earlier this month that the Switch 2 announcement would happen on January 17. Average Lucia Fanatic went onto claim the full console would be released by March, with <em>Mario Kart 9</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> as launch games. NateTheHate suggested a hardware launch would come closer to May or June. </p><p>Whether these are rumors based on actual sources or just reasonable guesses, this week certainly <em>feels</em> ripe for a Switch 2 announcement.

RIP <em>GTA San Andreas</em>’ Big Smoke as Punisher and CJ as Winter Soldier.</p><p>Naturally, it only took a few days for fans to find a workaround. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dexerto</em> notes</a></span>, there are essentially two techniques for bypassing <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ new asset hash check. The first incorporates the modded files directly into the game’s .pak files rather than separately through a mod manager. It’s a much bigger hoop than most players will want to jump through, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but it works</a></span>. </p><p>The second method is a bit more straightforward, but requires a very beefy SSD. It seemingly revolves around unpacking and repacking files quickly enough to skirt the new checks, and comes with the risk of overheating your PC as a result. “You can just extract the pak files like a zip and run them unpaked,” reads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new how-to by prafit1111 over on <em>NexusMods</em></a></span>. “The problem is, the game is loading 50,000 files versus 1 so this can be quite problematic even on the fastest SSDs. Using a solution like this could even make your SSD die faster.”</p><p>Plus, even if you don’t corrupt your game install or kill a piece of your rig, continuing to mess around with mods still risks permanently losing access to your account and all the cosmetics you’ve already purchased or unlocked. “It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned,” NetEase recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement.

This installment is billed as having “the most exhilarating action in the series' history,” Dynasty Warriors: Origins also harnesses the power of modern gaming hardware to pit your character against the most onscreen enemies ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you want to know why it’s so good, in IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-review">Dynasty Warriors: Origins review</a>, critic Jada Griffin wrote:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Dynasty Warriors: Origins is meant to be a new beginning, it’s one that gets off to a masterful start. It doesn’t just have the largest amount of enemies the series has thrown on screen at once, it also deepens its combat, improves its storytelling without getting in the way of the action, and provides a healthy amount of replayability and postgame content – all while looking better than ever. Your amnesiac hero is a bit too much of a blank slate at times, but the impressive ensemble cast made this story sing as I grew to care about the characters around him, big and small. Origins is both a great entry point for newcomers and a triumphant return for veterans like me who felt the last few entries had become stale or missed the mark. It feels like the series I once loved is finally back. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dynasty Warriors: Origins Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster">Suikoden 1 &amp; 2 HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Rather, it’s a brand new game, something Larian was keen to move on to after trying and failing to spark enthusiasm internally for a Baldur's Gate follow-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In November 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-big-game-as-xbox-announcement-nears"><u>Vincke spoke in vague terms about the studio’s next project</u></a>. “I wish I could tell you about our next big game but this is really encouraging us to ensure it pushes many boundaries,” Vincke teased in response to Baldur’s Gate 3’s many The Game Awards nominations. “I’m very excited about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July 2023, ahead of Baldur’s Gate 3’s explosive launch, Vincke told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-developer-larian-will-definitely-make-a-divinity-original-sin-sequel-but-not-before-a-well-earned-break"><u>a sequel to Larian’s own Divinity: Original Sin series is on the cards</u></a> too, although fans shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's our own universe we built, so we're definitely gonna get back there at some point,” Vincke said. “We will get back there at some point. We'll first finish [Baldur's Gate 3], and then take a break, because we will need to refresh ourselves creatively also. You’re seeing 400 developers putting their heart and souls into this. You’re getting the best of them and their craft into this game. And so I can tell you, it's quite a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Divinity isn’t next, perhaps a brand new game set in a completely different universe? Larian has created fantasy RPGs for some time now. Could it branch out into science fiction? Or a modern day setting? Or maybe even try a new genre?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels like it may be some time — years even — before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Bungie's all-new IP, codenamed Gummy Bears, is a team-based competitive MOBA that has now been handed over to a brand-new PlayStation studio.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/exclusive-details-bungie-moba-smash-bros-gummybears/">The Game Post</a>, which said that about 40 Bungie developers are working with the new studio to expand the "vibrant and colourful" Super Smash Bros-esque game to "attract a younger audience" and diversify both its portfolio and audience. According to sources, it's been in development for around three years and is getting "overwhelmingly positive feedback".</p>

<p>There's more, too. The report hints that "multiple" anonymous sources claim Gummy Bears' players "won't have traditional health bars" but instead use a "percentage-based damage system where characters are knocked back further based on how much damage" they take or inflict.</p>
<p>We're told it'll be a "lo-fi and cosy" competitive PvP team-based game with the fundamentals of a MOBA and splashes of Smash Bros.</p>
<p>There'll be several modes and three class types, including Support, Attack, and Defense. Interestingly, players will also be able to "hang out with friends in-between matches and express <em>their</em> identities in the game".</p>
<p>We've reached out to PlayStation for comment about both the game itself and the mysterious new studio developing it - we'll let you know as/when it comes back to us.</p>
<p>Presumably it won't be adapted from the '80s Disney cartoon of the same name pictured above... but we'll see, I guess?!</p>
<p>As for Bungie itself? Almost exactly a year since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reportedly-delays-destiny-2s-final-shape-expansion-and-marathon">it was reported</a> Bungie had delayed its sci-fi extraction shooter Marathon into 2025, the studio released a gameplay-free developer update saying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-says-marathon-on-track-but-a-little-early-to-show-in-first-developer-update">the game is "on track", albeit a "little early to show"</a> - and that it'll "reveal a lot more" later this year.</p>
<p>The update marked the first promotional push from Bungie after it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">laid off 220 staff</a> - roughly 17 percent of its workforce - in July 2024.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
