			<p>As many fans were hoping and praying, Geoff Keighley himself has officially confirmed that Hollow Knight Silksong will not be at Gamescom Opening Night Live. In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1824923122929119364%7Ctwgr%5E6c037ce01b6b1f449db9cec0e0dd69ac61322759%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live%2F1100-6525900%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on X</a>, he made the statement so that people could lower their expectations for Hollow Knight Silksong being at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>In the post, he says, "Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. Team Cherry is still cooking." Fans have been patiently waiting for any news on Silksong since 2019 when it was first announced on Valentine's Day in 2019, alongside a developer diary video. Since then, updates have been very few and far between, with minimal information given to those waiting for the sequel. In 2019, fans saw the most updates for Hollow Knight Silksong, with the most recent update being in 2022, when fans saw a brand-new trailer for the game.</p>
<p>Past that point, they did express that there were delays in the development, with Team Cherry initially planning to release Hollow Knight Silksong in 2023. However, 2023 quickly came and went, and there was, unfortunately, still no sign of it. The latest glimpse of progress is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESRB rating for Hollow Knight Silksong,</a> which went live on the Xbox Store Page about four months ago.</p>
<p>As far as people know, Hollow Knight Silksong is still very much in development, with no news of it being canceled or further delayed. Unfortunately, no one knows how much progress Team Cherry has made during this time.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gamescom Opening Night Live has seen some huge announcements. While people have expressed their disappointment in the lack of Hollow Knight Silksong, they are now (jokingly) holding out hope for Bloodborne or Bloodborne 2.</p>
<p>So far, it has been confirmed that people can expect to see content from Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Indiana Jones, and The Great Circle, as well as a brand-new game made by Tarsier Studios, the developers behind award-winning Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>In addition to those titles, viewers will also get glimpses into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, MARVEL Rivals, Black Myth: Wukong, and Dune Awakening, to name a few. There is something for everyone to look into for Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be airing on August 20 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM BST and 8 PM CEST.</p>
<p>Gamescom has a jam-packed schedule this year, so keep your eyes and ears out for any upcoming announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Level-5's upcoming life-sim-come-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond its original release date, and no new release date has been revealed either.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1825535030866628851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message</a> on the official European Nintendo X (formerly Twitter) account, the company reveals that <i>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</i>has been delayed and that "more information about the new release date will be announced in the future".</p>
<p>The game was originally slated to launch on October 10th around the world for Nintendo Switch, but sadly, it seems it'll be quite some time until you can enjoy Level-5's latest cozy adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=PPx5bT22 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=K7IRRN1y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's now unclear when exactly&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will arrive.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in February 2023 as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>A full-blown sequel to 2013's 3DS RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, the game, which is being developed by&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>creator Level-5, was originally due to launch sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>However, in November of that year, Level-5 announced that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed">would be pushed back to 2024</a>, citing a need to ensure that the game was "better quality for everyone" when it eventually launched.</p>
<p>That same month, Level-5 revealed a summer 2024 release window for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, eventually announcing a full release date of October 10th during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">this past February's Nintendo Direct</a> (although it may have been somewhat overshadowed by the Xbox-on-Switch reveals).</p>

<p>When the game does eventually arrive, it'll offer a similar blend of simple action-RPG combat and life-sim job dabbling as its predecessor did.</p>
<p>Taking place once again in the land of Reveria,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will task you with solving two core mysteries: one revolving around the titular "girl who steals time", and another concerning a dragon soaring through Reveria's skies.</p>
<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>isn't available for pre-order yet, but you can keep up with it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the Nintendo eShop</a> if you want to. Level-5 <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/240819/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says it'll announce a new release date</a> during its "To the World's Children" event, although we're not sure when that will be just yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

There is no humanity here, just humorless humans.﻿</p></blockquote><p>Hopefully the box-office stink doesn’t linger on the video game series itself. <em>Borderlands</em> has always been a fun and gorgeous RPG shooter, with <em>Borderlands 2 </em>being a real standout and the recent <em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</em> putting a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons-</em>flavored tabletop fantasy twist on the loot shooter formula.

<p>Hideo Kojima has teased the arrival of a new character for Death Stranding 2 through his latest post on <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1825443327455723644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kojima’s latest post includes a silhouette of the character with the words ‘Who Am I?’. Players might remember that Elle Fanning was teased similarly before the official announcement. Moreover, with Gamescom ONL taking place tomorrow, Kojima might provide players with an official reveal and other details about Death Stranding 2.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is difficult to discern who the new character arriving for Death Stranding 2 is. However, players on Reddit have zeroed in on one actor. As per one of the recent posts on the r/DeathStranding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1evwgbj/kojima_posted_a_new_ds2_teaser_featuring_kenjiro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a>, players believe that the teased character is none other than Japanese actor Kenjiro Tsuda.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kenjiro Tsuda was involved in the previous Death Stranding game as the Japanese voice actor for Sam Bridges. The existing connection has led players to speculate that he may receive a character in the sequel. Tsuda is well-known for voicing popular anime characters such as Kento Nanami in Jujutsu Kaisen, Seto Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh!, Overhaul in My Hero Academia and more. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.</p>



<p>In other news, Death Stranding has become <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-mod-delivery-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a true delivery boy simulator</a> thanks to one mod. Also, check out Death Stranding 2: On the Beach’s previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer</a>.

Alongside the tease is the promise of more information at ONL, which kicks off at 11am PT / 2pm ET tomorrow, August 20.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825502979950064033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what is The Beast? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ew046c/comment/liv2zx5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have already linked</a> it to a recent trademark for a new Dying Light game called Dying Light: The Beast, which popped up on the United States Patent and Trademark Office last week. Dying Light developer Techland is listed as the owner of the trademark.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1823724772607582497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The question now is whether Dying Light: The Beast is DLC for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-2">Dying Light 2</a>, a standalone expansion, a smaller-scale entry or spin-off, or what should be considered a fully-fledged sequel in the Dying Light series.</p><p>Dying Light 2 launched two-and-a-half years ago, in February 2022, as a sequel to the hugely popular zombie kill ‘em-up Dying Light. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-2-sold-5-million-units-in-its-first-month-dying-light-1-has-crossed-20-million-units-sold">It sold five million copies in its first month on sale</a>.

Confirmed games set to appear during the two-hour show include Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Civilization 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The microtransaction debate has been raging within the gaming industry for years now, and it’s not just players who question the necessity of the extra purchases. In a recent survey among developers at <a href="https://www.devcom.global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devcom</a> 2024 in Cologne, nearly 90% of those asked said that premium games don’t need microtransactions.</p>



<p>According to the 100 developers asked out of the 300 speakers at the event, 89% said that they believe that premium AAA games can be “financially successful just by being Buy-to-Play.” Sticking with business models, 65% of people believe in a premium game’s model for both physical and digital games. Only one person believed that free-to-play with ads was the best direction of the industry.</p>



<p>In other areas of the survey, 31% of developers prefer little AI usage in game development. That said, 21% did have interest in using AI to help with coding and general production to increase the development speed of the games.  Finally, in regards to AI, the belief among those polled was that AI could replace human localizations and translations within the next 12-24 months.</p>



<p>Moving on to challenges facing the industry as a whole, 55% believe it’s caused by market saturation while another 46% point towards the rising development costs of games. Regarding layoffs, 57% said that layoffs will continue either at the same pace or a higher pace over the next 12 months. On the opposite side of things, 43% said that layoffs will decrease within the same time frame.</p>



<p>Devcom is currently taking place in Cologne, Germany alongside Gamescom 2024. Insider Gaming will be at Gamescom all week long, bringing you the latest from the annual event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-resident-evil-2-gog-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>will soon be available on its platform in all its pixelated, blocky glory, so get ready to revisit Raccoon City as it was in the late 90s.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1825451410843930690" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>will launch on GOG on August 27th. It follows on from the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, which arrived on GOG's platform <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1805874548937482308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in late June</a>.</p>
<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be available to buy separately on GOG, but you can also avail yourself of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a bundle</a> that includes both games, as well as the upcoming re-release of the third game, which has yet to receive a release date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-2-gog-re-release.jpg?itok=auS9kaGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-2-gog-re-release.jpg?itok=y-20RSnl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>may not be as shiny as the remake, but it's still got some survival horror thrills to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you only know&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">excellent 2019 remake</a>, then the sheer low-poly glory of the 1998 original may come as something of a shock to you, but that's 1998 survival horror for you.</p>
<p>Much like the remake, the original game features two different playable characters, Leon and Claire. You'll take a different route through the game depending on which one you pick, and you'll find different items and weapons along the way as well.</p>
<p>Unlike the remake, however, the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>features fixed-camera, pre-rendered environments and tank controls, which can perhaps take a little getting used to if you're accustomed to the smoother&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>-inspired gameplay style of the 2019 version.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em>'s intro to its Claire campaign right here. Marvel at the early 3D models and, er, "interesting" voice acting.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>lands on GOG on August 27th. We still don't have a release date for the third game on GOG yet, so stay tuned for more on that and all other things&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>-related.</p>

Every attack from the Shifu, including follow-ups and counters, will provide March 7th with one point of charge. Reaching a minimum of seven points gives her an immediate action with an enhanced basic attack. Further, the ally’s path will determine whether March 7th’s Basic ATK deals additional DMG or an increased Toughness Reduction. I’ll be going over how to unlock this multi-talented warrior and how to craft the best builds.</p><h2 id="h373920"><a id=""></a><strong>How to unlock March 7th (The Hunt)</strong></h2><p>Acquiring this character can be a little confusing due to the limited-time event centered around her. <strong>I do want to stress that you can only unlock the character by working your way through the story and reaching the Trailblaze Continuance mission “March to Mastery: A Star Is Born.”</strong></p><p>Although the Saga of Primaveral Blade event during version 2.4 does center around March 7th’s training, and it is possible for those who aren’t as far along in the story to play it early, this will not unlock her. The event only entails a fun minigame with the character and some great limited-time awards. Every player, early access or not, should go through the event anyway though just to unlock free Eidolons for her.</p><h2 id="h373921"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) team composition</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-recommend-id="image://dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-recommend-id="image://dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest advantage that March 7th (The Hunt) has is her adaptability. I’d argue she might just be the most versatile character we can earn for free in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. While you do want to pair her with at least one character who can constantly throw out attacks, the primary roles should revolve around Break DMG or Crit Rate DMG.<br></p><p><strong>If you want to focus on Break Effects and Break DMG, you should make use of Trailblazer (Imaginary) and/or Ruan Mei.</strong> Both are wonderful supports to provide all the necessary Break-related buffs. The former will be the most accessible, since they’re unlocked for free.</p><p>Building March 7th’s charge is a key responsibility for her Shifu, which is why characters with counter-attacks mesh well. <strong>Yunli and Clara can both perform wonderfully in this role.</strong> Although the former can dish out counters more consistently, the latter can aggro enemies into attacking her.</p><p><strong>Most Healer or Sustain characters will do fine, but Lynx and Gallagher are the best options.</strong> Lynx works especially well with either Yunli or Clara since they can both activate the second part of her skill that will aggro enemies to them. Gallagher on the other hand can dish out strong damage and the Besotted state he inflicts on enemies will result in more Break DMG.</p><h2 id="h373922"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) Light Cones</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-recommend-id="image://bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-recommend-id="image://bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a 4-star character that isn’t even a part of a banner, March 7th (The Hunt) doesn’t have any associated Light Cones to act as a perfect match. Thankfully, there are plenty of great Light Cones to give her.<br></p><p><strong>In The Night and Baptism Of Pure Thought are the top two five-star choices if you’re concerned about CRIT DMG.</strong> The former is potentially the better option since it can buff Basic ATK DMG too. A more accessible free-to-play option is Cruising In The Stellar Sea, which can be purchased from Herta’s Store.</p><p>Any of the above Light Cones should work fine with any build for March 7th (The Hunt), but <strong>the best to improve Break DMG would be the five-star Sailing Towards A Second Life</strong>. Even at the base Superimposition level, it will increase Break Effect by an outstanding 60 percent among a host of other buffs. If you missed out on pulling that, <strong>River Flows in Spring</strong> is a great alternative that can be purchased in the Forgotten Hall’s Light Cone Store. The buffs it provides will stay in play as long as the wearer doesn’t take any damage.</p><h2 id="h373923"><a id=""></a><strong>Which Traces to prioritize</strong></h2><p>Along with the base flexibility of March 7th (The Hunt), the character’s potential opens up even more with the right traces. Here are the ones to focus on first, no matter what kind of build you’re going for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Filigree – This is a must-have when it comes to traces and bonus abilities. Filigree allows March 7th to reduce the toughness of enemies with the same Weakness Type as her selected Shifu. Additionally, managing to cause a Weakness Break will trigger it as an Imaginary one</li><li>My Sword Zaps Demons – With her skill being purely for support, you’ll be using the Basic Attack the most in battle. It’s important to upgrade this as much as possible</li><li>Tide Tamer – This bonus ability is activated after using an Enhanced Basic Attack. The selected Shifu will have 60 percent increased CRIT DMG and a 36 percent increase to their Break Effect.</li></ul><h2 id="h373924"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) Relic Sets</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-recommend-id="image://9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-recommend-id="image://9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While March 7th has ideal Light Cones to be paired, there are some options that can work no matter what kind of build you’re using. The specific effects of Relic sets are much more suited to particular character builds though. Below are the best Relic and Ornament Sets to use if you want a Break DPS build.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-possibly-teased-in-new-gamescom-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXYuW0RTApA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, the official Gamescom channel possibly teased Dying Light: The Beast with mysterious live-action footage. </p>



<p>The first half of the trailer is bright and cheerful, while the second half turns gloomy and bloody, and closes with the tagline “the beast is coming.” </p>



<p>The trailer does not confirm anything, and Techland has not issued anything official yet either.</p>



<p>However, new reports surfaced just last week that Techland filed a new trademark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-trademark-filed-for-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for Dying Light: The Beast</a>. The trademark did not make the exact nature of the project clear.</p>



<p>Today’s cryptic new trailer, which may be for another project altogether, says that the big reveal is coming to Gamescom’s Opening Night Live. Fans can tune in at 11 AM pacific time / 2 PM eastern time to see the reveal live.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Beast Is Coming to gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXYuW0RTApA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans quickly speculated about the imagery and sound effects in the new teaser, trying to identify familiar elements from Dying Light. </p>



<p>The recent trademark for Dying Light: The Beast was not approved yet last week, so any appearance at Gamescom could be fairly small. However, it could at least confirm if today’s trailer is related to Dying Light, and what kind of content fans should expect.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825504189327233321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X,</a> Geoff Keighley replied to a fan asking for a “real” trailer instead of live-action or CGI. Keighley teased that fans should “tune in then.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dying Light 2 Stay Human launched in February 2022. Last May, the original Dying Light also saw its player count <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-player-count-soar/">rise by over 300%</a> following a massive sale. </p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for August 19 at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET. However, it's not the usual kind of Nintendo Direct that you'd expect.</p><p>This showcase is actually a 10-minute "Nintendo Museum Direct" and will be a tour of the Nintendo Museum that's slated to open this fall in Kyoto, Japan. To clear up any confusion and dash any hopes, Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291853861683644" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also said</a> that there will be no game announcements or any mention of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> during this presentation.</p><p>Nintendo has been upfront about what to expect from its Nintendo Direct presentations, especially when it comes to the Switch's successor. However, it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">confirmed that it will at least be revealed by April 2025</a>. The last Direct Nintendo aired was back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">June</a>, and it revealed some big games like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and it finally set the 2025 release window for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p><p>It's not out of the ordinary for Nintendo to have Directs focused on certain games or properties. After all, Nintendo had two Directs specifically for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-arrives-more-rainbow-road/1100-6512204/" data-ref-id="1100-6512204">The Super Mario Bros.

                <p>Team Cherry will not be showing anything related to Hollow Knight: Silksong this week, much to the dismay of many fans.</p><p>Host Geoff Keighley said on Twitter, "Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. Team Cherry is still cooking." Fans have taken the announcement and responded to it in humorous ways in order to cope with the news. One user <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1824924703066116210" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "So you're saying Bloodborne 2 has a chance," referencing the endless requests from fans for a Bloodborne follow-up or at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-wants-bloodborne-on-pc-too/1100-6524292/" data-ref-id="1100-6524292">least a release on PC and PS5</a>.</p><p>Another user <a href="https://x.com/sigmatic_/status/1824931803280379904" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "I appreciate the update man but was the pic necessary?" They were pointing out the image with the main character in clown makeup that Keighley used. It's a common trend that appears when fans hope that Silksong shows up whenever a showcase like a Nintendo Direct is announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-start-time-how-to-watch/1100-6525217/" data-ref-id="1100-6525217">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a> airs on August 20 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET in Cologne, Germany. Games that have been confirmed to be shown during the event include Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Indiana Jones and the Great circle, and a new title from Little Nightmares developer Tarsier studios.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-warns-not-to-expect-switch-2-news-in-new-direct.956667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-no-switch-2-news-direct-museum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Direct presentation, but before you get too excited, it's not the kind of show where you'll learn more about the Switch 2, a point about which Nintendo is being very clear.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291849990304138" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Nintendo announced yesterday that a new Direct will be held later today, and it'll show off some of the exhibits you'll be able to see at the Nintendo Museum, which is opening this fall in Kyoto.</p>
<p>The showcase will last around ten minutes, so it's not going to be a particularly long presentation, but it should be a good opportunity to learn more about Nintendo's history and find out more about the museum. What it won't feature, however, is any info about the Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=xH_hPIhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=Ew4WCL1T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, Switch fans. Today's Direct isn't for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Likely understanding that speculation about the Switch 2 is ramping up, Nintendo followed up its original Direct announcement with <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291853861683644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> stating that "there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" during today's show.</p>
<p>It might be hard to understand what kind of person would seriously expect a Switch 2 announcement as part of a museum tour video, but, well, there's a good reason Nintendo has disabled the chat on the new Direct's YouTube feed.</p>
<p>For context, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">announced back in May</a>&nbsp;that information about the Switch 2 would be revealed sometime before the end of the fiscal year, which gives the studio until the end of March 2025 to announce something.</p>
<p>Of course, March is a long way away, and the announcement could come any time between now and then, but every new announcement Nintendo makes, however seemingly unrelated to the Switch 2 it is, stokes the fires of rumor even further.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-direct-museum.jpg?itok=JAheMpGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-odyssey-nintendo-direct-museum.jpg?itok=u3H3cLek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect a&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>&nbsp;successor to be announced during today's Direct, either.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to tune into Nintendo's new Direct and treat yourself to a little slice of Nintendo history, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so right here</a>. The stream is set to start at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nintendo.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-dead-cells-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-dead-cells-update-brings-new-mobs-new-weapons-and-much-sadness.956664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-dead-cells-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Motion Twin has released the final&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>update, and although it's been a long time coming, the update is also tinged with sadness, as it represents the end of major content drops for the roguelite platformer.</p>
<p>Appropriately enough given Motion Twin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-cells-updates-ending">comments back in February</a>, Update 35 is also known as "The End is Near", and it brings new Curse-based mechanics including new mobs, new weapons, and a new biome effect that asks you to weigh up risks and rewards.</p>
<p>First up, you're getting three new enemies. The Sore Loser clings to you and curses you when you kill it, while the Doom Bringer stacks curse when it attacks you rather than causing damage. Finally, the Curser launches a projectile that adds 5 curse stacks if you're hit by it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-cells-update-35-the-end-is-near.jpg?itok=c0AmD0S4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-cells-update-35-the-end-is-near.jpg?itok=iywD2raZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>is getting three new enemies and more as part of its final update.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want to encounter these new enemy types, you'll need to head into the new Cursed Biome, which features these mobs but which will also give you increased rewards as a result of its higher difficulty.</p>
<p>Cursed biomes will only appear in Boss Cell level 2 or higher runs, and the boss biomes themselves won't be cursed. Assuming you meet this requirement, biomes will have a 25% chance of being cursed, and there will always be at least one non-cursed biome per run with "no exceptions", according to Motion Twin.</p>
<p>You're also getting three new weapons in this update. Anathema is an AoE weapon that curses you (yes, you) if you hit something with it, and Indulgence calls down a ray of light to damage enemies. If you kill an enemy with it, you'll be purged of three curse stacks.</p>
<p>Finally, Misericorde deals critical damage if enemies have less than 50% health, but it curses you if you don't kill your target with said critical damage. Yeowch.</p>

<p>If you want to know everything that's new as part of&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>Update 35, you can check out the update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/588650/view/6100774879119621994" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>.</p>
<p>So, now that&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells&nbsp;</em>is (mostly) done, what's next for the teams that worked on it? Well, Motion Twin is hard at work on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-cells-motion-twin-windblown-gameplay">isometric 3D action-roguelite&nbsp;<em>Windblown</em></a>, and fellow developer Evil Empire is working on the very&nbsp;<em>Dead Cells</em>-esque&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-rogue-prince-of-persia-release-date"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>. Stay tuned for more on those projects!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/conjuring-a-gestural-spellcasting-system-for-vr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What should it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">like to be a wizard?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s what I had to figure out when I began prototyping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironstrikegame.com/">IRONSTRIKE</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, my VR co-op action roguelite. Adding magic was a frequent request from the players of IRONSTRIKE’s prequel, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ironlightsgame.com/">Ironlights</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so I knew from the beginning that I wanted to include some kind of spellcasting system. But it couldn’t just be a matter of selecting spells from a glorified menu. I wanted to go beyond radial menus or one-step gestures and design something that took real advantage of VR.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most importantly, I wanted something that rewarded </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>skill</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can trace my inspiration fairly easily. See, I’m a nerd. And I read a LOT of cheap fantasy books as a kid. What made the spellcasters in these books so cool wasn’t (just) that they could throw fireballs around. It’s that they were skillful experts of the arcane arts, manipulating complex energies by practicing intricate gestures and memorizing mystical incantations. (They were nerds too!)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I decided that I wanted a magic system that:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Makes full use of VR motion controls</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Is conceptually simple and viable for total newbies to use in a fight</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rewards expert players who hone their skill</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can be used even when jumping, turning, and moving rapidly</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Makes you feel like an awesome pulp-fantasy spellcaster</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started by trying two very different approaches. Spoiler: both were doomed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failed Approach #1: Tracing Runes">Failed Approach #1: Tracing Runes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I started with a simple idea: tracing a line through the air.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(I failed to save my old prototypes, so here’s a mockup.)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This has some nice features. You can make the lines twist into all sorts of shapes, from very simple (e.g. drawing an X) to extremely complex (intricate runes). You could make the lines into cool 3D shapes. You could have two lines, one for each hand!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And even better: what if we only showed the player the *next portion* of the line they’re supposed to trace, rather than showing the entire complex path? That way, expert players who’ve memorized the entire spell can rush through it, while newbies can keep tracing it bit by bit until they learn it by heart!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Frankly, I loved this idea. I had a vision of players waving their hands through intricate convoluted gestures, but doing it so fast you can barely see the structure, amassing magical energy and then blasting it toward their foes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cool! But it fell apart during playtesting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem came from combining lightning-fast hand motions with precise line dimensions. Whenever we tried to cast a spell quickly, we’d repeatedly end up “missing” the line by a fraction of an inch, requiring us to go back and retrace the missed section, only to miss the line again a second later. This felt incredibly frustrating, and the frustration didn’t seem to get better with experience. Sure, at some level this was probably a “skill issue”, but it was still a problem if it felt </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>this </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">bad in practice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first I thought we could fix it by subtly tweaking the implementation. We tried a LOT of variations. For instance, what if we removed any sharp corners from the spell line? Or dynamically reduced the precision required during tracing? Or tweaked the tracing-detection algorithm in a dozen different ways?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few times, we were successful at making fast spellcasting viable! But this involved making the system so lenient that the best strategy was to flail your hands around wildly. Kind of the opposite of the “elite wizard” vibe we were aiming for.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failed Approach #2: Direction Sequences">Failed Approach #2: Direction Sequences</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Okay, forget the whole line-tracing complex-shape thing. What if the whole spell were just a series of directional swipe motions? Move your wand up, then down, then diagonal, then U-U-D-D-L-R-L-R and *poof* you’ve got a fireball!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Can’t get simpler than that! And it still had the potential to reward memorization and skillful execution. But it came with a few problems. For one thing, you can cast any spell by drawing rapid tight circles (i.e. hitting every direction) as fast as possible. (This can be mitigated in various ways, but then it starts getting complicated again.) For another, this system doesn’t use space in a meaningful way. It feels more like inputting a code than casting a spell. It doesn’t make me feel like a wizard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You could make this work, but I wasn’t thrilled by the idea. Thankfully, however, this inspired the mechanic that actually worked:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Synthesis: Line Crossing">Synthesis: Line Crossing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It turns out that if you combine the two approaches above, they join to form the perfect mechanic! Sort of!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We needed a mechanic that was more strict than just swiping in a given direction, but more lenient than hitting a certain point on a path. So, why not merge the two ideas: make the player swipe in a given direction </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>near a certain point</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, that sounds easy to implement! Define a spell as a series of line segments, and require the player’s motion to intersect each of those line segments in the correct direction. We can define an “intersection” either in 2D (by projecting both the line segments and the player’s hand motion vector onto a 2D plane) or in 3D (by giving the player a long wand / beam extending from their hand and detecting when it hits the line segment).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And... it works!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s easy to explain and teach to new players:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hhfo3y6bp3Q?si=Dxd5U-bmZiNsdw2y" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It can easily expand to accommodate lots of complex gestures:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WfrewV8X5Hc?si=DfqW6IfPQDz7xdLH" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And, with practice, you can cast complex spells quickly and smoothly:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJ1IyQDfKcw?si=ruUDDiXZPkTLX10A" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I can tweak the lengths of the line segments to control how precise the motions need to be at any point, but mindlessly flailing your hands around won’t cast these spells effectively.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This system encourages players to memorize the spells and to practice the physical skill of casting them quickly. Here’s some footage just recorded by an IRONSTRIKE player to show off their spellcraft in combat:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sexZ1KPMtrw?si=5JegYIAWUjTBYKlz" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This spellcasting system has been a great success so far. Casters represent about a quarter of players in any given run of IRONSTRIKE, usually playing the role of support or artillery. And there’s a ton of room for expanding the system with more spells, since it’s easy to author new gestures of any complexity</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I look back at this system, it’s interesting to note how the key elements (requiring a certain directional swipe / at a certain position in front of the player) are similar to those of one of VR’s biggest hits, Beat Saber. That’s not intentional, but that kind of convergent evolution suggests to me that these might be useful ingredients for other game mechanics. I’d be curious to learn about other systems that use a similar approach in the future!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/e_mcneill">@E_McNeill</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-late-october.956640/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>release date, and the digital card-collecting app launches in just a couple of months, so get ready to collect 'em all.</p>
<p>As announced during yesterday's Pokemon World Championships,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>launches for both iOS and Android on October 30th, which is one day before Halloween (and just one day shy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>release date</a>, incidentally).</p>
<p>The app was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced">February's&nbsp;Pokemon Presents showcase</a>, alongside a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game, although we sadly don't have a release date for that one just yet. Hang in there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=fFQ-ZrcW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-cards.jpg?itok=68bpyFir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>will let you collect and battle your cards digitally.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as offering the chance to collect various types of cards,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>will also feature a more "casual" version of the TCG battle system, one that you can enjoy either alone or alongside your friends.</p>
<p>The game will allow you to open two booster packs per day, free of charge, and since the app will feature all-new exclusive cards, it's worth doing so, even if you've got an extensive physical collection.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new "immersive" cards, which will effectively allow you to zoom into their artwork to "make you feel like you've leapt into the world of the card's illustration", as The Pokemon Company has it.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>announcements from the World Championships</h2>
<p>Besides&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, we also got new information about other&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-related games during the World Championships.</p>
<p>Morpeko is making its way to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>, and The Pokemon Company is also teasing "something big and mysterious" for the future, so stay tuned for more info about whatever this turns out to be.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Unite&nbsp;</em>is getting a new type of battle in which teams compete to be the first to reach 500 points, and new Pokemon Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck are joining the game's roster.</p>
<p>We also learned where the 2025 and 2026 Pokemon World Championships are due to take place. 2025's event will be held in Anaheim, California between August 15th and 17th, while 2026's championships will take place in San Francisco from August 28th to 30th.</p>
<p>Sadly, the event didn't feature any info about&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, nor did it play host to any announcements regarding the next generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games. Stay tuned for more on all things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>.</p>

After earning more than $1 billion at the box office, it’s officially the biggest movie of the year. <em>Inside Out 2</em> faces the horrors of puberty with a host of new emotions such as Envy, Ennui, Embarrassment, and Anxiety. Although it’s still going strong in theaters, <em>Inside Out 2</em> will be available for digital rental and purchase on August 20, 2024 through AppleTV+, Prime Video, and Fandango at Home.

The 4K disc will also be available in a beautiful, limited edition Steelbook. One awesome advantage that physical media has over streaming purchases are the bonus features which include a documentary on all the new emotions, deleted scenes, alternate opening scene, and other behind-the-scenes looks. While the first <em>Inside Out</em> explored Riley’s struggles with sadness after moving, <em>Inside Out 2</em> addresses more complicated emotions that invade Headquarters, the name for the switchboard that Joy, Sadness, Disgust, or any other feeling takes turns handling. </p><p>The biggest one is Anxiety, a frizzy-haired orange sprite exceptionally voiced by Maya Hawke (<em>Stranger Things</em>). Anxiety has some of the most relatable and emotional scenes in the movie, like when she moves so fast trying to control all her worries and what-ifs at the center console that she turns into an electric hurricane, but at the eye of the storm, she is frozen in fear. Anxiety also oversees a room that looks like an animation studio where workers draw a million different bad things that could happen. These scenes depict exactly what it feels like to have anxiety, and does so better than any psychology textbook ever could.</p><p>Anxiety has quickly become a ubiquitous part of popular culture, sparking hilarious memes from fans of <em>Inside Out 2</em>, like one showing her carrying multiple suitcases, with captions on each suitcase reflecting different stressors that affect people with anxiety. In response to someone saying “Just relax, there’s nothing to be anxious about,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/C8fTpMEOIj6/?fbclid=IwY2xjawErMsFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHe4jUUBNoEWozbR7ExS2UOAWktuud5vkfNtTJqkyq3LqpJhReUDCKMpg5w_aem_6gxb1LDWQk6v4_OLc9rmhw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8fTpMEOIj6/?fbclid=IwY2xjawErMsFleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHe4jUUBNoEWozbR7ExS2UOAWktuud5vkfNtTJqkyq3LqpJhReUDCKMpg5w_aem_6gxb1LDWQk6v4_OLc9rmhw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buzzfeed </em></a></span>shared an image where each suitcase reads the following: “Childhood trauma, dying, making an appointment, that one thing in third grade,” and “Do I smell?” The meme is simple but says so much. Not only do people with anxiety tend to overpack in general (What if it rains? What if I didn’t pack enough? What if I get too cold?), but past, present, and future worries constantly weigh you down. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Thought-i-was-a-disney-princess-turns-out-im-anxiety&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Thought-i-was-a-disney-princess-turns-out-im-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adult TikTokers</a></span> are also sharing clips of Disney princesses, joking that as children they dreamed of becoming as beautiful and elegant as Belle or Ariel, but instead they ended up like the small, perpetually jittery Anxiety with messy hair.</p><p>The widespread sharing of these memes, especially by older audiences, demonstrates the universal appeal of <em>Inside Out 2</em>—this isn’t just a kid’s movie, but one that manages to perfectly articulate an emotion that becomes harder and harder to deal with after middle school, particularly with new, adult responsibilities. <em>Inside Out 2</em> strikes a chord with <em>everyone</em>, which is why it has become one of the biggest movies of all time and why we can’t wait to rewatch it when it’s released on home media.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new rumour claims that Xbox is trying to re-license Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nHvGU-bBptQ?t=1h46m0s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode</a> of The XboxEra Podcast, Shpeshal Nick revealed some details about Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance. According to rumours, Nick claims that Xbox “is trying to work through the process of getting” the Xbox One ports of Deadpool and Marvel Ultimate Alliance re-licensed for PC and Xbox Series X/S consoles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Activision released the Deadpool game in 2013 for Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS3 and PS4, but it was delisted in 2014 when the publisher’s Marvel license expired. Similarly, Marvel Ultimate Alliance was also removed due to the license expiration. Because of this, many players have never had the chance to play these games. Buying a physical copy is not always ideal, as prices can be high after the games are removed from digital stores.</p>



<p>Regardless, this is just a rumour, and we will have to wait for an official announcement from Xbox to know for sure. Fortnite is the way to go if you want to play a game featuring Deadpool or other Marvel characters right now. The battle royale title recently released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-release-dates-for-deadpool-wolverine-content-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bundle</a> featuring comic-accurate outfits and accessories for Deadpool and Wolverine. Additionally, Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 marks the return of the Marvel season, with Dr. Doom taking over the entire island. Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-is-live-heres-everything-new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">everything new in the latest season</a>.</p>



<p>Talking about Xbox rumours, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-16-is-coming-to-xbox-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 16</a> is seemingly gearing up to release for the Series X/S consoles and PC. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-game-coming-to-playstation-next-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the next Xbox game coming to PlayStation have started surfacing online.

			<p>With such an established format as the visual novel, games now quite often look to break outside of the text-heavy storytelling with snippets of other gameplay genres&nbsp; that help break up the monotony of tapping endlessly through often unvoiced dialogue. Some of my favourite games of this style, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/03/va11halla-review-cyberpunk-bartender-action/">VA-11 HALL-A</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/16/coffee-talk-release-date-pc-ps4-switch-xbox-one/">Coffee Talk</a>, let you mix drinks and brew beverages between conversations, and that blend of interaction creates such a unique connection with the game and it’s characters. Tavern Talk takes that formula and steeps it in high-fantasy, but with a uniquely modern and tabletop-inspired voice that makes it one of the most unique takes on a Dungeons &amp; Dragons style setting I’ve seen in gaming.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tavern Talk: Launch Trailer | 20.06.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDEGfPJ_rg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tavern Talk, your humble inn and drinkery serves as a hub for adventurers, warriors, and pretty much anyone else to gather at. Some are looking for rest after a tough battle, others are sharing quests they need party members for, and a few just need a refreshing beverage and someone to talk to.</p>


<p>On the surface, a lot of these characters are pretty standard fantasy stereotypes – your pale blonde elves, your stout dwarf warriors, your aloof assassins and so on – but what makes all of them so interesting is that they aren’t characterised and written like typically stoic fantasy heroes. Instead, their casual tone and quite literal adherence to things like the D&amp;D alignment chart make them feel more like a real persons tabletop character mid-session. It helps them come to life in a much more interesting fashion, and leads to fun moments where you might see two characters with very different personalities instantly connect on a subject because of their placements on the alignment chart – you can even check this in-game through your journal.</p>


<p>When one of these characters visits your shop, they’ll ask you to make a drink for them. On top of general preferences for flavour or style, your patrons will also have stat-related needs that your concoction has to help with, requiring you to brew something that boosts strength, charisma, dexterity, intelligence, or defence.</p>
<p>The act of brewing a beverage isn’t very complicated, and I have mixed feelings about that. On one hand, the simplistic nature of the drink-mixing gameplay makes it easier to vibe with the story and follow it without interruption, but on the other hand, it gets so repetitive so quickly. Despite unlocking new recipes drink modifiers as the game goes on, your patrons will almost always stick to their same usual favourites. A more challenging version of the drink mixing would make your bond with the patrons and the info and rumors they share with you feel so much more earned and meaningful.</p>

<p>Once you learn enough info or rumours from various patrons, you can piece them together and post an open quest on your taverns’ quest-board to let any of your patrons tackle the adventure. This also isn’t as difficult or open-ended as I would have liked. There isn’t a lot of variety or meaningful experimentation that goes into putting these quests, or the drinks your patrons need before tackling them, together. The idea of your interactions with your shop visitors culminating in these big quests is interesting, but it already lacks some oomph since you don’t get to witness the quests at all – the lack of challenge in putting them together makes the most impactful moments of the game fall a bit flat.</p>
<p>Still, there’s a lot of charm and wonderful world-building to Tavern Talk that make it a worthwhile experience despite a lack of gameplay depth. The game is full of diverse, interesting, and engaging characters, and even the patrons who I despised for their rancid vibes or twisted personalities made for really interesting interactions. The world needs more drink-mixing visual novels, and Tavern Talk is a welcome, if slightly flawed, addition to that niche subgenre.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Tavern Talk is a wonderful window into a high-fantasy world that I never wanted to leave. Despite some repetitive gameplay, the unique tabletop spin on world-building and character interactions was an absolute delight.	</p></div>
