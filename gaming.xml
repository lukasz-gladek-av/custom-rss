In addition to importing a bunch of stuff from the sequel, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, the remaster also uses procedural generation to make nature look much richer.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b195482d98fc72c4dc71083f00a73b98" data-recommend-id="image://b195482d98fc72c4dc71083f00a73b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Concept art shows a beautiful forest.

Fellow environment artist Julian Hofman, meanwhile, said the remaster has a “fresh generation of moss,” and I know you’re probably thinking, “Who cares?” but in terms of a game whose best moments are often found in just quietly walking around its hyper-realistic sci-fi landscapes, well, I do!</p><p>The prospect of more populated cities also sounds really neat. “We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfill their needs,” said senior technical game designer Brian van Nunen. “We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation.” Yes...ha ha ha...yes!</p><p>That’s not to say I’m on board with all of the changes. While it certainly looks like some main characters and NPCs will have better-looking faces this time around, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1838823359632805922&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1838823359632805922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">George Lucas-ification of Aloy’s appearance</a></span> is a step too far to me. These remasters also have a tendency to wash out the colors and mood of the original in the process of trying to make them look even more  realistic. While the remaster looks very impressive in a lot of ways, some of the changes seem to to be the result of artists not knowing when it’s time to just leave their masterpiece alone. </p><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster </em>is out on PS5 and PC on October 31. Those who own the PS4 version can upgrade for just $10, though <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1fw499p/sony_delists_original_horizon_zero_dawn_on_pc/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1fw499p/sony_delists_original_horizon_zero_dawn_on_pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the digital price of the original game was jacked back up</a></span> to keep anyone from using it to get the new version at a discount.

The company itself has been quietly amassing a massive portfolio of studios and companies under its label ever since 2014, with its owned studios including Alan Wake Remastered co-developer D3T, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Marvel's Avengers co-developer Heavy Iron Studios, Luigi's Mansion 2 HD developer Tantalus Media, Age of Empires series co-developer Forgotten Empires, Hollywood production services company Blindlight, and agency PR firm Fortyseven Communications, among many others. Keywords acquired a minimum of four companies per year between the years of 2016 and 2023. As of the end of 2023, Keywords employed over 13,000 people around the world, per its annual report.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>A message posted on Team Folon's Discord server said the mod was "VERY close to being redeemed more than 1m times". </p>

<p>"We're incredibly grateful for the overwhelming support and positivity the project has received," the Fallout: London team wrote. "Your feedback plays a crucial role in our ongoing efforts to troubleshoot and fix bugs, and we'll keep refining Fallout: London until it's polished to perfection."</p><p>To that end, Team Folon now is gearing up to release another patch for its London mod. The video with further details is expected to go live later this afternoon, at 6pm UK time, so stay tuned for more. You can find the video below.</p>
<p>Team Folon's Fallout: London mod was released earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">following a few unexpected delays</a>, for free on GOG. It quickly became the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>It had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-developers-promise-incoming-fix-for-biggest-issues">a bit of a bumpy start</a>, but soon after its debut the team got to work fixing the "reported technical issues", while thanking everyone for their patience in the meantime.</p>

<p>As for the franchise more generally, Amazon's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV adaptation has gone from strength to strength. Following its critically acclaimed debut in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">show has since been watched by 100 million viewers worldwide</a>. To put this figure into more perspective, Fallout is the only other show on Amazon Prime to cross the 100 million viewer threshold, the other being Rings of Power.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hot off the heels of Team Folon's London project, a group of modders have set about working on their own international mod for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-seen-fallout-london-heres-fallout-nuevo-mexico">Fallout: Nuevo México</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even though I’m not big on the look of Funko Pops sanding down every art style and character design into a uniform look, there are some cute details in all three figures. Shadowheart carries the Mysterious Artefact she stole from the Githyanki before the events of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and Karlach wields an axe and comes bundled with a little figure of her teddy bear Clive that you can find at camp if you recruit her. Astarion is where things get a little interesting, as the vampire can either wield a dagger or has a one-in-six chance of holding the Necromancy of Thay tome. It’s like a dice roll. It’s meta. Either way, he has red eyes instead of the usual black ones most Funko Pops have, which is a cute touch.</p><p>I make jokes, but Funko Pops are at least an affordable alternative to the expensive premium statues that are so often released as tie-ins to major games. I can be a hater, I’ve got a few of those beady-eyed little fuckers on my shelves at home. As I write this I can see Ryuji Sakamoto from <em>Persona 5</em> in all his chibi glory from my desk. I’m a mark first, a hater second. So if you’re interested in a cheap tchotchke of your <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> fave, click through to see more. Maybe if enough people buy these they’ll also make Gale and I’ll have to eat crow.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-contribute-22-million-counter-strike/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/esl-faceit-contributes-22-million-to-counter-strike%E2%80%99s-25-26-esports-ecosystem.1013487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esl-faceit-contribute-22-million-counter-strike/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ESL FACEIT has announced a massive contribution to the world’s premier Counter-Strike 2 circuit through 2025 and 2026. A press release confirmed that a whopping $22 million will be contributed to ‘multiple professional ESL CS2 tournaments’ spanning the two years, with an equal portion of $11 million supporting each competitive calendar.</p>



<p>It’s a stacked schedule that kicks off in January 2025 with IEM Katowice, one of the most renowned tournaments in the world of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eager-investment">Eager Investment</h2>



<p>ESL FACEIT is one of the biggest and most valuable esports organisations in the world. The company’s origins can be traced back to 2000, and in 2022 a merger brought together the two components – ESL and FACEIT. This merger occurred during an acquisition by Saudi Arabia’s Savvy Games Group, which proved to be a roaring success.</p>



<p>In a recent press release disclosing the news about this multi-million-dollar contribution, ESL FACEIT’s Marc Winther said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>The EPT for Counter-Strike 2 is the definition of EFG’s commitment to fostering a fruitful competitive environment and continually nourishing Counter-Strike’s heritage, as we’ve done since 2000</em>.</p>



<p><em>With a circuit that spans multiple continents and integrates diverse levels of competition, we are excited to further fuel opportunities for world-class teams and passionate fans alike.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It has been a stunning year for Counter-Strike esports. In the summer, the most-watched IEM Cologne event in history took place with a peak viewer count of more than one million users. We saw the 100th IEM event held in Dallas in the spring, and across 2024, more than 140 million hours of Counter-Strike content were consumed.</p>



<p>CS2 also had a spotlight moment in Brazil as IEM Rio 2024 unfolded. Per a data-backed report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/iem-rio-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Esports Charts</a>, IEM Rio 2024 was a roaring success thanks to multi-streams and watch parties hosted by popular streamers.</p>



<p>The 2025 calendar is <strong>dense</strong>. Here’s what fans can look forward to next year in the Counter-Strike space:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Katowice (Jan – Feb)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S21 (Feb – Mar)</li>



<li>IEM Spring 2025 (Apr)</li>



<li>IEM Dallas 2025 (May)</li>



<li>IEM Cologne (Jul – Aug)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S22 (Sep – Oct)</li>



<li>IEM Chengdu 2025 (Nov)</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s a positive time to become a Counter-Strike 2 esports fan. What tournament are you most looking forward to? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-puts-team-on-notice-for-redundancy.1013460/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has put its development team "on notice for redundancy" as it looks for funding for its next project, the studio has revealed.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1847194285545848933" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Surgent says that while everyone on its team "worked incredibly hard to create&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>", studio management has decided "to put the work of the Surgent games division on hiatus".</p>
<p>The developer says it's created a prototype for what it says is a "bold new project". Surgent describes its new game as "darker, edgier, and more visceral than [<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>]", although it still retains that game's "high-octane combat and cultural depth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=jtMVP3lu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-redundancy-notice-boss.jpg?itok=K9J6Zb4Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>'s development team is currently on redundancy notice.</figcaption></figure><p>Surgent goes on to say that it's currently looking for a publishing partner for this project, a position that's becoming all too common among the indie sphere; recently,&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>developer Italic Pig revealed that it, too, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paleo-pines-future-uncertain">seeking a new production partner</a> for a potential&nbsp;<em>Paleo Pines&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>
<p>The developer also teases "a couple of exciting updates coming down the pipeline" for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, although it doesn't say what those updates are, so you'll have to wait and see to find out what's coming to the game in future.</p>
<p>When asked whether its next project takes place in the same world as&nbsp;<em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em>, Surgent said it was "hoping to answer" that question "soon". Sounds like the answer will at the very least be a qualified yes.</p>

<p>Surgent's announcement comes at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">trying time</a> for the gaming industry as a whole, with many studios both big and small suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-strike-stjv-union">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs">cancellations</a>, or outright <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">closures</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not Surgent will suffer the same fate remains to be seen, but given that&nbsp;<em>Zau&nbsp;</em>seems to have failed to make a major impact either <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16584/tales-of-kenzera-zau" rel="noopener" target="_blank">critically</a> or <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2316580/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commercially</a>, the studio seems to be in a bit of a tight spot.

<p>This is a fairly standard way to do business when it comes to studio acquisitions, as is the fact that Certain Affinity will seemingly largely be left alone, with its management team and workforce of around 180 apparently remaining intact.</p>

<p>As GI.biz points out, Certain Affinity <a href="https://www.certainaffinity.com/message-from-max/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laid off 25 of its workers</a> back in March, so hopefully, this Keywords acquisition means that more employees' jobs won't be at risk, at least for the meantime.</p>
<p>For his part, Keywords CEO Bertrand Bodson says his company has "enormous respect" for Certain Affinity, and that the new acquisition will complement Keywords' "existing skills", as well as "expanding [its] presence notably in the US and Canada".</p>
<p>If you feel like Certain Affinity's name is familiar to you, it's probably because you remember 343 Industries (which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games">now Halo Studios</a>) announcing in 2022 that Certain Affinity would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/certain-affinity-is-further-evolving-halo-infinite-with-343">joining&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>as a co-developer</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=nWbRGrJB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-certain-affinity.jpg?itok=6CYAElw9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also recognize Certain Affinity's name from its work on<em>&nbsp;Halo Infinite</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the latest in a string of acquisitions for Keywords. In recent years, the company has also acquired&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/keywords-studios-to-aquire-age-of-empires-developer-forgotten-empires"><em>Age of Empires&nbsp;</em>developer Forgotten Empires</a>, former&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>studio Hardsuit Labs, and porting outfit Wushu Studios.</p>
<p>Whether Keywords' acquisition of Certain Affinity changes anything about the studio's development process remains to be seen, although given that Keywords isn't making any personnel changes, more drastic shakeups are unlikely.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> launches on October 25, and if you're wondering if the shooter offers cross-play and cross-progression support, you're in luck: <strong>Black Ops 6 supports cross-play and cross-progression</strong>.</p><p>This post explains everything you need to know about Black Ops 6 cross-play and cross-progression ahead of launch, along with details on how to turn cross-play off and how to change your Activision ID.</p><h2><strong>How does cross-play and cross-progression work?</strong></h2><p>All players need to sign up for and log in to an Activision account to play Black Ops 6 online, and this allows them to use cross-play and have their progression move with them across platforms. As the latest Call of Duty games also did, Black Ops 6 allows users to connect and play with friends and strangers across all supported systems, and this includes Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p><p>For cross-progression, all game progress is shared on your Activision account. As such, players who start Black Ops 6 on one platform and later move to another will find their progression moves with them. Players must use the same Activision account, however. Progress will not carry over to a different Activision account.</p><p>Cross-play and cross-progression are made possible through your Activision ID. Also referred to as your Display Name, this is a unique account name to your Activision account that allows you to play across systems. The Display Name is your given PSN ID, Gamertag, BattleTag, or Steam ID, extended by a hashmark followed by a series of numbers to make your account unique to you.</p><h2><strong>How to turn off cross-play</strong></h2><p>Not everyone wants to play against people on other platforms, and that's a choice you can make in Black Ops 6. From the system menus, players can choose to toggle cross-play on (allows matchmaking with other gaming platforms) or off (matchmaking only uses current gaming platform). Scaling down to your individual platform will make the player pool smaller, but finding a match in a game as big as Black Ops 6 should not be a problem for anyone, whether or not they have cross-play on or off.</p><h2>How to change your Activision ID/Display Name</h2><p>Activision allows players to change their Activision ID/Display name by applying a "username change token." These tokens are not sold for money but restock every six months--the cap is two tokens at a given time. Here's how to change your details, <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-in-game-account-registration" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as relayed by Activision</a>:</p><p>To change your Activision ID/Display Name in the game, head to the Activision Account screen.</p><ol><li>Press <b>Options</b> on the home screen.</li><li>Go to the <b>ACCOUNT</b> tab and select <b>Activision Account</b>.</li><li>Choose <b>CHANGE DISPLAY NAME</b>.</li><li>Enter your desired name and choose <b>CONFIRM</b>.</li></ol><p>You can also change your Activision ID/Display Name online.</p><ol><li>Log in to your <u><b><a title="callofduty.com/cod/profile" href="https://profile.callofduty.com/cod/profile" rel="nofollow ">Activision account</a></b></u>.</li><li>Select <b>BASIC INFO</b>.</li><li>Select <b>EDIT</b> next to your <b>ACTIVISION ID</b>.</li><li>In the <b>ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED</b> pop-up, select <b>SEND CODE</b>.</li><li>Go to your email account to retrieve the one-time verification code.</li><li>Return to the <b>ACCOUNT VERIFICATION REQUIRED</b> pop-up and enter the code.</li><li>On the <b>BASIC INFO</b> tab and select <b>EDIT</b> next to your <b>ACTIVISION ID</b>.</li><li>Enter a new Activision ID/Display Name and select <b>SAVE</b>.</li><li>Enter the password for your Activision account.</li><li>Select <b>SUBMIT</b>.</li></ol><p>For more on Black Ops 6, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-ui-is-arriving-soon-with-the-black-ops-6-preload/1100-6527230/" data-ref-id="1100-6527230">first details on the new UI,</a> as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-launch-times-detailed/1100-6527163/" data-ref-id="1100-6527163">how to preload</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have always had an adversarial relationship with alarm clocks. They are gadgets designed to ruin my most precious time, and in order to work effectively, they must be as annoying as possible. Which is why I was intrigued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo’s surprise reveal of Alarmo</a>. (Once I got over my surprise of it not being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news">the long-awaited Switch 2 announcement</a>.) What if getting up in the morning could be a little more playful? Maybe what I really needed all along was Princess Zelda’s soothing voice or the chirps of tiny pikmin to ease me into consciousness in the morning.</p><p>After a week with Alarmo, I have to admit that it hasn’t changed much about my sleep patterns. It has some clever ideas, and it looks great on a shelf, but ultimately, it’s still an alarm clock.</p><p>But what a cute alarm clock it is. Alarmo is a red cylinder with a rotund white button / knob on top and a 2.8-inch rectangular LCD display with a big ol’ bezel around it that makes it <em>almost</em> seem circular, particularly in the dark. You can pick one of (currently) five different games — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pikmin 4</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23339801/splatoon-3-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a> — to customize how the clockface looks and sounds, so that Link or Captain Olimar can walk around the screen. It’s the kind of thing that’s just nice to look at, and the characters even follow you around when you move in front of it.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Alarmo has a number of Nintendo-ized alarm features. You can choose from 35 video game “scenes” to wake up to, which range from Zelda calmly saying “wake up” to, for some reason, the sound of a pikmin drowning. Each scene starts out relatively chill and will get progressively more intense the longer you stay in bed. The top button will even start flashing colors to get your attention. Alarmo lets you customize the alarm schedule by day of the week, and it tracks your daily sleep times along with how long it takes you to actually wake up after your alarm goes off each day. All of this info is available on the clock itself; it doesn’t sync with other devices or apps.</p><p>Navigating the device is pretty easy: for most things, you simply smack the big button on top. This works for everything from turning a blaring alarm off in the morning to opening the menu to tweak settings. Otherwise, you can twist the button to adjust things — like picking the time for your alarm to go off — and there are also back and notification buttons. (So far, my notifications have all been informing me of existing Alarmo features, but in the future, it will be used to alert users for updates to add more sounds and styles based on games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a>. This does require linking an existing Nintendo account to the device, the only real online feature I’ve encountered so far.)</p><p>But you shouldn’t be spending much time with those buttons because Alarmo’s big hook — aside from its Nintendo style — is its millimeter wave motion sensor. The idea is that you can interact with it simply by moving around. When it goes off in the morning, rolling out of the bed is enough to shut the alarm off. Wave your hand around a little, and it will snooze for a few minutes. In my experience, it works well enough, but with one big caveat: Alarmo’s motion sensors can’t distinguish between multiple people. So if I get out of bed but my partner sleeps in, the alarm won’t shut off.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>To be fair, Nintendo notes this issue right on the box (apparently animals can cause issues as well), but it does make the experience a lot less interesting if you share a bed. For most of the week, I’ve had to resort to getting up and turning the alarm off manually so that I don’t get in trouble for ruining my wife’s sleep with loud <em>Splatoon</em> splatters. Of course, given that a large part of the intended audience is children, this won’t be a problem for many people. Then again, my own children didn’t care much for any of the alarm or sleep tracking features anyway; they just thought it was cool having Mario on a clock. Note: this did not make it any easier to wake them up on school days.</p><p>You can also use Alarmo to help you fall back asleep. If you have a bedtime set, soothing sounds will start playing as soon as you get into bed, based on one of the five supported games (again, no button-pressing required). It has worked flawlessly for me, and I’ve become hooked on the<em> Zelda</em> nighttime theme, with its crackling fire and soft, intermittent piano. It’s like I’m dozing off in Hyrule Field after dark. But again, there’s an annoying caveat. For some inexplicable reason, the sounds only play for less than 10 minutes before going silent, so if you’re looking for Nintendo-themed white noise, you are out of luck. Hyrule is gone almost as soon as I finally get comfortable.</p><p>Those kinds of quirks make the actual sleep features of Alarmo feel like more of an afterthought. It’s first and foremost a $100 Nintendo-branded clock. It looks and sounds the part, which is to say, it’s incredibly charming and nostalgic. But if you’re looking for something to help you wake up better than a run-of-the-mill alarm or track your sleep more efficiently than an app on your phone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23449363/best-android-smartwatches-wear-os">this isn’t it</a>. Turns out, even adorable pikmin and inklings can’t change my mind about alarm clocks.</p><p><small>Alarmo is now </small><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311%2F"><small>available to purchase early</small></a> <small>for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and will be released in early 2025 for everyone else.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of these details were then corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider Gaming</a>. Activision declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p>While 2024’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> is set in the 90s to the backdrop of the Gulf War, 2025’s Black Ops game reportedly shoots forward to the 2030s, picking up where 2012’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii">Black Ops 2</a>, set in 2025, left off.</p><p>It reportedly continues the Black Ops storyline from that point, with David Mason from Black Ops 2 as the protagonist. Mechanics from Black Ops 6 said to return include the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-a-new-feature-fans-are-saying-will-get-people-banned-or-make-them-go-viral-or-both">body shield</a> and Omnimovement, with some tweaks such as human shields with grenades stuck to them that can be thrown at enemies, and wall jumping. Zombies mode, meanwhile, is said to introduce an eight-player mode.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Infinity Ward is reportedly hard at work on the next Modern Warfare game, presumably Modern Warfare 4. Perhaps that’s due out in 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Developer Treyarch has had four years to work on Black Ops 6, the longest development period of a mainline Call of Duty game yet. Expectations are high then after 2023’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023"><u>Modern Warfare 3</u></a>, which is perhaps the most poorly received campaign in Call of Duty history. (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in">Black Ops 6 campaign developer Raven told IGN it didn’t react to the Modern Warfare 3 campaign’s terrible reception</a>.)</p><p>Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022"><u>Modern Warfare 2</u></a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty"><u>Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</u></a></p><p>Assuming the reports of next year’s Call of Duty being another Black Ops game hot on the heels of this year’s Black Ops 6 are true, Activision will once again face tough questions around its value as a fully-fledged sequel.</p><p>In the shorter term, Black Ops 6 launches on October 25 and straight into Game Pass. It’s the first Call of Duty game to do so since Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for $69 billion.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has officially revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, a three-player co-op FPS set in the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>. It's due to land on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>
<p>We've known about&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>for some time, although not under that name. Remedy first announced a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-working-on-multiplayer-control-and-bigger-sequel">all the way back in 2021</a>; at that point, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-condor-is-multiplayer-control-spinoff-from-remedy-and-505">known as Project Condor</a>.</p>
<p>The game began as a collaboration between Remedy and 505 Games, but since Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>franchise from 505 earlier this year, it will instead serve as the studio's first self-published project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=tNKY4Im5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-2025-control-multiplayer-spinoff-soldier.jpg?itok=ajXYcuay 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is officially on the way to PC and consoles next year.</figcaption></figure><p>A trademark for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>was first filed by Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">back in January</a>, fueling speculation (which has now proved correct) that this would be the final name for&nbsp;<em>Project Condor</em>.</p>
<p>According <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/article/remedy-entertainment-unveils-fbc-firebreak" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Remedy</a>,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>will be a "mid-priced" co-op shooter in which you and your buddies play as members of Firebreak, an "adaptable response unit" sent by the Federal Bureau of Control to break a "deadly and prolonged siege by otherworldly forces".</p>
<p>The game will be split into different missions, and before each mission, you'll build a loadout from "specialized tools, grenades, support items, and paranatural augments", customizing them to create an approach that works for you.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, which also shows off some of the game's high-octane first-person shooter gameplay, right here.</p>

<p>Remedy says that you can enjoy&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>whether you've played&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>or not; it serves as a "standalone multiplayer experience" that brings an "entirely new perspective" to the world of&nbsp;<em>Control</em>.</p>
<p>This isn't all that's coming from Remedy on the&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>front, either; a full-blown sequel to the game is also in the works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">as a collaboration with Annapurna</a>, alongside TV and movie projects, although it's unclear whether Annapurna's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">game department imploding</a> will affect these plans in any way.</p>
<p><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025. It'll also arrive on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier">certain Game Pass tiers</a> and as part of the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog for Extra and Premium members on day one.</p>

<p>The top youngsters you need to focus on signing in EA FC 25 are <strong>Mustafa Hekimoglu</strong> as a forward, <strong>Franco Mastantuono</strong> as a midfielder, <strong>Finn Jeltsch</strong> as a defender, and <strong>Dennis Seimen</strong> as a goalkeeper. These players are young and affordable—great for all budgets—and become world-beaters in their respective positions.</p>



<p>For an even deeper look at EA FC 25’s Career Mode best wonderkids, we’ve broken down every area of the pitch and rounded up the top talents you need to sign.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-goalkeeper-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best Goalkeeper Wonderkids to Sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>While everyone wants to chase exciting strikers or midfield dominators, never underestimate the importance of a top goalkeeper. After all, it doesn’t matter how many you score, if you keep conceding, you won’t win many matches. An agile goalkeeper with catlike reflexes and immaculate distribution is a recipe for success. So, consider these youngsters for the position between the sticks.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-defender-wonderkids-to-sign-in-ea-fc-25-career-mode">Best defender wonderkids to sign in EA FC 25 Career Mode</h2>



<p>The value of a top GK is undeniable, but it helps if you have a rock wall of defense to protect them.

		<p>The bird &amp; bear are back, with Banjo-Tooie, their second Nintendo 64 adventure, flapping onto <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> next week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo 64™ – October 2024 Game Update – Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJgHERWE_eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/19/banjo-kazooie-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-library-20-january/">almost three years after the first game was added</a>, Banjo-Tooie will be available in the N64 app for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers from 25th October. It’s the first time that this has been available through a Nintendo emulation system, which is pretty exciting for those who missed out on the original, or don’t have an Xbox for Rare Replay.</p>
<p>Originally released for N64 in 2000 (and in April 2001 in the EU), Banjo-Tooie was at the tail end of the N64 generation and was in many ways the culmination of Rare’s time with the 3D platformer genre – Conker’s Bad Fur Day was a lewd fever dream that came out the following year, and bizarrely a week before the EU release of Tooie.</p>
<p>Building on the original game’s riff on the Super Mario 64 formula, and filled with a collect-a-thon of Jigglies and musical notes, Banjo-Tooie takes things to the next level in a number of ways. Rare was able to bring back some cut content and ideas from the original, but pushing the N64 even harder by featuring direct connections between its worlds for a more contiguous adventure, where the original had you teleport into each level. That’s featured in some of the game’s puzzles, which span multiple worlds.</p>

<p>The game also features multiplayer for four players, adapting the competition mode from the single-player to give first-person shooting, football and other minigames. It’s not entirely clear that this is included in the Switch Online version, but will be interesting to see.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-due-to-hit-early-access-in-2025-co-op-play-confirmed.1013367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and Unknown Worlds have revealed that long-awaited survival sequel&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is officially due to land in Early Access next year, and that the game will incorporate an oft-requested co-op feature.</p>
<p>During yesterday's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, Krafton and Unknown Worlds showed off the first official&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>teaser, and while it didn't give much away about the game, the Steam page and various other listings were also updated to reveal more.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>, you'll play as "a pioneer traveling to a distant world", and you'll have to explore a brand new aquatic alien world brimming with resources to gather, biomes to discover, and unique creatures to...well, to swim away from screaming, if it's anything like the first game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=J-xELovL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-reveal-creature.jpg?itok=UI9eZEAt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will bring...what the hell is that? It'll bring whatever the hell that is.</figcaption></figure><p>More Leviathans will be lying in wait to ambush you, of course, and you'll also discover "diverse ecosystems", although rather mysteriously, Unknown Worlds says "something isn't right" with this world, asking "what happened here? What happened to you? And more importantly, where are you?".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-2024-live-service">previously revealed by Unknown Worlds</a>,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>will feature optional co-op play for up to four players, but the developer is keen to emphasize that you can also play alone if you prefer.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give away much about the game or what its story will be, but it does show off a couple of interesting-looking creatures, and it features a sound effect that will probably trigger some "fond" memories if you've played the first game.</p>

<p><em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be the first "proper" sequel to 2018's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica</em>. That game was followed up by a sort of sequel-come-expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Subnautica: Below Zero</em>, in 2021, but&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2 </em>looks to be&nbsp;more of a full-blooded followup.</p>
<p>Whether the new game will follow the more narrative-led approach of&nbsp;<em>Below Zero&nbsp;</em>or the open-ended exploration of the original&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>remains to be seen.&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in Early Access in 2025.</p>

It has a metascore of 56 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a> and a 'mostly negative' user review rating on Steam. IGN’s own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 single-player campaign review</a> returned a 4/10. We said: “Underbaked, rehashed, and cobbled together from multiplayer parts, Modern Warfare 3’s single-player campaign is everything a Call of Duty story mode shouldn’t be.” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-campaign-review-vapid-and-hastily-assembled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> added: “Clearly rushed to market, Modern Warfare 3's campaign tapes together ill-conceived open areas, underwhelming linear missions, and a meaningless story.” In short, it was all a bit of a disaster.</p><p>A year later and Call of Duty fans are yet again faced with another campaign from the first-person shooter behemoth, this time the Raven Software-developed <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> campaign. IGN has just reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever">how Black Ops 6 is set to offer the most varied Call of Duty campaign ever</a>, but did Raven tweak anything in response to the reaction to Modern Warfare 3, or perhaps learn any lessons from Modern Warfare 3’s campaign?</p><p>Not so, Jon Zuk, associate creative director at Raven Software, told IGN in an interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“The campaign… all game development is very fluid and we react to a lot of different things, but in the case of the previous game’s reception, we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating,” Zuk said. “So we didn't react to how that was received.”</p><p>One key point of difference between the developments of Modern Warfare 3, led by Sledgehammer Games, and Black Ops 6, led by Treyarch, is time. Modern Warfare 3, originally conceived as an expansion pack for 2022’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">Modern Warfare 2</a>, reportedly imposed crunch on its developers as they battled to create a fully-fledged sequel in just 16 months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-report-reveals-that-modern-warfare-3-development-time-was-half-that-of-a-normal-call-of-duty">Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon has insisted Modern Warfare 3 was “years in the making.”</a></p><p>Black Ops 6, however, has enjoyed a longer development time than any other mainline Call of Duty game. Treyarch has worked on it for four years, ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops Cold War</a> came out in 2020. And for the campaign, Raven too has benefited from this extra time.</p><p>“The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away,” Zuk explained.</p><p>“When you have the shorter development cycle, sometimes you're stuck with things just for the time crunch that maybe you aren't as happy with as you could be. So I do feel like we had good opportunities to keep crafting and recrafting the missions until we were happy with them.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.</p></div><p>Players can also expect Black Ops 6’s campaign to be longer than Cold War’s, Zuk confirmed, although your mileage may vary depending on how much time you spend back at your safehouse hub.</p><p>“You can go back, you can talk to your team, you can upgrade your weapon and your equipment and things like that,” Zuk said. “And you can do a little bit of searching around the safehouse , but there's players who are going to do all of that, and there's players who are going to do none of that and are just, I want to get to the next mission as quickly as possible.</p><p>“So I think that the game length is going to be variable from player to player, but even if you do try to do the speed run version of it, it is going to be longer than Cold War.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6 is of course the first Call of Duty game to launch straight into Game Pass</a>, Microsoft’s subscription service. It comes after Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard for an eye-watering $69 billion, and has sparked a debate about whether the move will cannibalize sales of the game.</p><p>But will launching straight into Game Pass have a meaningful impact on the number of people who play Black Ops 6’s campaign? Unlike with previous Call of Duty games, Activision is not releasing an early access campaign for Black Ops 6, which means everyone jumps in at the same time from October 25.</p><p>Zuk said that from Raven’s perspective, it’s trusting owner and publisher Activision to do what’s best for the game. “I have no input in the business side of that at all,” Zuk replied. “The decision was made to not do early access this year, and I trust that Activision has thought out every bit of this and is very confident in the success of the title.”</p><p>We've also got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-cloud-gaming-launching-with-170-gam/1100-6482120/" data-ref-id="1100-6482120">launched Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> in 2020 with great fanfare, but the company's stated goal to push cloud gaming even further has run into some technological setbacks as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-apple-sparring-again-over-cloud-gaming-apps/1100-6526265/" data-ref-id="1100-6526265">ongoing conflicts with Google and Apple</a> over multiple issues. But now a new report indicates that Microsoft is making a renewed effort to extend the reach of Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>A report released earlier this month stated that Microsoft will soon be testing its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-soon-let-players-stream-all-their-games-not-just-those-on-game-pass-report/1100-6527140/" data-ref-id="1100-6527140">let Xbox owners stream any game in their library</a> even if it isn't on Game Pass. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272630/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-future-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, that's just the beginning of Microsoft's plans. The company is reportedly looking to add even more cloud-gaming features and introduce direct-to-cloud controllers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEulk3Ar00I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NEulk3Ar00I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The report credits the developer of the Better xCloud app for discovering Xbox's direct-to-cloud controller support, which apparently isn't quite ready to be rolled out yet. For now, Microsoft's priority is said to be focused on improving the visual quality of its streams in a bid to make it possible to play Xbox games without a console that can perform at the same level as the Xbox Series X|S. There will supposedly be forward momentum for allowing higher bitrates on Xbox Cloud Gaming "soon." However, fixing and upgrading Xbox Cloud Gaming's ongoing latency issues will reportedly take more time and "require more powerful hardware."</p><p>If Microsoft can deliver on all of those changes and give console-free gamers a comparable or better experience to having an Xbox Series X|S, then it seems likely to further erode the sales of physical consoles. Microsoft and Sony have both released digital-only consoles this generation, but if Microsoft really can remove the need for a physical console altogether then that might shake up the industry even more--although it didn't work so well for Google's Stadia.</p>
