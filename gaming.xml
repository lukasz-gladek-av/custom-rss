            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-gears-of-creation-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>developer Edelweiss has announced&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, a spinoff that also officially inaugurates what must now be known as the&nbsp;<em>Sakuna&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will be published in the West by Marvelous' indie brand XSEED, the company behind games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/loop8-summer-of-gods-gameplay-walkthrough-shows-off-xseeds-coming-of-age-rpg" rel="nofollow">Loop8: Summer of Gods</a>&nbsp;</em>and potion shop sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potionomics" rel="nofollow"><em>Potionomics</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>As you might expect from the title, the game will revolve around the titular Princess Kokorowa, a "high-ranking goddess presiding over wheels and inventions from her heavenly home". The debut trailer describes Kokorowa as "the tireless Goddess of Invention".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=2VfZH1I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sakuna-chronicles-kokorowa-and-the-gears-of-creation-princess.jpg?itok=cFO8gI-5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>will, as you might expect, revolve around Princess Kokorowa.</figcaption></figure><p>Along her journey, Kokorowa will meet larger-than-life characters like free-willed automaton Takebina, as well as a host of anthropomorphic animal characters who remain unnamed at time of writing.</p>

<p>We don't know a heck of a lot about&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>yet. Edelweiss and XSEED say they'll announce more info, including platforms and release timing, at a later date.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will largely utilize a 3D art style rather than the mixture of 2D and 3D favored by&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>, although it could just be that we're yet to see any of the game's 2D sections.</p>

<p>In any case, you can take a look at the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Released in 2020,&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>is a farming sim-action RPG hybrid that sees protagonist Princess Sakuna exiled to a distant island and tasked with clearing it of its monster infestation.</p>

<p>The game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-breakout-hit-stop-stock-trading" rel="nofollow">proved a surprise hit at launch</a>, halting the stock trading of publisher Marvelous (XSEED's parent company) after share prices skyrocketed owing to the game's success.</p>

<p>If you want to get caught up before the launch of&nbsp;<em>Sakuna Chronicles: Kokorowa and the Gears of Creation</em>, then you can grab&nbsp;<em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1356670/Sakuna_Of_Rice_and_Ruin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1023-CUSA09130_00-SAKUNA0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a> (and therefore also PS5 via backwards compatibility), and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

While Druckmann, who’s also been busy running Naughty Dog and co-creating the hit HBO adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em>, didn’t say when his next game would be out, the 2020 marker suggests it might not be too far away at this point. </p><p>The roundtable discussion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started making the rounds on Reddit</a></span> earlier today, but the VOD has since been set to private on YouTube. While <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to view the full discussion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another viewer</a></span> corroborated Druckmann’s mention of the 2020 date. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Naughty Dog has set the standard for blockbuster storytelling at PlayStation for years, but it’s been a while since the studio teased anything new. A <em>Last of Us Online</em> project that was expected to take the post-apocalyptic zombie survival formula into the live-service genre was suddenly canceled last fall. There’s also been a series of veteran departures at the studio in recent years, with Druckmann taking over as the top manager at Naughty Dog after former co-president Evan Wells <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642">left in 2023</a></span>. </p><p>Given current development cycles for the biggest-budget games, it could still be a few more years until Druckmann’s next game, whatever it turns out to be, is actually in players’ hands. Things that used to take three to four years to make are now increasingly taking five to six, especially coming out of the 2020 pandemic. In addition to a new IP, fans have also been waiting to hear about the fate of <em>Uncharted, </em>which has been on ice since 2017's<em> Lost Legacy</em>. </p><p>Druckmann did speak once before about his next game in a now infamous Sony interview that was transcribed so inaccurately, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885">entire thing had to be taken offline</a></span>. While the veteran writer and director was ridiculed online for appearing to suggest his next project would “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” he later clarified that he never actually said those words. What he actually said was, “people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.” </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ahead of the holiday season, and presumably to help drive sign-ups to Game Pass, Microsoft has rolled out a new ad campaign called "This Is An Xbox." The basic takeaway is that, as Microsoft has been saying for years, you don't have to buy an Xbox to play Xbox. That's because Xbox games are available across a variety of devices these days as part of Microsoft's new strategy to gain marketshare. Microsoft is, of course, is in third place against PlayStation and Nintendo.</p><p>Microsoft is going big for this ad campaign, with visuals set to appear in places like San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, London, New York, and Berlin. Microsoft also commissioned a live-action trailer featuring the song "The Choice Is Yours" by Black Sheep, which is rather fitting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYBSNQLsBKk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Microsoft partnered with companies like Samsung, Crocs, Porsche, and The Happy Egg for branding takeovers. The ads first display a product, say, a pair of Crocs, with the message "This is a pair of Crocs," and the next page shows an Xbox and says, "This is an Xbox."</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft is launching a giant billboard for "This Is An Xbox" at Times Square in New York City later this year. Beyond all that, Microsoft is selling themed merch at the <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Gear Shop</a>, including a t-shirt that says "This Is Not An Xbox," referring to the human wearing the shirt.</p><p>There is also an online quiz that asks people to identify what is and what is not an Xbox. It's a pretty fun and silly quiz, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/what-is-xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can take it here.</a></p><p>This is a new ad campaign but the idea has been in place for years. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.</p><p>And Microsoft is all about making money. After Xbox's recent 2,500 layoffs, Spencer defended the cuts, saying they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">necessary due to capitalism.</a></p>

			<p>With the current <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">high level of indie horror titles</a>, it can be difficult to stand out from the pack. Some titles attempt to distinguish themselves by trying to imitate genre standouts as closely as possible, whilst others mix and match from the most famous games. Sorry, We’re Closed, however, opts for a look and style that is entirely original. Add this fabulous aesthetic to the unashamedly LGBTQIA+ friendly characters and storyline and you have a game that promises to become an absolute cult favourite.</p>
<p>Don’t just judge the title by its looks, though, as the game itself is good enough to be worth playing even if the graphics don’t grab you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sorry We're Closed: Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KVxH1EunV7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It is the look of Sorry, We’re Closed that immediately arrests your attention. The lurid colours, neon-drenched lighting, and angular yet beautiful character models don’t quite fit with any specific console generation, feeling like a hybrid of PS1 and PS2 graphics at times but with an end result that is so stylish and distinctive that it just works. The various environments are all distinctive with the London hub looking suitably grimy and run down. The characters seem designed with cosplaying in mind and I look forward to seeing what content creators will do with them. Combine these aesthetics with a suitably cool and chilled out hip hop influenced soundtrack and you have a game that oozes style from every pore.</p>
<p>The game opens up with a TV soap opera cutscene that is revealed to feature the ex-girlfriend of protagonist, Michelle. The story that follows centres around ideas of relationship breakdown, attempts to move on, and the ways in which desire can change your sense of self. This is a fantastically original thematic background for a game, let alone a survival horror one. Gone are the khaki-jacketed sad husbands that dominate the genre; instead we have a main character with blue hair and a fabulous pink fluffy jacket. Michelle is dragged into a nightmarish alternate version of London when a powerful demon decides that she is the perfect target for their love – a love that has fatal consequences.</p>


<p>Exploring the world of Sorry, We’re Closed involves navigating the main hub area loosely based on London and then venturing into various self-contained levels in search of the mysterious items Michelle needs to break the curse, or even embrace it. There are multiple endings that depend on the choices you make in the character interactions throughout the game, adding welcome replayability and also a necessary sense of consequence to these turning points. These mostly rely on dialogue options and who you give or don’t give certain items to. My playthrough gave me a satisfying ending, even if I messed up a couple of subquests by not following the correct path. The progression here is very influenced by the Persona games, as the dungeon-like levels end a section of interaction with no opportunity to return.</p>
<p>During my playthrough I was particularly engaged by a long subquest involving an angel trying to come to terms with their relationship with another powerful demon. This storyline was wonderfully integrated into the central story and added a real sense of depth to a boss fight that was already mechanically challenging. The various boss fights here all tie into the curse with which Michelle is inflicted – a curse that manifests through a huge third eye in her forehead that lets her reveal hidden aspects in the environment, as well as see and therefore interact with the supernatural creatures that inhabit her home area.</p>

<p>Once in a dungeon level, the game plays out in standard survival horror fashion with limited resources, fixed camera angles, and a combination of combat encounters and environmental puzzles. The third eye mechanic is key here too, both in terms of revealing interactive objects for puzzle solving and in the distinctive combat system.</p>
<p>When entering combat the camera switches to a first-person mode. Activating your Third Eye mode reveals an enemy’s weakpoint, but you can only damage it by accurately hitting that point in this mode. The risk and reward system here also kicks in as it is only effective for a small radius so you have to let enemies close in on you. Safely picking them off from afar, however, will quickly result in you running out of ammo and being forced to rely on melee or running away.</p>

<p>The weakpoints take the form of colourful hearts with more powerful foes having several targets to quickly switch between. Hitting enough weakpoints charges up your weapon and enables a super shot that has to be carefully aimed or it’s lost. This is needed to finish off boss fights so a pattern of building up your charge and then taking out hearts plays out.</p>
<p>I played on Steam Deck and found aiming a little awkward, but the devs have fixed this in the release build, an update that fortunately kicked in alongside my entering the more challenging later levels. Performance on Deck was solid and it was a fantastic way to play the game aside from perhaps needing an option to increase the font size as it was a little difficult to read at times.</p>
<p>My only real caveat when recommending this to survival horror fans is that there are some huge difficulty spikes that could prove frustrating. Fortunately there is an accessibility option that toggles an infinite health bottle which I freely admit to using at times to ensure that I could get through the game in time to file this review. I do intend to start a replay without it though to enjoy the challenge now that I am familiar with the controls and mechanics.</p>

			<p>New The First Berserker: Khazan gameplay was shared online today, providing a new look at the upcoming action role-playing game in development by Neople.</p>
<p>The new footage, shared as part of <a href="https://www.gstar.or.kr/eng/gstar/gstar_info.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G-Star 2024</a>, which runs from today until November 17th in Busan, South Korea, showcases an intense battle against Volbaino as well as gameplay set in Mount Heinmach, one of the first locations Khazan explores after being freed from imprisonment. You can find the new footage below.</p>
<p><iframe title="G-STAR 2024ㅣ보스챌린지ㅣThe First Berserker: Khazan" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VYZLcjZiH7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan has quickly become one of my most anticipated games set to release in 2025 after I tried it out during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-gamescom-hands-on-preview-vast-potential/">Gamescom</a>. As I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/"> preview</a>, the Technical Closed Beta Test held last month only confirmed my positive opinion of the game.</p>
<p><em>The longer playtime of The First Berserker: Khazan Technical Closed Beta Test also allowed me to appreciate combat more. While it is undeniable that the stamina-based combat system is very reminiscent of the Souls series, the Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Nioh series influences are more prominent. For starters, the evade maneuver doesn't have a whole lot of invincibility frames, making it a little risky to use in close-quarter. The parry, called Brink Guard, on the other hand, is a much more effective defensive technique as it is generally easy to pull off and allows Khazan to stay on the offensive since there's a small cancel window at the end of each move that allows going into the guarding stance immediately, and it restores stamina while depleting the enemy's. An instant evade technique called Brink Evade, is also in, but it seems to interrupt the flow of combat when used to avoid attacks that could be parried.</em></p>
<figure></figure>
<p>The First Berserker: Khazan launches sometime next year on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

Marking Epic’s entry into the graphics arms race with id Software, the two games were both utterly brilliant shooters in their own rights, but also became the names behind the engines on which a generation of games would be built. <em>Half-Life</em> was based on the <em>Quake </em>engine, while <em>Unreal</em>’s was under the hood of <em>Deus Ex</em>. </p><p>What also made them special is that both Epic and id were developers who grew up with an understanding of the importance of shareware, free software, and putting source code into the public domain. It’s why anyone can use those engines, and many later iterations of them, to create their games, free, without license or restriction. There are many publishers who are so ludicrously obsessed with maintaining a death-grip around their most ancient software that they will sue anyone who dares touch it (cough-Nintendo-cough), and all attempts to preserve games they refuse to support are met with outrageous hostility. Epic, for whatever other faults you may wish to level, is not like this, and while it should be commonplace, instead it’s a rare joy to see something like the 26-year-old <em>Unreal</em> so freely and willingly shared.</p><figure id="" data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Internet Archive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Meanwhile, the backbone of the internet, the wonderful Internet Archive, has been through an awful time of late.

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-is-an-intriguing-idea-to-phil-spencer/1100-6522161/" data-ref-id="1100-6522161">saying for a long time</a> that he wants to make an Xbox handheld device, and now he's brought it up once more.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation is that we would do something" in that area. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft is currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">working on prototypes</a> and thinking about the best way forward. The site also reported that Spencer said any potential Xbox handheld would be "a few years out."</p><p>For now, Microsoft's designers and engineers are spending time updating the Xbox mobile app to offer a better experience on portable gaming devices that already exist. But on a longer horizon, Spencer said, "I think our team could do some real innovative work" in the dedicated handheld market.</p><p>A report from September 2024 claimed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next-generation Xbox console could also support a dedicated gaming handheld device.</a> Microsoft is working on its next home console, saying the system will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history.</a></p><p>Microsoft stands apart from PlayStation and Nintendo in that it's the only one of the so-called Big Three that has never released a dedicated portable gaming device--it seems it won't be that way forever, though.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer talked about Microsoft's mobile game store, noting that it's been delayed to an unspecified point in the future. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-set-to-launch-mobile-games-store-this-july/1100-6523350/" data-ref-id="1100-6523350">previously expected to launch this past July. </a></p><p>Spencer also talked about the possibility of making more acquisitions, saying he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-on-ps5-its-too-soon-to-say-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527732/" data-ref-id="1100-6527732">always considering options, but nothing is "imminent."</a> Additionally, Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-on-ps5-its-too-soon-to-say-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527732/" data-ref-id="1100-6527732">Halo 5 on PS5 has not been ruled out.</a></p>

        <p>A big overhaul brings modern visuals, gameplay changes and rain.</p>

</div><div>



            <p>More than three years after it was removed in the transition to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> and a week after Valve started teasing its return on social media, classic map Train has returned with a visual overhaul, gameplay changes and pleasant rain effects. </p>
<p>Like other maps remade for CS2, the graphical improvements here are substantial, with more detailed environments, improved lighting and more vibrant colours - despite the prevailing precipitation. The rain effects are also advanced, with rain drops falling on your character, slickening surfaces, splashing into puddles and even running in small rivers. It makes for a relaxing soundscape too. </p>
<p>The gameplay changes are surprisingly far-reaching too, with more open A and B bombsites that actually remove a handful of the map's characteristic trains and make the layout a little more friendly to new players - though there are still plenty of nooks and angles for everyone to learn. </p>

<p>Some iconic locations have also been changed, with the Heaven alcove above A site being removed and Pop Dog changing from a small ladder room to a longer passageway that connects A to the T spawn area and B. Thankfully, the Pop Dog graffiti remains, referencing the mascot of Barking Dog Studios that produced Counter-Strike Beta 5.0 and went onto develop Homeworld: Cataclsym the next year.  </p><p>In fact, de_train was originally part of that Beta 5.0 release just shy of 25 years ago, making it one of the oldest maps in the game. It was originally an American train yard that used textures from Half-Life and jet plane sounds, but the map saw a complete revamp in Counter-Strike: Source in 2005 with a more realistic look. That Source version was re-used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a>, but was eventually itself overhauled in 2014 with the layout and Soviet motifs familiar to CS:GO players. </p>

<p>As well as the return of Train, the patch also includes updates to the existing map Overpass based on community feedback, and two other maps for casual and competitive play have been added to the game. Scottish city map Edin appears for the first time, while a revamped Basalt returns after initially featuring in CS:GO's Operation Riptide in 2021. There are also two new smaller levels for the 2v2 Wingman game mode: Palais and Whistle. </p><p>Other changes in the latest update are detailed in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4458095069430284352">November 13th 2024 patch notes</a>, including the addition of a damage prediction setting that could make the game feel more responsive, performance improvements for incendiary effects and ambient occlusion for your legs when seen in first person. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, British independent developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellion-ceo-egs-exclusivity-was-very-good-for-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebellion</a> announced the release date of its next game, Atomfall. This single player survival action game will be available starting March 27, 2025 on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows PC and PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. Pre-orders are now live, with the regular edition priced at $49.99 and a digital-only Deluxe Edition priced at $69.9. The latter will include the so-called 'Enhanced Supply Bundle', which adds an exclusive pistol variant, metal detector skin and character upgrades. Moreover, owners of the digital Deluxe Edition of Atomfall will be able to start playing three days early, and they'll also get the story expansion when it launches in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Release Date Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_07x5LvQiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is set in an alternate world where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windscale_fire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Windscale</a> nuclear accident was much bigger and more troublesome than in reality. Five years later, players will freely explore the fictional quarantine zone, scavenging, crafting, trading, fighting and talking their way through a British countryside full of bizarre characters, mysticism, cults and rogue government agencies.</p>
<p>Here's an overview of the main features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Player-driven mystery:</strong> Unravel a tapestry of interwoven narratives through exploration, conversation, investigation and combat, where every choice you make has consequences.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Explore this green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Search, scavenge, survive:</strong> You'll have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out alive.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Desperate combat:</strong> With weapons and ammunition in short supply, each frenetic battle will see you combine marksmanship with vicious hand-to-hand combat. Manage your heart rate to maintain a steady aim and ensure you have the energy to grab your cricket bat and land that killer blow.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Green and unpleasant land:</strong> The picturesque British countryside, with its rolling green hills, lush valleys and rural villages, belies the dangers that await you. Navigate cult-controlled ruins, natural caves, nuclear bunkers and more as you explore this dense, foreboding world.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Reimagining Windscale:</strong> A fictional reimagining of a real-life event, Atomfall draws on science fiction, folk horror, and Cold War influences to create a world that is eerily familiar yet utterly alien.</em></li>
</ul>

			<p>Infinity Nikki, the latest game in the Nikki franchise created by Infold Games is set to release on December 5, 2024. This news comes after extensive Beta testing on both PC, PlayStation and even iOS and Android. So far, Infinity Nikki is shaping up to be a huge success before the game has even become available, as over <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home?shortlink=ajkmiqf2&amp;c=925TrailerPR&amp;pid=X6_MKT_PR&amp;af_click_lookback=30d&amp;af_xp=custom&amp;source_caller=ui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 million players have pre-registered</a> to play this upcoming game. If you want to see what we thought about the title, you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-preview-glitz-and-glamor/">our preview of Infinity Nikki</a> here for more information about what to expect.</p>
<p>If you're looking to get stuck into Infinity Nikki when the game releases, it is set to release on December 5 on PC, PlayStation 5, iOS, and Android. There is no news about whether it will come to Xbox Series X|S in the future, but it seems that with games similar to this, it takes a reasonably long time to consider. For example, Genshin Impact has been widely available for a few years now, with the PlayStation 5 version of the game being released in 2021. However, Genshin Impact is only now coming to Xbox Series X|S this month.</p>
<p><iframe title="Infinity Nikki Official Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ja4dbzntYMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is the fifth entry in the Nikki franchise and sees Nikki go on an expansive journey with her companion Momo, bringing the franchise to PC and PS5 for the first time ever. Infinity Nikki utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to get a vast degree of realism and sparkle to the game to bring it to life. This title is helmed by Kentaro Tominaga, a game industry veteran who worked on Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, bringing that same magical feel to Infinity Nikki. Players will get to explore a vibrant world with a ton of activities to take part in, such as fishing, pet grooming, and, of course, fashion contests. While fashion is typically the forefront of the game for the Nikki franchise, this title brings quests, a fun cast of characters to interact with, and lots of ways to platform and navigate the world to find little secrets scattered around Miraland.</p>
<p>To celebrate the official release date of Infinity Nikki, a brand-new trailer has been released, which showcases the full Infinity Nikki theme song Together Till Infinity for the first time ever. This song is performed by pop singer Jessie J, who is known for creating hits such as Price Tag, Domino, and Bang Bang.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-release-date-brings-post-nuclear-survival-in-march.1035807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced the release date for its post-apocalyptic survival-action game&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and the UK-set game is set to arrive on PC and consoles in spring next year.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/6491470391966433300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>arrives on March 27th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one, so if you're a subscriber, you'll get to check it out at no additional cost on Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Rather unusually, this one's coming to Xbox One and PS4 as well as current-gen machines, too. Let it never be said that Rebellion doesn't provide for those who are still attached to their last-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mstIcy2k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mURP-yNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should provide succor for those who feel underserved by more recent Bethesda&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fare.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic action-RPG inspired by real events but with a decidedly fictional bent.</p>

<p>The game is set five years after the very real Windscale nuclear disaster, a 1957 fire that caused radioactive material to leak from the eponymous Windscale nuclear site. In&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s universe, though, that disaster had much more far-reaching consequences than it did in real life.</p>

<p>As you explore&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s quarantine zone, you'll scavenge for resources, meet the locals, and contend with "bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies". In real life, of course, most of us Brits just apologized profusely, as is our wont.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which also gives a glimpse into the game's peculiarly British post-nuclear landscape (although it's not quite the blasted hellhole of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>or <em>Stalker</em>), right here.</p>




<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to use both ranged and melee weapons, but ammunition is scarce, so you'll have to blend firearms with melee weapons in order to create viable combat strategies.</p>

<p>If you're partial to the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>mod</a> or the British dystopian vibes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/we-happy-few" rel="nofollow"><em>We Happy Few</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should definitely be on your wishlist. The game is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007896" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on March 27th.</p>

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s developers have just revealed their future update plans for the game, which include new booster packs by the end of the year, trading for certain cards by January 2025, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1856819952713453683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post</a>, the developers first thanked everyone for playing Pokemon TCG Pocket, which has helped the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-crossed-30-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit some significant milestones</a>. They then explained the future update plans for the title, where they wish to add various in-game and a lot more content. </p>



<p>Here’s what the developers stated regarding what new content we should expect from Pokemon TCG Pocket’s future major update.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To begin with, we plan to add new booster packs by the end of the year. In addition, we are aiming to add a feature that allows certain cards to be traded starting in January, 2025. We are planning to gradually expand the selection of cards that are able to be traded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The game will receive new booster packs “by the end of the year”. Trading for certain cards will begin for Pokemon TCG Pocket in January 2025. The selection of cards that can be traded will be expanded gradually. We will have to wait and see what cards are tradable at launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the developers are working on some other new features, and more details will be revealed when the dates of these updates are finalised. The latest announcement is in line with a Pokemon TCG Pocket leak from days ago. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-leak-reveals-new-packs-an-expansion-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a> stated that a new booster pack will potentially arrive on December 16, which is near the “end of the year” window.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Much of the pre-launch discussion around Amazon's upcoming video game anthology show Secret Level has been occupied with fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-will-reportedly-remain-in-amazons-upcoming-secret-level-anthology-series-despite-recent-shutdown">it'll feature Concord</a>, despite the shooter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-unceremoniously-goes-offline-with-an-anticlimactic-error-message">abrupt end</a>; but there's plenty more to it than that, and Prime Video has now highlighted some of the other games - many radically reimagined - that'll feature when the show airs on 10th December.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level, of course, comes from Tim Miller and other creatives behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>’s sci-fi anthology series Love, Death &amp; Robots, and looks to take a similar approach to games. In total, it'll span 15 episodes, featuring Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, Pac-Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a>, Warhammer 40K, plus a number of PlayStation Studios games.
</p>
<p>
Amazon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">initial Secret Level trailer</a>, released back in August, featured around 90 seconds of blink-and-you'll-miss-it snippets from the series, getting across the vibes the show is aiming for if not much else. However, its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvY9Uq7I30Y">latest trailer</a> (seeming the finalised version of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-trailer-for-amazons-secret-level-reveals-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-keanu-reeves">work-in-progress trailer that leaked last month</a>) extends the runtime to a little under three minutes, offering a bit more context and a few more teases of things to come.

<p>
There's plenty of grit in there (probably a little too much, given half the clips are practically indistinguishable), but things get far more interesting when it comes to Secret Level's take on the games with considerably more distinct art styles - namely, the indie and retro titles in its line-up. Sifu, for instance, looks gorgeous, gently evolving the source material's painterly aesthetic, while Spelunky and Mega Man see far more dramatic departures. The latter, for example, has landed somewhere between Pixar and photo-realism in way that's almost certainly going to be divisive. And as for that glimpse of Pac-Man, it's the stuff of nightmares.
</p><p>
Elsewhere in Amazon's trailer, there's confirmation of Secret Level's previously leaked cast list. Keanu Reeves (who did actually pop up in the initial teaser, albeit briefly) will be joined by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, Ariana Greenblatt, Temuera Morrison, Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow, Gabriel Luna, Ricky Whittle, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Merle Dandridge, Claudia Doumit, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Clive Standen, Michael Beach, and Laura Bailey.
</p>
<p>
Secret Level creator Miller recently explained (in the same interview he said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">Concord's episode highlighted its world's "potential"</a>) the show will be split into two 'batches', the first covering the grittier stuff, while the latter is more family friendly. We also recently learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">Secret Level's Warhammer instalment is a sequel to Space Marine 2</a>.

		<p>Rebellion has confirmed the release date for its survival action game Atomfall, with that date being March 27th 2025. It has also been confirmed that Atomfall will be available on Xbox Game Pass day one. A brand new trailer to celebrate the release date of Atomfall has been released too, which has a specially composed song for it.</p>

<p>Set in the North of England in the 1960s, the game’s story branches off from reality following the Windscale fire, the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history at the nuclear plant now known as Sellafield. Following the fallout from the fire, the surrounding area has been put into quarantine, a grand coverup, it seems, for some other mysterious events. The whole quarantine zone has fallen into decay, with crashed helicopters and rusted out cars, while the locals in Windham village are monitored by Protocol – a military group sent in to manage the rescue and help operation. They come with more modern weaponry, and have towering 1950s sci-fi style robots equipped with machine guns and flamethrowers to keep order and patrol both the village and abandoned underground bunkers of BARD – locations key to unpeeling the mystery of the game’s world.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now live for both the standard edition of Atomfall and the Deluxe Edition. The Deluxe Edition will include the base game, three days early access, a basic supply bundle, an enhanced supply bundle, and access to the first story expansion which will launch at a later date. No details have yet been released about the content of the story expansion. The standard edition is priced at £44.99 while the Atomfall Deluxe Edition is priced at £64.99. Those who pre-order the standard edition will also get the basic supply bundle.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4.</p>

			<p>Today, Orbifold Studios has released a new Half-Life 2 RTX trailer to celebrate the coming twentieth anniversary since Valve launched the masterpiece sci-fi first-person shooter sequel.</p>
<p>As you probably already know if you've read our previous coverage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-is-in-development-by-a-group-of-modders-will-support-ray-tracing-dlss-3-rtx-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX</a>, this is a remastering project that leverages the technologies of NVIDIA's RTX Remix and has the blessing of the original developer, Valve. Orbifold Studios, a team of experienced modders, was founded specifically to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p>In this video, Project Lead Wormslayer says:</p>
<p><em>Half-Life 2 is my favorite game. It's something I've been playing for over 20 years now. It was unlike any other game I'd played before. the whole game is packed with memorable experiences: stepping off the train for the first time and walking up that platform and seeing Dr Breen appear on the giant screen above you. The gameplay and the storytelling still stand up incredibly well, but we just wanted to recapture that sense of awe that we all had 20 years ago playing it for the first time. </em><em>RTX remix is the core of our remastering process. The original engine has very hard limits.</em></p>
<p><em>In Half-Life 2 RTX, we have fully ray traced reflections and refractions on water and glass and volumetric fog with cool lighting and shadows. We actually have full 3D detail in there, and it's all self-shadowing and reflecting, and it looks pretty stunning.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2 RTX | Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Tribute Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FZ49Ou8zAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the video isn't meant to share any kind of estimate on when we'll actually be able to play the remaster. As the developers point out, there are lots of assets to remaster, and despite the presence of over a hundred contributors, the team is still recruiting. If you think you can help bring Half-Life 2 RTX to life, fill out the form available on the official <a href="https://www.hl2rtx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio Thunderful has announced another round of layoffs in a further "strategic restructuring program" that's set to affect dozens of employees, mostly focused across the company's development divisions.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/thunderful-doubling-down-on-game-publishing-scaling-back-internal-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on its official website</a>, Thunderful says these layoffs are intended to reflect "a greater focus on third-party game publishing and a reduction in investments in internally-developed projects".</p>

<p>Company CEO Martin Walfisz says announcing Thunderful's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">second "restructuring" wave this year</a> is "unfortunate", but that the company "see[s] no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability".</p>

<p>Between 80 and 100 employees will be affected by these layoffs. Thunderful says that its subsidiary Coatsink won't be in the firing line, but it seems like the company's other development divisions are all in the crosshairs, so to speak.</p>

<p>News of Thunderful's second layoff wave this year follows on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Stage Clear Studios</a> back in May, at which point Thunderful also reported a 28% drop in revenue on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<p>While Thunderful hasn't released official sales figures for its recent game launches, we do know that city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thunderful-says-steamworld-build-underperformed-reveals-it-s-looking-to-sell-headup" rel="nofollow">fell short of company expectations</a>, and it seems the release of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2&nbsp;</em>earlier this year wasn't enough to recover things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=2l9OONUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=Cs_cjM5e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upcoming Thunderful releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderful's news post doesn't make any suggestion that the company will be canceling upcoming releases, so you can expect recently-announced projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">the roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>to go ahead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderful isn't the only company being subjected to what companies would likely call "challenging market conditions" in recent times.</p>

<p>Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are also being hit by layoffs and studio closures, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a> aren't escaping unscathed either. These are truly difficult times for the gaming industry, it seems, although of course, that's not stopping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">C-suite execs</a> reaping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">rewards galore</a>.</p>

<li>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapons</h4>



<p>Throughout the pre-season we have seen a steady and healthy variety of weapon usage. Most weapons sit quite closely in both performance and pick rate, with no weapons dominating in both areas. As such our first round of Season 01 tuning changes will not be introducing any major shifts to the current state of weapon balance, and instead focus on elevating some of the weapons at the bottom of the pack. We are also addressing feedback regarding Assault Rifle damage in Hardcore and completing our adjustments to the shotgun slug attachment.</p>



<p>Reminder: We’re using a new Weapon Damage Adjustments tables to identify post-patch damage changes when possible. Need an explainer?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes#explainweapondamagetables">Click here!</a></p>



<h5>All Weapons</h5>



<ul>
<li>Adjusted weapon motion while moving and changing stances to improve aiming feel and centering (especially with optics).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Hold Breath focus state will now be maintained while firing if applicable.</li>



<li>Improved Weapon depth of field settings when performing a Weapon Inspect.</li>
</ul>



<h5>Assault Rifles&nbsp;</h5>



<ul>
<li>We are increasing the damage values for some of our Assault Rifles to ensure that they kill in just one bullet in Hardcore modes. The headshot multiplier changes have either kept the bullets to kill with headshots the same or even improved them at some Min Damage Ranges.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-zombies">Zombies</h3>



<h4>Maps&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li><strong>Terminus&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where defuse progress was sometimes not saved if the player stopped defusing during the Apocalypse Protocol Main Quest step.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where entering a Kazimir after completing the Main Quest would teleport the player to the boss arena and down them.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where loading into a saved game after unlocking the Pack-A-Punch machine could cause some doors to have inconsistent collision.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue during the Main Quest where connecting both Node Connectors at the same time would cause overlapping voice lines.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Changed the location of the Ammo Cache on the Seaside Path.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Liberty Falls&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Updated the first Mangler whose arm is blown off to always drop a Mangler Cannon instead of only the first Mangler that spawns.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Resolved an issue where Blanchard would not be present during some dialogue.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Weapon Adjustments&nbsp;</h4>



<p>The recent changes to Assault Rifles in Zombies were an unintended carryover from a global weapon tuning pass. We do not intend to inherit all MP weapon tuning without looking at how it affects Zombies tuning as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have corrected this in this update, while also making a pass on increasing the damage performance of ARs in Zombies. All ARs have had their Pack-a-Punched base damage and overall critical damage increased. While you may see the word “decreased” in a few places, the performance for these weapons is still increased overall!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, the HE-1 Launcher has gotten a buff to become more useful at stopping hordes of zombies. When Pack-a-Punched, it will now have more stock ammo and a larger explosion with more overall damage.&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Bug Fixes&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where camos were not being applied to Zombie Builds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to have 3 weapons.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wallbuy rarity would reset when loading into a save.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Elemental Pop&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Elemental Pop would prevent normal Ammo Mod activations.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Jugger-nog&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell Augment
<ul>
<li>Turtle Shell will now apply damage mitigation when being grabbed by an Amalgam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>PHD Flopper&nbsp;</strong>
<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where diving onto an elevated or inclined surface, such as stairs or up a hill, would not activate the perk.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where rarely the round would not end after killing all zombies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where the Amalgam could grab the player while slowed.&nbsp;</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<h4>Challenges&nbsp;</h4>



<ul>
<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Wall Buys would not progress the Prestige 8 Challenge Value Town.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Addressed&nbsp;an issue where Legendary GobbleGums would progress the Ultra Prestige 8 Challenge Full Power instead of Ultra GobbleGums.&nbsp;</li>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-100-hours-complete-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Haert of Chornobyl</a> arrives on November 20, marking the epic and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-gone-gold-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly anticipated</a> sequel to Stalker: Call of Pripyat. It’s one of the most exciting releases of 2024, arriving just in time before the end of the year.</p>



<p>The game brings an eerie atmosphere of unsettling survival, where ammo and resources are limited. Many are looking forward to taking on the challenge, but some are wondering if Stalker 2 will be available on PS5.</p>



<p>Here’s everything you need to know about whether Stalker 2 will be available on PlayStation.</p>

<p>The previous title, Call of Pripyat, was available on PlayStation 4, so there’s a chance that the game could eventually make its way over to PlayStation. However, there are no details regarding Stalker 2 making its way to Sony’s console just yet. </p>



<p>Many Xbox exclusive titles have eventually made their way to PlayStation such as Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Hi-Fi Rush, so perhaps Stalker 2 will follow a similar trajectory and make its way to PS5 somewhere down the line.</p>
