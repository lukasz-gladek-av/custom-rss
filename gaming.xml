<p>An Intelligent Systems top-down adventure also on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We now know the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">launch line-up</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> service, coming to Nintendo Switch Online on <strong>17th February 2026</strong>. And while it's all worth getting excited over, there are two never-before-released games coming out later in the year that Nintendo enthusiasts should be particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Right at the end of the brand new overview trailer (at around <a href="https://youtu.be/nVvaCe4esCQ?si=QQAHZqkIL2PYIKMw&amp;t=187" data-yt-videoid="nVvaCe4esCQ" data-yt-start="187">3:07</a>), Nintendo showed off footage from two cancelled Virtual Boy games that will be playable for the first time ever via Nintendo Switch Online — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a> (also known as Dragon Hopper). Both of these will be coming to the service sometime in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Zero Racers a pretty big deal for long-time Nintendo fans — this is a cancelled <strong>F-Zero</strong> spin-off that was apparently shown off at E3 1996, but was cancelled due to the failure of the Virtual Boy. A few years ago, a former Nintendo of America localiser said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/mythical-virtual-boy-f-zero-spin-off-was-100percent-complete-according-to-former-noa-staffer">the game "was done"</a> (as in complete), and this release seems to confirm that.</p>

<p>The latter game, D-Hopper, is from Intelligent Systems, who we know best for developing the <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games. D-Hopper is very much its own thing, and was also playable at E3 1996 — it's a top-down adventure game where you have to adventure through maze-like maps and fight enemies in order to rescue your girlfriend. A little Zelda-esque, perhaps?</p>
<p>Both of these games are fantastic additions to the service, and we're excited to check them out for the first time ever later in the year. The Virtual Boy might not be well-loved, but it's got an eclectic library of games and spin-offs.</p>
<p>The launch line-up is pretty solid too, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Wario Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3D Tetris</a> all part of the package day-one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/steam-operator-valve-faces-a-656m-class-action-lawsuit-over-its-excessive-30-cut-of-all-steam-sales/</link>
            <guid>1417480</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valve,</strong> the studio that was once known for making world-class games like <strong>Half-Life</strong> and <strong>Left 4 Dead</strong>, but is lately simply known as the people behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">Steam</a></strong> and hardware like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-is-already-planned-confirms-gabe-newell/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-just-works-steam-machine-verified-badge-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-verification-to-no-ones-surprise/">Steam Machine</a></strong>, is facing a similar ire to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Apple</strong> faced in its legal bout with <strong>Epic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <strong><a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf">London Competition Appeal Tribunal</a></strong> has declared that Valve must face a massive <strong>£656 million class-action lawsuit</strong>, arguing that the company takes an "<em><strong>excessive</strong></em>" <strong>30% revenue cut</strong> of every transaction made on Steam.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-to-face-uk-class-action-lawsuit-with-proposed-damages-of-656m">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/">Reuters</a>), this lawsuit initially began with <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>Parent Zone</strong>, filing the suit in 2024. At the time, Shotbolt said, "<em>Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>," and that she filed the claim in an attempt "<em>to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed</em>."</p>



<p>The suit represents some <strong>14 million UK gamers</strong>, as it claims that the 30% commission Valve takes on every purchase is "<em>Imposing <strong>excessive commission charges</strong> which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers</em>." It also claims that Valve utilizes "<em>anti-steering provisions</em>," which amount to tactics used by Valve to keep customers on Steam, exemplified by the fact that when you purchase a game on Steam, you must also purchase any DLC or add-on content on Steam to use said content.</p>



<p>If some of this, namely the claim that Valve's 30% cut is "<em>excessive</em>," feels familiar to you, that's because back in 2021, <strong>Wolfire Studios</strong> and <strong>Dark Catt Studios</strong> filed a similar case against Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Wolfire was the first to file its suit back in April 2021</a>, which also pinned the same claim against <strong>Sony</strong> with regard to the <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>. Dark Catt Studios filed its suit months later in June 2021, with Wolfire's suit ultimately being dismissed, and only some of the claims made by Dark Catt Studios getting tossed out.</p>



<p>While Dark Catt's suit continued, Wolfire reorganized its arguments and re-filed its suit against Valve. Due to the cases being so similar, they were combined in July 2022, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/">then in November 2024, the combined suit was given class-action status</a>.</p>



<p>Suits like this always take a while to reach a conclusion, so don't hold your breath on this making an impact on the video game industry anytime soon. That said, the potential ramifications of Valve losing a suit like this are monumental and cannot be understated. A Valve loss might even mean that company head<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/"> <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> needs to cut back on his <strong>super yacht budget</strong></a>.</p>

Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501</link>
            <guid>1417468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been less than a week since Ubisoft announced it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>cancelling several projects</span></a><span>, including the long-awaited </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake. That project had apparently been struggling since its 2020 announcement, having essentially started over from scratch </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554"><span>back in 2023</span></a><span>. But while the remake itself may never see the light of day, some concept art and screenshots from the game’s 2024 pre-alpha version have started circulating online. Ubisoft, however, is doing its best to get them taken down before anyone can see what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>The art and images are from a 2024 workshop presentation, and though they don’t show the game in motion, there’s enough here to get a sense of what the team at Ubisoft was working toward before the project was canceled. The presentation was posted to YouTube, then subsequently copyright-struck by Ubisoft. Fans still managed to grab the images, though, and have been sharing them across social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p> <p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p> <p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p> <p>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>From the sound of it, the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake was even further along by the time it was canceled earlier this month, as Eman Ayaz, an actor who has hinted she was playing a role in the game, had shot a marketing promo for the game just two months prior.</span></p> <p><span>“I pushed myself past old limits and discovered things I didn’t even know existed inside of me through the lives that I lived in this character,” Ayaz </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak"><span>says in a YouTube video</span></a><span>. “It was something that’s completely out of the range of any character that I’ve been cast in in the past. And I got to do things I’ve never gotten to do before. And it brought out what I honestly believe is the best performance of my career. And now nobody is ever going to see that. I can’t stress enough how much I had kind of planned my life around the release of this project.”</span></p>

  <p><span>While the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake is probably the most high-profile cancellation at Ubisoft this month, the company shelved five other games and delayed seven more as part of a larger restructuring. Don’t worry though,</span><i><span> Beyond Good and Evil 2 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><span>is still coming</span></a><span>. </span></p>

Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p><p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p><p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p><p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p><p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p><p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Fixes to Player Controls<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie <a title="Companies > Dodge Roll [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/dodge-roll">Dodge Roll</a> from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li></ul></li><li>Fixes to Multiplayer<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/splatoon-3-version-11-0-0-update-launches-january-29]]></content:encoded>

<header><section>
<p>Two previously unreleased games are also coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Those of you excited to relive the glory days of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> only have a few more weeks to wait until you can play them on Nintendo Switch Online on Switch 1 and Switch 2. <strong>17th February</strong> is approaching fast!</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo has dropped a brand new trailer confirming the launch line-up for the new service along with a handful of features and surprises.</p>
<p>Seven games will be available from the jump, with more to be added "in the future". As per usual, then. Here's all the games you'll be able to play from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/galactic_pinball">Galactic Pinball</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3-D TETRIS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/innsmouth_no_yakata">The Mansion of Innsmouth</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>A pretty healthy starting line-up, if we do say so ourselves. Wario Land felt like a day-one given, as did 3-D Tetris. Of course, more are coming in the future, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario's Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/jack_bros">Jack Bros.</a>, and two never-before-released games in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D(ragon)-Hopper</a>.</p>
<p>To play Virtual Boy games, you'll need to grab the Virtual Boy accessory for your console; either the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">standard one</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">cardboard version</a> will do.</p>
<p>Other features available on the service include the ability to Rewind gameplay, make save states, check and remap controls, and — later in the year — change the colour of the screen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced Siege Breakers, the latest Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and this one's all about big, loud explosions, which are, as I'm sure we can all agree, the ideal way to spread democracy throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In many ways, Siege Breakers provides the perfect counterpoint to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="460a9d06-01c8-4dde-8dcd-17b098a9a0f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Redacted Regiment</a>, the Warbond from a couple of weeks ago, because that one focused on stealth and this one...absolutely does not.</p><p>The first major addition to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in Siege Breakers is the LAS-16 Trident, an updated version of the beloved weapon from the original arsenal. This one fires six beams instead of three, and when it comes to annihilating enemies, that's definitely a marked improvement.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Siege Breakers brings new weapons like this laser-focused bad boy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you prefer to get up close and personal (well, even more up close and personal), then the new CQC-20 Breaching Hammer stratagem will allow you to do just that. It's a massive sledgehammer that can optionally also explode. I say "optionally", but that sounds pretty mandatory to me.</p><p>Joining the new hammer is the GL-28 Belt-Fed Grenade Launcher, which, as the name suggests, is an explosive weapon that lets you continuously fire grenades. It should be perfect for those pesky Terminid hives.</p><p>Should you prefer to make one very loud noise rather than a series of slightly less loud noises, you may want to check out the EAT-411 Leveller, a single-shot missile launcher with a serious kick.</p><p>Lastly, if all of this ordnance isn't working for you and you need to protect yourself, the G/SH-39 Shield should help you do just that by providing a barrier that should stop more than a few Automaton shots.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, coming in addition to new armors, capes, and other accouterments to help your Helldiver stand out and look snazzy on the battlefield.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Siege Breakers Warbond launches across all platforms on February 3rd.

              <p>The LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure is a 412-piece kit that lets you turn the iconic yellow canary into a heart-inspired display you can pose and change up. Once you have completed the figure and used the posable head, wings, tail, and feet, you can choose to either position Tweety on the pedestal, cloud, as a matchmaker, or by removing Tweety from the base, placing the bouquet under his arm, and attaching the heart above his head so he appears to be providing a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">You can go to Amazon and purchase the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure for $24, which is $11 cheaper than the original retail price of $35, and a 31% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A LEGO project featuring the Looney Tunes’ most iconic bird</h2>
<p>This Valentine-themed build of Tweety offers a couple of obvious options to style the figure so it continues to interest you after you finish the build. First, you can put Tweety on the pedestal cloud, place the bow and arrow within his wings, and create a fun playfulness by posing Tweety as Cupid to fit in with Valentine’s Day on a nightstand or desk. Second, when you want to tone things down a bit, you can take Tweety off the pedestal, give him the bouquet, and place the heart on top of his head so he looks like the giver.</p>
<p>The use of posable joints allows the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure to appear more lively than a fixed decoration that never changes position. Additionally, since the model is made from LEGO elements, you can move some pieces around if you would like to slightly change how he looks or stands, without using a specialized tool or additional components.</p>



<p>The design features and functionality of this set also enable it to serve a dual purpose as a decorative item rather than simply a one-time build that you throw in storage. The pedestal is compact, so the space required for this item will be small enough to fit on a dresser corner, a bookshelf, or an office shelf.</p>
<p>The step-by-step instructions for building the model are intended to create a fun, satisfying experience as each part goes into place. The directions start by showing you how to form the body and head of Tweety, and then proceed to the pedestal and accessories so that you see the character develop in stages. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">Once the figure is placed on display, you have a charming Looney Tunes figure that you can re-position as many times as you desire, and given the fact that the item is available for $24 on sale, down from the normal $35</a>, it makes for a simple and affordable little project that’s worth building.</p>

              <p><span>Not even the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> community is safe from AI ensloppification.</span></p> <p><span>With the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update</span></a><span> only a few weeks old, players have been hard at work sprucing up their islands and posting pictures of all their hard decorating work. But some have been using generative AI to “enhance” their photos or fabricate them altogether, and fans are getting pissed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sharing stylistic edits of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> screenshots online is a foundational pillar of the game’s community. Photos are typically edited to enhance the game’s lighting and shadows, or put through filters to achieve a certain vibe. Photos with the best vibes are rewarded with likes, upvotes, or whatever the clout currency is for a particular social media website. However, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ai-slop-aesthetic/"><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span> that on X and elsewhere, </span><i><span>AC </span></i><span>screenshots enhanced with AI have started trending, often without disclosure that genAI was used.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it’s time we talk about the AI use in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>aesthetic posts that are trending,” </span><a href="https://x.com/cozyberru/status/2015462841139314792?s=20"><span>wrote user Cozyberru on X</span></a><span>. In a thread, they highlight how a number of recently trending&nbsp;<em>AC</em> screenshots were likely created with genAI, pointing out the usual suspects of funky-looking numbers and warped textures on background items. But their issue isn’t so much with using the tool itself. “All I am asking is to be honest and disclose your use of AI or editing,” they wrote.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> has thousands of little knick-knacks, pieces of furniture, and more. Not sharing that an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> photo has been enhanced with AI can lead to confusion in players who might want to get their hands on something they don’t know has been wholly made up.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the thread, one commenter </span><a href="https://x.com/salFreeApps/status/2015536285998625106?s=20"><span>thanked Cozyberru for their service</span></a><span>. “I’ve been sitting here thinking, ‘is there a mod or hack or glitch going around that I don’t know?’ Because there’s no way to place that item that close to the furniture as much as I want to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Cozyberru doesn’t explicitly share their feelings about genAI, but others shared theirs in the thread’s comments and elsewhere online. Though it’s not called out specifically in the rules, it seems the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> subreddit has a strict “No genAI policy.” In a post regarding fanart, a moderator advised community members not to report anything that wasn’t </span><span>“</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1q4powt/please_stop_reporting_art_posts_as_low_quality/"><span>blatantly NSFW or AI.</span></a><span>”</span><span>&nbsp;In another post, a user reposted a video of their island after the original was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qaz4ms/nearly_3000_hours_and_35_years_later_my_island_is/"><span>taken down for using text-to-speech AI voiceover</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘We’re Next to Go’ – Why Ubisoft’s ‘Creative Network’ Employees Fear Imminent Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-creative-network/</link>
            <guid>1417414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a week since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> announced its massive restructuring, which saw six projects cancelled, seven titles delayed, and two studios closed. The company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stock price dropped to a 15-year low</a>, a 95% decline from its peak valuation. </p>



<p>The company’s announcement revolved around its new ‘Creative Houses’ structure, which will see its IPs placed into five different categories, organized around distinct genres and franchises. As announced by Ubisoft, each Creative House will have its own leadership structure and will be responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction for that particular Creative House.</p>







<p>A ‘Creative Network’ of studios will strengthen these Creative Houses, providing technical support, QA, and other development resources. It’s a change that Ubisoft say will bring more structure, speedy game development, and the ability to deploy technical resources across its portfolio. </p>



<p>It’s yet another change enforced at the publisher that has made employees feel uneasy. Some tell me that they feel like this is just a way to eventually sell off their IPs, while others theorise it’s a means to get cash injections into creating more subsidiaries with other companies more easily. Very few think that’s a meaningful change that will make much of a difference because, at the end of the day, it’s still the same people in charge who put the company is this place in the first place.</p>



<h2 id="h-creative-network-employees-are-worried">Creative Network Employees Are Worried</h2>



<p>For the most part, and understandably so, most employees who currently work at Ubisoft are frustrated, confused, and worried about the future. Ubisoft’s third, and apparently final, cost-cutting measure will aim to save another 200 million euros by March 2028, a move that could result in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of developers being laid off.</a> But the most noticeable of the worried employees come from Ubisoft’s new ‘Creative Network’, who tell me that the restructuring feels like it only applies to half of the company and suggests that they are easy targets for future layoffs.</p>



<p>That’s because, while not released to the public, Ubisoft has already outlined and assigned studios to each Creative House and the Creative Network, with around 20 studios now in the Creative Network. But internally, nothing has been set in stone or assigned regarding how they will assist the Houses.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has been sent documentation outlining which Ubisoft Studios will go to which Creative House.</p>







<h3 id="h-creative-house-1-vantage-studios">Creative House 1 (Vantage Studios)</h3>



<p><strong>Games </strong>– Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Barcelona, Montreal Vantage, Quedec, Saguenay, Sherbrooke, Sofia</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-2">Creative House 2</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, The Division, Avatar</p>



<p><strong>Studios </strong>– Paris (Ghost Recon), Massive, Montreal CH2, Toronto</p>



<p><em>Avatar was missing from the publicly released documents. When asked for comment about the future of Avatar, a Ubisoft spokesperson told Insider Gaming, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a live game with internal teams working on it.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-3">Creative House 3</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Brawlhalla, For Honor, Riders Republic, Skull &amp; Bones, The Crew</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Blue Mammoth Games, Ivory Tower, Montreal CH3</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-4">Creative House 4</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Anno, Beyond Good and Evil, Might &amp; Magic, Prince of Persia, Rayman, Trackmania</p>



<p><strong>Studios – </strong>Mainz, Milan, Montepellier, Montreal CH4, Nadeo</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-5">Creative House 5</h3>



<div><p><strong>Games – </strong>Growtopia, Hasbro Games, Howrse, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Glode, Just Dance, Kolibri’s portfolio, Ketchapp’s portfolio, UNO</p><p><strong>Studios –</strong> Abu Dhabi, Barcelona Mobile, Ketchapp, Kolibrio Games, Paris (Just Dance), Ubisoft Mobile Games, Ubisoft Paris Mobile</p></div>



<p><em>Ubisoft also has four unannounced IP’s in development, which will fall into Creative House 2, 3, or 4, depending on the IP’s theme.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-network">Creative Network</h3>



<p>The following studios are all within the Creative Network:</p>



<ul>
<li>Annecy</li>



<li>Belgrade</li>



<li>Berlin</li>



<li>Bordeaux</li>



<li>Bucharest</li>



<li>Chengdu</li>



<li>Da Nang</li>



<li>Dusseldorf</li>



<li>Kyiv</li>



<li>Odesa</li>



<li>Warsaw</li>



<li>Manila</li>



<li>Paris</li>



<li>Pune</li>



<li>Red Storm</li>



<li>RedLynx</li>



<li>Reflections</li>



<li>Shanghai</li>



<li>Singapore</li>



<li>Winnipeg</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-darker-days-to-come">Darker Days to Come</h2>



<p>It’s unfortunate to say, but despite an insane amount of good IPs and games to hopefully come, it still feels like Ubisoft’s darkest days aren’t yet over. Officially, it’ll be March 2028 before the cost-cutting will stop, but it feels like Ubisoft’s rollercoaster story of twists and turns are only just beginning.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, and even before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 jobs at Ubisoft Paris’ headquarters</a>, a move that has seen the French <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft unions propose a strike from February 10-12</a>. </p>



<p>The unfortunate thing about all this is that, as always, it will be the developers who suffer the conseqeven before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters, a move that has prompted the French Ubisoft unions touences of years of misleadership. </p>

<p>The French Ubisoft unions have unanimously agreed to organize a strike against the company between February 10 and 12, 2026.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft recently announced a major restructure to the organisation, which would lead to multiple studio closures and layoffs. The first set of dismissals has already been revealed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 job cuts proposed</a> at the Paris Headquarters. The French unions have agreed to strike and are coordinating with international counterparts. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-strike-to-take-place-this-february">Ubisoft Strike to Take Place this February </h2>



<p>According to a report by the French publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Les Echos</a>, several unions representing Ubisoft workers—namely the Video Game Workers’ Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps Écologique—have unanimously agreed to strike from February 10 to 12. The unions also plan to collaborate with their international counterparts to raise awareness of the situation on a global scale.</p>



<p>The reason for the strike is the new austerity measures aimed at reducing the company’s fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years, along with&nbsp;stricter remote working conditions. This decision is expected to result in layoffs, with the first voluntary mutual termination already proposed. The layoffs could affect 20% of Ubisoft’s headquarters workforce and 5% of its total workforce in France.</p>



<p>The Ubisoft restructure has already led to the cancellation of the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will focus on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 creative houses</a>. The restructuring has already led to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major decline in the company’s share price</a>. </p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> will be four years old later this year, and despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-end-of-splatoon-3-regular-updates">Nintendo ending regular update plans</a> in late 2024 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-raiders-announced-for-switch-2-plus-a-chonky-splatoon-3-update-incoming">Splatoon Raiders</a> being deep into development, we're still getting new content and gameplay patches.</p>
<p>Last summer's 10.0.0 update enhanced the game with new weapon kits, an extra map, and plenty of tweaks and smaller additions. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> owners got a resolution increase and rock-solid framerates. Ahead of Raiders, it felt like the perfect farewell to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and a way to solidify its continued online domination on Switch consoles until a fourth game hits, as it sounds like the spinoff's priorities are PvE-oriented.</p>
<p>Today, 27th January, we've been surprised by yet another major patch coming to Splatoon 3 as soon as this week. The meta-shaking <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html">11.0.0 update</a> drops on 29th January, so plan your weekend accordingly.</p>
<p>The "meta-shaking" bit isn't a joke or an exaggeration. While it doesn't add new content to the jumbo-sized threequel, it changes and expands the gameplay significantly with tweaks and even an all-new mechanic: Flow Aura.</p>
<p>"Inklings and Octolings who splat multiple opponents in quick succession will enter a new state called Flow Aura," the official post explains. This multi-frag boost of sorts goes on for longer than 30 seconds if you splat more opponents and/or assist teammates. During this period, ink bursts around the player and speed, resistance, and "intensify actions" receive enhancements. This will no doubt encourage more aggressive play styles across the board, perhaps in an attempt by the devs to minimize the impact of campers and cheap opportunist strategies, further pushing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> into the classical "arena shooter" space.</p><p>Another massive addition is that of a Stealth Jump gear ability which "allows players to jump to their teammates without the opposing team necessarily seeing where they will land." As a way to offset its massive potential, the developers have increased the flight time for this type of respawn jump.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Last but not least, health bars will now be shown above damaged players, but not when they're behind cover or diving into ink. While this has been a common bit of most online team-based shooters for years, Splatoon only indicated the damage sustained by other players with the amount of ink covering them. Coupled with smaller hit boxes for Inklings and Octolings when in "swim form" (as well as adjustments to weapons' own hit boxes), combat encounters might change in a big way come Thursday. Getting behind cover and swimming away from danger will be more important than ever before.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes (complete with stat changes) <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html">here</a>. More updates for Splatoon 3 might also arrive in the near future, since a native Switch 2 version with further improvements <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-has-now-been-rated-for-the-switch-2">may be arriving soon</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-out-now-dynamic-fx-classic-pc-games/</link>
            <guid>1417384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As promised by <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, the new <strong>RTX Remix Logic</strong> feature is now publicly available via an update released for the <strong>NVIDIA app</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-soon-add-dynamic-fx-responds-to-in-game-events/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced earlier this month at <strong>CES 2026</strong></a> for a late January release, RTX Remix Logic enables modders to <strong>dynamically trigger graphics effects in direct response to real-time in-game events</strong>. Critically, it achieves this without requiring source code or engine access, which would otherwise make it a dealbreaker in most cases.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says there are <strong>over 30 in-game events</strong> that can be triggered, such as:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="left">Event Category</th><th data-align="left">Examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Player state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Camera position, camera zoom, player world coordinates</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>World bounding boxes</strong></td><td data-align="left">Indoor/outdoor detection, region-specific triggers</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Object state</strong></td><td data-align="left">Any tracked object's position, visibility, and proximity to the player</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Time flow</strong></td><td data-align="left">In-game time of day, elapsed real-time</td></tr><tr><td data-align="left"><strong>Input</strong></td><td data-align="left">Specific key presses by the player</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p> These triggers can manipulate <strong>over 900 RTX Remix graphics parameters</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lighting conditions (time of day, color temperature, intensity)</li>



<li>Weather systems (rain, snow, fog density, volumetric effects)</li>



<li>Material properties (displacement, reflectivity, emissiveness)</li>



<li>Post-processing effects (chromatic aberration, bloom, vignette)</li>



<li>Path-traced volumetrics (smoke, atmospheric scattering)</li>
</ul>



<p>You won't even need to be a professional coder to add RTX Remix Logic to your mods. <strong>NVIDIA has introduced an accessible, no-code node-based interface</strong> where modders can easily drag-and-drop nodes representing triggers and actions, connect cause and effect relationships visually, fine-tune parameters with dedicated sliders and dropdowns, and finally preview all the changes they've made in real time within the Remix editor. More crafty RTX Remix modders will even be able to <strong>create and share custom event triggers</strong>, and new action nodes can be added via plugins, making the framework heavily extensible.</p>



<p>NVIDIA's demo was created in <strong>Half-Life 2 RTX</strong>, where RTX Remix Logic can trigger a '<strong>Ravenholm multiverse</strong>' whenever the player opens a specific door, as shown below. There are many RTX Remix mods in development (<a href="https://wccftech.com/clive-barkers-undying-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reported a new one for <strong>Clive Barker's Undying</strong> just yesterday</a>); it will be interesting to see which modders decide to add this new system to their mod projects. According to NVIDIA, RTX Remix Logic can be added to <strong>over 165 classic PC games</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Today, NVIDIA also shared a small update on new games that support its DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) set of technologies. <strong>Half Sword</strong>, a physics-based medieval combat simulator scheduled to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> this Friday, will debut with built-in support for <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong> with the option to upgrade <strong>Super Resolution</strong> to the second-generation <strong>DLSS 4.5</strong> transformer model via the NVIDIA app.</p>



<p><strong>Code Vein II</strong>, which is out now in advanced access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-ii-ps5-review-bonds-across-time-and-wasted-space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find our review here</a>), supports DLSS Super Resolution. The same goes for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newly released free-to-play PvP raid shooter <strong>Highguard</strong></a>, in which GeForce RTX owners can also upgrade Super Resolution to DLSS 4.5 via the app.</p>

            <p>Quick confession: every time I come up with an absolute Frankenstein’s cocktail of allusion-cobbling Google-bait like the headline for this article, a fairy dies. But that’s OK, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-express">Hell Express</a> is a top-down 3D extraction shooter about delivering letters to the dead. When I play it – there’s no release date yet – I will convey a note of apology to the soul of the fairy I’ve just slain with my appalling SEO practices. This may be difficult, however, because many of the underworld’s denizens are hostile. The only thing you’ll be delivering to them is bullets, fire and explosives.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Hell Express is a PvE isometric extraction shooter for 1-4 players, blending heart-pounding combat, high-risk treasure hunts, and strategic resource management in a world teetering between life and death,” explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564490/Hell_Express/">the Steam page</a>. “As a member of Hell Express—an armed delivery company that sends delivery to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>—you'll choose from a diverse cast of characters, each with unique abilities and personal motives. Dive into the perilous depths of Limbo, complete dangerous deliveries, and scavenge for treasures to upgrade your gear and vehicles. But beware: every decision could mean the difference between survival and ruin.”</p>

<p>Further down the page they call it a "road trip", with a "Hell Trakker" van you can equip with flamethrowers. There are glimpses of the extraction mechanics, too, with a squad of players holding the line against boglins while hauling somebody's KO'd ass to the van. Still, I think I prefer what I've seen of the stealthy interior stretches. I hope it scrubs up well as a solo play - I don't need any co-op partners trampling on my atmosphere of mounting trepidation. Go watch the van, why don't you.</p><p>Hell Express was announced last year, and developers Full Metal Bagel Games have just signed up with Arc Games as publisher. Arc Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-neverwinter-and-star-trek-online-devs-cryptic-allowing-them-to-gather-their-party-and-boldly-go-where-saber-went-before">used to be part of Embracer</a>, before Embracer fell into a giant, self-dug hole of layoffs and restructuring. They and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-online">Star Trek Online</a> developers Cryptic are now part of Project Golden Arc, an operation run by members of the Arc Games management team with funding from XD Inc. </p>
<p>As for Full Metal Bagel, they apparently include “industry veterans who’ve worked on highly acclaimed titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last of Us Part II</a>, Assassin’s Creed Origins, Honor of Kings, and more.” As ever with these things, it’s unclear whether “veterans” here means people whose contributions to those games were significant enough to imply anything substantial about the game they're making now.</p>
<p>A quick LinkedIn trawl reveals that Full Metal Bagel’s art director is Keyi Li, who was a senior concept artist at Ubisoft and Tencent. I do like the art direction of Hell Express. There’s an enticing balance of crisp military tech, convoluted and decayed layouts, and paranormal fixtures or interruptions. Did you see the queue of petrified people by the derelict bus in the announcement trailer? I thought that was one of the better queues of petrified people I’ve seen in a game – probably, one of my top three.</p>

<p>Look out for a Hell Express playtest this spring. If you’re keen on such dreary, darkling spectacles, you might also like End Of Abyss, which I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/end-of-abyss-is-a-dark-soulsy-shooter-spawned-from-the-bowels-of-little-nightmares">sampled at SGF last year</a>. A fairy probably died for that headline, too.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-ryzen-7-mini-pc-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-drops-to-its-lowest-price-and-is-selling-fast-as-a-mac-mini-alternative-2000663260</link>
            <guid>1417366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space is a luxury these days, especially for people working from home or studying in smaller apartments. A full-size tower PC can feel excessive when all you really need is reliable performance which you can get from something more compact. Mini PCs solve that problem neatly, and the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a strong example of how much power can fit into a surprisingly small box. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/">Right now, it’s also much cheaper than usual, thanks to Amazon discounts that shave as much as $240 off select configurations.</a></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is its size. It’s compact enough to sit unobtrusively on a desk, tuck onto a shelf, or mount behind a monitor. It works for students, professionals, or really anyone building a clean, minimalist workspace.</p>
<p>ACEMAGIC is offering multiple configurations to suit different needs and budgets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p><strong>The entry-level option comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics</strong>. This setup is more than capable of handling everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light creative work. It normally sells for $459, but the current discount drops the price to $329, marking a 28% savings.</p>

<p>Users who need extra power can step up to the higher-end model, which includes 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. This version runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 H 255 processor and is better suited for heavier multitasking, larger and more plentiful files, and more demanding applications. Its usual $759 price tag has been cut to $519, a 32% discount that brings premium specs into a far more approachable range. Storage expansion is also supported, with room to add an additional SSD for up to 4TB total capacity.</p>
<h2>Small Stature, Big Performance</h2>
<p>In daily use, performance feels snappy and responsive. The system handles office software, photo editing, and multitasking without slowing down, particularly in the 32GB configuration. Windows 11 Pro comes preinstalled, so setup is quick and straightforward right out of the box.</p>



<p>Display options are well supported. Using USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0, it can drive an 8K display at 60Hz. An HDMI port supports 4K at 60Hz. The three together means up to three monitors can be connected at once without any extra adapters.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 4.2 keep wireless connections fast and stable, while six USB 3.2 ports provide enough room for wired peripherals. Cooling is handled by dual centrifugal fans, a layered fin design, and a dedicated aluminum heatsink for the SSD, keeping noise and temperatures under control.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to reclaim desk space without giving up performance, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is worth a look—especially with current discounts pushing the top configuration down to just $519.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Landmark case could have huge repercussions for the wider industry.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A UK court has ruled that the unauthorized stealing of in-game currency can be legally classified as criminal theft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Jagex developer Andrew Lakeman was charged with allegedly stealing 705 billion Gold from almost 70 RuneScape players, with a real-world value of over half a million pounds, equivalent to around $750,000. He then sold this currency online for Bitcoin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Lakeman had no access to player accounts in his position at Jagex as a content developer, he allegedly accessed them by "hacking and/or using credentials of members of the account recovery team." In all, 68 players allegedly lost gold to Lakeman, starting around 2018.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here comes the science bit: the defendant's defence claimed that the in-game currency could not be classed as property under the definition of the UK's Theft Act, and initially, the court agreed, concluding that as RuneScape gold is not real — or "pure information" or "knowledge" as it's legally defined — it could not technically be stealable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judge at the time also deemed RuneScape's supply of Gold as being infinite, and it wasn't "rivalrous" given that having a piece of Gold doesn't deprive another player of getting Gold, too. The Court of Appeal, however, disagreed and last week handed down a <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>judgment</u></a> while explaining its reasoning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Judge Popplewell wrote. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite.' This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[RuneScape's gold is] properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language," the judgment added. "They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge:' functionally, they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The judgment concluded: "On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a judgment that could have profound implications for the games industry, as up until now, vendors that sell (or re-sell) in-game currency have existed in a grey market wherein <em>technically,</em> no theft has occurred if the digital asset stolen did not meet the definition of an intangible item under the definitions of theft in that country. The dubious line of when ownership of any such in-game currency transfers from the developer to the player — if at all — further compounds an already complex issue, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the issue of whether removing gold from player accounts constituted theft now settled, the case against Lakeman can proceed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Yayayaya.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dr Disrespect (@DrDisrespect) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDisrespect/status/2015156898040049967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That comment, which pointed to Highguard’s confirmed release date, came alongside an image of a supposed Highguard event badge, which some have speculated may have been generated by AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Highguard’s launch, questions were raised about the validity of Dr Disrespect’s post. Then, Wildlight Entertainment creator manager Chin Pua <a href="https://x.com/thingscp/status/2015884206329463060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter</a> to confirm Dr Disrespect had not attended the event, and that the badge was not official. "I can confirm DDR was not invited to any Highguard event past or present," Pua said, "and the badge was not an official badge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why did Dr Disrespect post the tweet and its image? In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jaHFgbgGqaw?si=tRaUr9hBxubnMqbL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stream playing Highguard yesterday</a>, he laughed the post off as a joke, and expressed disbelief at the social media controversy it had generated.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/27/gettyimages-1555295895-1769516265043.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dr Disrespect has said his Highguard tweet was a joke. Photo by Matt Thomas/San Diego Padres/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr Disrespect said on-stream: “‘Last week we took the Lambo to LA to check out #HighGuard.’ That's all we said. Did we say we went to the event? Did we say we got hands on? Did I say I was going to give you my review and feedback today? Huh? Did we say we were going to give our feedback and review today? ‘We got hands-on Highguard.’ Did I say that? Did we play the game? No. We just put together a photo poking fun. All these f***ing people took it seriously. Holy s**t. How brain dead is this f***ing industry? How stupid is this industry?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr Disrespect went on to hit out at his critics, defend his current brand, and insist he remains relevant. Dr Disrespect returned to YouTube in September 2024 three months after he was demonetized and suspended from the YouTube Partner Program following allegations regarding past conduct with a minor. Beahm has denied any wrongdoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highguard launched last night and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/highguard-launches-to-big-steam-concurrents-but-its-getting-absolutely-destroyed-in-user-reviews">met with big Steam concurrents but also a flood of negative user reviews</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its Q3 financial results for this fiscal year, and when it comes to consolidated results for the nine-month period as a whole, the studio is doing pretty well, as are some of its core franchises.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial presentation</a>, Capcom reveals that its sales, operating profit, and ordinary profit are all up by varying degrees when compared to March-December 2024, and the studio is on track for a better 2025-26 fiscal year as a whole, too.</p><p>When it comes to specific games, Capcom says the <em>Resident Evil </em>series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, "continued to grow" in sales terms, and that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>managed to surpass the 11 million sales mark within the March-December period as well.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has picked up another million sales for itself.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The new sales figure means <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another million sales since the end of March</a>, which rather validates Capcom's concern that sales slowed down dramatically after launch, although whether the so-called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"PS5 barrier" is to blame</a> is another matter.</p><p>Capcom also says that sales of the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake<em> </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>grew thanks to the announcement of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is due to arrive next month. Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total. It's fair to say Capcom is on the up right now.</p><figure role="group">
