            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s the difficulty of gathering your game group together consistently, you prefer playing solo, or you're just looking for new players to test your strategies against, physical board games and tabletop experiences may not be enough. Luckily, some fantastic games have been adapted into digital formats that allow for gaming wherever your gaming group may be and for tense matches whenever you want. It really is an exciting time to be a fan of tabletop games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This guide will point you in the direction of digital adaptations that will scratch that itch you have to play some board games, but also serve as learning resources to introduce new titles into your game night rotation.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Just a note: This list won’t include digital adaptations for TCGs such as Magic: The Gathering or Virtual Tabletop platforms for TTRPGs; it focuses solely on board games. </em></p><p id="root"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Root">Root</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225994"><div id="225994" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Root</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Root from Leder Games disguises rich asymmetric area control under the facade of cute and cuddly woodland critters. Anywhere from one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> struggle against one another, attempting to take control of areas and complete unique faction-specific goals to earn Victory Points. Whoever reaches 30 points first wins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital adaptation successfully captures the visual style of Kyle Ferrin’s art and benefits from different aspects being automated. Root offers both Local and Online play in addition to some wonderful tutorials, which are especially helpful and a great resource in learning all of the factions. Speaking of factions, developer Direwolf Digital (expect to see that more on the list) continues to release expansions, unlocking new maps and playable factions.</p></div><p id="dune-imperium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dune: Imperium">Dune: Imperium</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225995"><div id="225995" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dune: Imperium</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With the physical version winning <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/news/2022/2022-sxsw-gaming-awards-winners-announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXSW’s Board Game of the Year in 2022</a> and the digital adaptation recently winning <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3508413/19th-annual-golden-geek-winners-for-2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BoardGameGeeks' 2024 Golden Geek</a> award for Best Board Game App, Dune: Imperium is an easy recommendation. This mixture of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-worker-placement-board-games">worker placement</a> and deck-building title set in the Dune universe is a modern classic that offers a fun time for board game hobbyists while not being overly complicated to get into for newcomers. Players take turns placing their spies around Dune, improving their standing with different groups, and waging war in an effort to earn enough points to trigger the end game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's really neat about this digital version is that not only does it feature a good tutorial, solo play against computers, and online play (ranked, events, and casual options), but you can also test your skills with special Challenge games with unique rules. Regardless of how you play it, anyone even remotely interested in board games should try Dune: Imperium – or its sort of 2nd Edition, Dune: Imperium - Uprising – at least once. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-imperium-board-game-review">Dune: Imperium board game review </a>for more details about the game itself.</p></div><p id="spirit-island"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Spirit Island">Spirit Island</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225996"><div id="225996" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Spirit Island</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You are a powerful spirit, and your island and its inhabitants, the Dahan (who are also your worshippers), are in danger from foreign invaders who are laying claim to portions of your home. It’s up to you and your fellow spirits to deal with this problem. Spirit Island is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> deck-building and area control game, where you and your friends will have to use your spirits’ special abilities and build out a power deck to force these colonists off your island. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital implementation streamlines the process, offloading all of the upkeep between turns like spawning more colonists and moving them around, making this feel like an overall much faster game. Despite being a cooperative title, this game can be challenging, but luckily, the various spirits are ranked in terms of complexity, so even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a> can have a good time. Adding in the expansions will provide you with even more spirits to choose from, more customization choices for your island, with Horizons of Spirit Island designed as the ideal jumping-in point for those learning Spirit Island. </p></div><p id="machi-koro-with-everyone"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Machi Koro with Everyone">Machi Koro with Everyone</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225997"><div id="225997" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Machi Koro with Everyone</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s even better than getting one digital board game? Getting two! Machi Koro with Everyone is a digital bundle that provides players with both the first and second versions of this delightful and charming game. In Machi Koro, players spend coins to buy new properties for their small cities and roll dice to try to earn money, with the end goal of being the first person to build three special buildings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This adaptation features colorful art and cute customizable avatars. It is an excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">board game for families</a> to enjoy, thanks to its local play functionality and short game time of approximately 20 minutes. When you’re ready, though, you can go online and test your skills against other players around the world. Machi Koro with Everyone is the easiest game to learn on this list, and arguably one of the most charming.</p></div><p id="scythe-digital-edition"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Scythe: Digital Edition">Scythe: Digital Edition</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225998"><div id="225998" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Scythe: Digital Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in an alternate version of the 1920s Europe where giant mechs exist and help with farming (and war), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scythe-board-game-buying-guide">Scythe</a> is an engine-building / worker placement game where players manage not only gathering resources but also waging war on one another. This digital adaptation of the game captures all of the tense moments and rich strategy that players have fallen in love with in the physical board game, but speeds things up thanks to the automation of various systems that only a digital game can provide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a nifty added bonus, Sythe Digital allows you to customize the paint scheme of your units. If you're looking to play against your friends instead of just the computer or random folks online, Scythe: Digital Edition features crossplay, allowing you to play with others regardless of the platform.</p></div><p id="gloomhaven"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="225999"><div id="225999" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Gloomhaven</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It could be argued that one of the games that has defined this new era of tabletop was 2017’s behemoth of a game, Gloomhaven. This sprawling campaign title featuring 95 unique scenarios, branching storylines, a ton of characters, and intricate card-based combat has left it’s mark on the scene, but one thing that has always held it back somewhat are the space it takes up and the large amount of time investment it takes to get to the end. Thankfully, Gloomhaven has a digital version that allows you to play online with your friends, instead of trying to organize 50 in-person game nights with friends, regardless of what platform someone may own the game on. If you find yourself a master Gloomhaven player already, then you can take on the 100 special Guildmaster missions or build your own levels with the game’s built-in level editor, and share with the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our love for Gloomhaven here at IGN is well established, being featured on a number of our various board game buyer’s guides including “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-rpg-board-games">The Best RPG Board Games Worth Playing</a>”, “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">The Best Campaign Board Games</a>”,  “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/board-games-like-dungeons-and-dragons">11 Board Games Like Dungeons &amp; Dragons Worth Playing</a>”, and now you can add one more to the list. The game really is just that good, and this is the easiest way to play, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review">Jaws of the Lion expansion</a>. And there is no better way to get ready for the upcoming digital version of its follow-up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frosthaven-board-game-review">Frosthaven</a>!</p></div><p id="dominion"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dominion">Dominion</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226000"><div id="226000" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dominion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The progenitor of the deck-building genre of board games, Dominion is the perfect game to bust out when you have a little time to kill. In Dominion, players take turns buying cards from a shared pool of available options, determined by the expansions and sets they have, creating unique scenarios. What makes this game beloved is how different card effects and triggers play off of one another, requiring you to plan out not only what cards you will purchase, but also the order in which to play them from your hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This digital version continues to see strong support, with many of the physical game’s expansions seeing release in this format as well, and with the option to play not only against computer opponents of various difficulties, you can also play online against friends and random players around the world, regardless of the platform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the base game, which can provide hours of fun on its own, is completely free, when paired with just how many expansions you can also get for this digital game, make it an easy inclusion on the list, and we have also featured Dominion on some of our other lists too, including the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games"><u>best deck-building games</u></a>.</p></div><p id="werewolf-mafia"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Werewolf / Mafia">Werewolf / Mafia</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226001"><div id="226001" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>One Night: Ultimate Werewolf</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">How well can you tell when your friends are lying, and how well can you hide when you are? Werewolf / Mafia is the purest form of social deduction and deception out there, and while it balances the lines of whether it's a social experience or a game, there are still a ton of options available to folks who want to play this online with their friends. Many of these can be played right from the internet browser on your smart device or computer (<a href="https://wolfy.net/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://wolfy.net/</u></a> , <a href="https://mafiathegame.benrobinson.dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mafia The Game</u></a>, <a href="https://mafia.gg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://mafia.gg/</u></a>, and <a href="https://netgames.io/games/onu-werewolf/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>One Night Ultimate Werewolf</u></a> are some free examples), others like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/334230/Town_of_Salem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Town of Salem</u></a> and its sequel, which have higher production values and more “stuff” to them, can be found on Steam or the various app stores.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Werewolf is a blast to play at parties, and thanks to these online options, you can play with your friends whenever you want! There is also a really interesting history behind the game that you can check out on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=049fTXv6XFI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>No Pun Included</u></a> YouTube channel.</p></div><p id="wingspan"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Wingspan">Wingspan</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226002"><div id="226002" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Wingspan</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Birds. Birds everywhere! Wingspan is one of those games that has seemingly been able to break into the mainstream consumer environment (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><u>we think it's pretty great</u></a>, too). If your family or game group is one of those who adores collecting these feathered friends, this digital version of Wingspan is a must-have. Wingspan is an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine-building game</a> in which you attract different types of birds to roost on your board, lay eggs, and earn points. Thanks to this release, you will be able to play all the Wingspan you can handle, including against your friends, regardless of where they buy it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t have a bunch of time all at once to sit down and play a complete game of Wingspan, this digital version also lets you play over the course of numerous days in the form of its asynchronous play. This also allows you to have multiple games going on all at once!</p></div><p id="board-game-arena"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Board Game Arena">Board Game Arena</h2></p><div catalogid="325000aa-8eb1-4a03-84ec-ee87235c486d" id="226003"><div id="226003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Board Game Arena</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 1,000 games, more than half of which are available to play even with a free account, Board Game Arena is an amazing option when you and your far-off friends want to enjoy a night of game playing. Playable straight from your phone, tablet, or computer’s browser, BGA lets players connect with other players around the world, take part in tournaments, play either in real time or asynchronously over the span of a week or longer, and even create a friends list so it’s easy to connect with loved ones. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Classic and beloved titles like Catan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ticket-to-ride-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions">Ticket To Ride</a>, River of Gold, and Wingspan are all available, in addition to some brand-new games that aren’t even out yet. A vast majority of the games on BGA (917 currently) come with in-depth step-by-step tutorials to help you learn the game, too. This is a handy tool for individuals who want to make sure they like a game before spending a bunch of money on the physical product. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want access to the entire catalog that Board Game Arena offers, you will have to pay to get a Premium account, but at only $5 a month or $36 a year, the price is well worth it just for the additional games you get alone. However, free players can still play those games, they just can’t make a table of those games, meaning they are still able to join other premium players’ tables without having to drop a dime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of all the games on this list, Board Game Arena is by far the best value for your buck. The service runs on your normal internet browser, so anyone with a smartphone can join and play, though we recommend playing it on your computer or tablet instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the very opposite of the idea behind this list, check out our picks for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">best board games based on video games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em> Scott White is a freelance contributor to IGN, assisting with tabletop games and guide coverage.

                <p>Xbox has expanded its game streaming perk for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Starting today, July 28, players can now stream their Xbox library to their PCs directly through the Xbox PC app.</p><p>In recent years, Microsoft has added the ability to stream your Xbox library to many devices, including Xbox consoles, smart TVs, and browsers. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-july-update-more-ways-to-play/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> today that this functionality has finally been added to the Xbox app on PC, meaning that most Xbox-related functionality should now be available in the app.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563"></a><figcaption>Your Xbox library has gotten a fresh coat of paint across devices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg"></figure><p>Streaming Xbox games isn't just a neat way to access your Game Pass library when you're away from your console or home PC. It also lets PC-only players access Xbox console exclusives that haven't made their way to PC yet.</p><p>Microsoft has also rolled out a bunch of other upgrades for the Xbox PC app. These are highlighted by efforts to consolidate and streamline the cloud gaming process. The app surfaces cross-device play history, meaning that you can start playing a game on Xbox and pick up your progress via game streaming in the app. The app update also adds a more cohesive game library, combining all games available to stream across consoles, including both purchased games and those available via Game Pass. Both of these changes are currently available for members of the Xbox Insider program, which is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free to join and open for everyone.</a></p><p>Finally, the Xbox PC app now has an easier way to track Microsoft Rewards. Microsoft states that the new system will surface Rewards progress as you play, allowing you to track points across play sessions.</p>

That’s where the Banandium Root resides. Believing it has the power to grant wishes, Donkey Kong and Pauline set out to claim it for themselves. The journey takes you through 16 different layers of the world before you finally get there, collecting Banandium Gems, unlocking new skills, and defeating members of the evil mining company VoidCo along the way. It’s long, especially if you take your time to hunt down hidden bananas and other secrets on every level. </p><p>I wasn’t expecting its story to pay off with any particularly big surprises, but  right before you reach the Planet Core, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> reveals the true final boss that’s been waiting in the wings: King K. Rool. The Kremlin leader hasn’t been in a Donkey Kong game since the 2007 spin-off <em>Donkey Kong: Jungle Climber</em>. He’s not in any of the marketing for <em>Bananza</em> and fans have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1ltjofn/k_rool_discussions_from_15_years_ago_following/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1ltjofn/k_rool_discussions_from_15_years_ago_following/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debating for months</a></span> whether Nintendo would actually bring him back after all this time.</p><figure id="" data-id="65053e9ec1c1a938c01dd5af22b66c61" data-recommend-id="image://65053e9ec1c1a938c01dd5af22b66c61" data-format="png" data-width="1476" data-height="803" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="King K.

In a big arena surrounded by golden Banandium, he whips out his iconic Blunderbuss to fire off Kannonballs just like old times.  Being surrounded by all that Banandium lets DK stay transformed the whole time to make use of all of his powers, and the elephant form proves to be particularly useful, letting DK snort up all the rot and fire it back at K. Rool. When the Kremling King tries to suck DK up in his Blunderbuss, you can launch boulders at it to make it explode on him. It’s an excellent showdown that riffs on the final boss fight in <em>Donkey Kong Country 2 </em>while using all of <em>Bananza</em>’s modern, <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>-inspired tricks.</p><figure id="" data-id="86ff1253b5762f182d9cfcaa9212e08a" data-recommend-id="image://86ff1253b5762f182d9cfcaa9212e08a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="DK flies over lava.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It would be cool enough if everything stopped there, but in keeping with its tribute to <em>Donkey Kong</em>’s past, <em>Bananza</em> pulls a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ppmP7eG2Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ppmP7eG2Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>DKC1</em>-style credits fake-out</a></span> to lead into phase two of the fight. Except that instead of a harder redux of what just transpired, <em>Bananza</em> goes full <em>Uncharted</em> and turns the final stretch of the game into one long set piece. First DK and Pauline have to ride a massive pillar of bananas to the surface, fighting a flying K. Rool along the way. Fending him off, they finally break through the planet’s surface only to find themselves in New Donk City from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, where we first met grown-up Pauline back during the launch year of the original Switch. </p><p>New Donk City would have been a wild reveal for an after-credits stinger. Instead it’s just the prelude to one final platforming section as Banandium rot fills up the entire city and DK races to K. Rool’s fortress in the sky. It’s a bit like the final level in<em> Super Mario 3D World</em> where Bowser becomes a cat and has you chase him up the side of his tower. How many residents of New Donk City were harmed as the streets flooded with molten banana mush? Too many. But the action finally culminates in a second boss fight that’s even more spectacular than the first. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> runs decently most of the time on Switch 2, but there are moments when K. Rool coats the entire arena in Banandium rot that sent my framerate crashing into the single digits in handheld mode.</p><figure id="" data-id="d115899b9c1562400bcea903f989b1d9" data-recommend-id="image://d115899b9c1562400bcea903f989b1d9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="DK punches a big cannon ball.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s only one snag in this roller coaster ride, and that’s the checkpointing. Instead of letting you load directly into fights, you have to do the brief platforming sections right before them again each time you die. Turn off the game and you’ll have to start the New Donk City portion all over again. With the right power-ups the fight isn’t nearly as hard as the <em>DKC2</em> one that inspires it, but if you’re out of items or didn’t upgrade your elephant transformation enough, you might be in for a rough time. I’ll also say that while the music is properly cinematic and sweeping, it’s nowhere near as iconic as the original boss fight melodies from <em>DKC1</em> and <em>DKC2</em>.</p><p>All that said, the ending of <em>Bananza</em> might still be my favorite ending to a Nintendo game since at least the start of the original Switch era. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> also had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-perfect-mario-odyssey-moment-1820478948&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-perfect-mario-odyssey-moment-1820478948">a big surprise waiting for players</a></span> after its final fight, too. Like a lot of other pieces of that game, it feels like <em>Bananza</em>’s ending takes some of those ideas an expands them, while playing to the strengths and leaning into the fan service elements unique to <em>Donkey Kong</em>. Unlike <em>Mario</em>, who gets big new games every console generation, DK’s been on the bench for over a decade, and King K. Rool even longer. The end of <em>Bananza</em> offers fans of both a well-deserved payout. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-ending-final-boss-odyssey-1851787178]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>When Tencent revealed Light of Motiram. everyone, and we mean <em>everyone,</em> said just one thing –&nbsp; “That looks a LOT like Sony’s Horizon franchise”. From the design of the characters to the metal beasts, some of which are almost identical to those which Aloy battles, the game was clearly a copy.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bABDo5r5fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tencent were never going to get away with it and Sony have now filed a lawsuit against them, but there’s an added detail we did not know before. It turns of Tencent had been pitching a Horizon game to Sony in 2024 but it had been rejected. It seems they just went ahead and made a copy instead.</p>
<p>Sony’s lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California last week, on July 25, 2025, and in it it states that Light of Motirm is a “slavish clone” of its games that copies multiple elements that would confuse consumers. They also reference many video games websites that noted the similarities. They have asked the court to award unspecified damages and block the release of Light of Motiram.<br>
</p>
<p>“Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first,” we noted <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/01/tencents-light-of-motiram-looks-very-very-familiar/">when the game was announced.</a> Should have put money on that.</p>

<p>NCSoft’s Horizon MMO was been cancelled before it was announced, another casualty from Sony’s ill-fated live service push. However, a Horizon movie was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/helldivers-and-horizon-zero-dawn-movies-announced-by-sony/">announced at the start of the year.</a></p>
<p>By all counts, Horizon Forbidden West sold well, it just maybe didn’t meaningfully outpace the original. Having launched in February 2022, Horizon Forbidden West had sold over 8.4 million units by April 2023 (13-14 months after launch), not too far removed from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/28/horizon-zero-dawn-sells-7-6-million-copies-to-be-sonys-biggest-new-franchise/">7.6 million that Horizon Zero Dawn sold by its first anniversary</a>.</p>
<p>The series has seen plenty of activity since then with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/19/horizon-forbidden-west-burning-shores-review/">Burning Shores</a>&nbsp;story expansion later in 2023, the PC port launching in 2024, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn remaster</a>&nbsp;late last year as well. In an unexpected move, Sony also produced a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/lego-horizon-adventures-review/">Lego Horizon Adventures spin-off</a>&nbsp;that launched across PS5, PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony Interactive Entertainment is suing Tencent over the latter’s unreleased <em>Light of Motiram </em>game, which Sony says is a copy of its own Horizon series — something <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lots of other folks</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tencent-plans-to-release-light-of-motiram-which-some-say-is-a-rip-off-of-sonys-horizon-games-on-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been saying</a> too, since the game was announced last year. In November, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/11/light-of-motiram-adds-ps5-ios-and-android-versions-reveal-trailer-and-16-minutes-of-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tencent even claimed the game</a> would be released on Sony’s PlayStation 5 console.</p><p>In the lawsuit, which was filed Friday in the Northern District of California court <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and first reported by Reuters</a>, Sony says it’s filing the lawsuit to “prevent the imminent release of <em>Light of Motiram</em>,” a game it called a “slavish clone” of Sony’s Horizon games. Sony says that nearly all parts of the game are copied from either <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>. As the lawsuit tells it, Tencent began work on <em>Light of Motiram</em> in 2023 before approaching Sony with a pitch in 2024 that Tencent should develop a Horizon game. “Sony rejected the idea and considered the matter closed,” lawyers wrote in the complaint, <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/894196514/Sony-vs-Tencent-via-Aftermath" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which you can read in full here</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>“Apparently, Tencent was undeterred by SIE’s refusal to license its Horizon intellectual property,” lawyers wrote. “Tencent continued secretly developing <em>Light of Motiram</em>, evening announcing a forthcoming game.”</p><p>The details of Horizon’s world seem everywhere in the marketing material that’s been made public so far — the character bears a strong resemblance to Aloy, from the character’s design and clothing; the world is near identical, blending lush forest environments with mechanical creatures and technology; and even the game’s title text uses similar detailing. Sony’s lawyers spend several pages of the 48-page complaint outlining the ways in which <em>Light of Motiram</em> is a copy of Horizon, including pulling headlines from news outlets and comments from forums and social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony claims it approached Tencent again this year to “informally resolve its concern that <em>Light of Motiram</em> violated its intellectual property rights,” per the complaint. That’s when Tencent <em>again</em> tried to license the Horizon IP, and Sony apparently rejected the ask a second time. That’s why Sony filed the lawsuit, it says in the complaint. To put it bluntly, Sony also says — later in the lawsuit — that <em>Light of Motiram</em> “is the result of the development project that Tencent previously pitched.”</p><p>The suit includes parts of the pitch deck Tencent approached Sony with. In that meeting, lawyers wrote that Tencent’s Aurora Studios development team said its members were “die-hard fans” of the franchise and included screenshots to prove it — the pitch deck has a slide that shows all the trophies the team has earned playing Horizon.</p><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>The pitch deck posited a version of a “games-as-a-service” expansion of the Horizon series that brings in Eastern aesthetics – the pitch deck included a slide with an image of Aloy on the Great Wall of China – and survival game elements like crafting and pets. Tencent didn’t share that they already had <em>Light of Motiram</em> in development, Sony’s lawyers say. Shortly after, in 2024, Tencent put up its Steam page for <em>Light of Motiram</em> and described it like this:</p><blockquote><p>“In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting&nbsp; from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><figure><figcaption><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sony says in the suit that if you swap out the words “Motiram” in the description of the game on its Steam page and put in “Old Ones,” (the lost civilization in Horizon) that the description may as well have been one for Horizon. There’s a lot of images in the complaint to back up the claims of <em>Light of Motiram</em> being a copy — again, of the technology being overtaken by overgrowth, hulking machines that resemble animals, and even the red grass that Aloy blends in with to hide, because of her red hair. (The grass in <em>Light of Motiram</em> doesn’t need to be red, Sony says, because the character in one screenshot shown in the lawsuit doesn’t have red hair. But the game's character does indeed have red hair.)</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p><em><em>Via Sony Interactive Entertainment's </em>complaint</em></p><p>Another piece that Sony pulls out as an example is the Horizon games’ “focus” device, a mysterious piece of tech that Aloy wears in her ear. It’s used to scan the environment for different points of interest, but a big piece of the story, too. The piece of tech is called Angelos in <em>Light of Motiram</em>.</p><p>Sony says in the complaint that Tencent will release a “beta version” of the game for American players “imminently,” before the full release “soon thereafter.” The lawsuit doesn’t mention the potential for a PlayStation 5 release, and the game doesn’t have a PlayStation 5 game page. Neither Sony nor Tencent have responded to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><p>Sony is asking the court for injunctions that would prevent the release of <em>Light of Motiram</em> and for damages of up to $150,000 per infringement, among other penalties.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/runequest-warlords-preview-fantasy-strategy-at-its-finest.1255434/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re not already familiar with the IP we’re dealing with today, then you’re not alone. Even as a fan of Tabletop RPGs, I hadn’t come across <em>RuneQuest </em>much outside of passive mentions that basically sold it as a more “hardcore” version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DnD </a>with deeper lore. Either way, our <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> Preview is about this new turn-based strategy title set in the TTRPG’s universe, and whether it’ll stand tall enough to sell some newcomers on this complex and intricate setting.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> – A Turn-Based Fantasy Throw-Down</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=2FjFmZ2a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-various-fantasy-units-hanging-out-in-some-woods.jpg?itok=HTuF7rnm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These humble beginnings bely a surprisingly deep sense of worldbuilding.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve played many strategy titles before, then you’ll probably be pretty familiar with the bread-and-butter of the gameplay in <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>. It’s a <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/strategy-rpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">turn-based strategy RPG</a>/Skirmisher where you control several different units on a grid-based map. Each turn, the various combatants have a certain number of action points to use up, and once you run out, your turn is over, and the other side gets to run around attacking you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s also the standard array of special abilities, different stats for the different unit types, and a decent amount of progression brought into the mix from <em>RuneQuest</em>’s TTRPG roots. As you go, both your heroes and your standard army units get stronger, and you’ll have to manage these upgrades and your army in general between each mission of the campaign. Like I said, it’s all relatively standard for a turn-based strategy title, but that’s not to say that the game has nothing interesting or unique to offer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Welcome to (Fantasy) Flavortown</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=I_Su0jnN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-top-down-view-of-a-grid-based-map.jpg?itok=5GLfQoX7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This tactical view gives you a pretty comprehensive overview of the entire field.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><div><p>A lot of the appeal of <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em> comes from the lore and storyline. Going into it without any background knowledge, it would be easy to only see a standard ‘European Fantasy’ setting and just shut off your mind during all of the dialogue, but that would be a huge mistake. While there are certainly enough familiar fantasy elements to keep genre fans happy, if you pay attention to the world and the characters, you start to get hints of a pretty deep and involved lore bubbling just under the surface.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
There’s clearly a decent focus on religious conflict here, but the tone remains relatively grounded. It is pretty much devoid of any sense of ‘tongue-in-cheek’ or self-parody, meaning things feel genuinely earnest in the way they’re brought across. While this might be an issue if you struggle to take fantasy settings too seriously, if you let yourself go, it can really suck you in. Hell, I only get to play 4 missions and I’m already interested in learning more about everything that’s going on in the larger world setting of the RPG.&nbsp;</p></div>

<h2>Tabletop Pedigree</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=v1FR9-0O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-whole-cluster-of-units-fighting-each-other-in-a-narrow-pass.jpg?itok=9X0NL2Qw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sure, my strategy basically boils down to "put all my dudes in a cluster and hope they overwhelm the enemy", but so far, it's working.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>There are other gameplay elements in <em>RuneQuest: Warlord</em> that make it feel even more strongly tied to the tabletop than other physical-to-digital adaptations like this. At the start of each battle, you have to deploy the forces that you’ve managed to keep your hands on in the campaign thus far. All of these units and heroes have a points value, and the mission will have a strict limit on how many points your army is allowed to take up. If you’ve ever played a tabletop miniatures game, then you’ll know this is a pretty common facet of those games, and it leads to some interesting dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The points limit means you have to be more creative than just dumping all of your points and effort into the same group of characters and units. Sure, they’re going to be killer units, but they’ll cost so much that you won’t be able to cover enough ground on certain missions. It forces you to keep a bit of variety amongst all of your characters, as well as giving you the opportunity to try different approaches on all of the missions, especially if things don’t work in your favor on your first run.</p>

<h2>A High Quality of Life</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=zbclYQ7Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-single-unit-left-on-the-field-with-a-large-blood-patch-nearby.jpg?itok=qJ2UDMRq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if the large patch of gore and viscera could be a clue as to what has just occured here.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that stands out in&nbsp;<em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>&nbsp;is the quality-of-life additions to the game. Firstly, you can go around handing out commands to all of your units at once instead of having to wait for all of the animations to finish, which is great if you’re itching to see what’s about to happen or you’re going for a speed run. You’ve also got a hotkey that moves onto your next unit, which is pretty standard, but it only works if that unit has any action or movement points left to use up, which is a nice touch that saves you wondering who the hell had AP left when that “are you sure” pop-up hits when you try to end your turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that is a layer of polish that sells this as one of the best-assembled fantasy strategy titles in recent memory. Everything from the way the UI notifies you of buffs and debuffs to the intuitive setup of the menus and buttons you need during your turn. You’ve also got a full tactical map from a top-down perspective that gives you an insane tactical advantage over your opponents. Even for hardcore fans of the genre, there’s a lot of promise on display here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My Final Thought</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=5EalYqlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runequest-warlords-screenshot-showing-a-thick-bundle-of-player-units-in-a-choke-point-between-two-mountains.jpg?itok=bVnI7WqQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here I stand again, forcing myself into a choke-point because I refuse to learn any lessons.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>I have managed to hook myself on <em>RuneQuest: Warlords</em>, and I’ve only seen 4 missions so far. This is a fantastic package to experience this world setting, and even if you’re already into turn-based strategy games with a fantasy setting, then you’ll still find that so much of this game has been done right that there’s plenty to get your teeth into. The real test will be if this momentum can be maintained for the rest of the game, and I for one can’t wait to find out.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is suing Tencent, alleging its upcoming game Light of Motiram is "a slavish clone of SIE's...Horizon series of video games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaint, which was filed in a California court last week, alleges that Tencent's upcoming adventure game Light of Motiram is illegally similar to Horizon: Forbidden West and Horizon: Zero Dawn in everything from creature design to protagonist to marketing materials. The complaint outlines numerous similarities, comparing various marketing screenshots from both games as well as the game descriptions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Horizon, Light of Motiram takes place in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by giant robot dinosaurs who roam large, natural environments such as tropical forests, deserts, and snowy mountains. Humans, just like in Horizon, live in tribal groups and must fight the machine animals, who also largely line up with those in Horizon, to survive. Both games even feature red-haired women protagonists that wear very similar outfits and styles, and Motiram even has its lead sporting a device awfully similar to Aloy's "Focus" earpiece.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/28/capture-1753727930304.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A comparison between the two games' marketing imagery, as shared in Sony's complaint.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The complaint also cites headlines from a number of gaming websites, including Kotaku, TheGamer, and GameRant, as well as various Steam and Reddit comments, that all remark on the similarities between the two games and the likelihood that Sony would probably sue over the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The commonalities with Horizon disclosed in the Light of Motiram promotional game trailer and other promotional materials included not only identical story and gameplay themes, cultural, and character elements, but also art style, landscapes, architectural and art elements, color palettes, fonts, and symbols. Lighting and points of view are also highly similar," the complaint reads.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also per Sony's complaint, Tencent allegedly knew exactly what it was doing here. Sony says that Tencent began developing Light of Motiram in 2023, and approached Sony at the 2024 Game Developers Conference to ask for a licensing deal to develop its own Horizon game. Sony turned Tencent down. But Tencent kept developing Light of Motiram anyway. Sony also claims it approached Tencent informally to resolve the copyright dispute once it became aware of the game, but when it did so, Sony says Tencent tried once again to license Horizon. Sony once again refused, and Tencent allegedly moved forward with the game's promotions and playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony is suing Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement, as well as false designation of origin. It's asking the court to forbid Tencent from infringing its copyright, for costs and damages of up to $150,000 for each separate work in Horizon that's been infringed, and demand that Tencent deliver all infringing materials to Sony for destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Light of Motiram has a Steam listing, but no release date just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>F1 star Lewis Hamilton is just like many gamers in that he's very excited for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. Speaking to fans recently, Hamilton listed off some of his favorite games, going on to single out GTA 6 as a game that he's so amped for that he's planning to "cancel all my work" when it releases.</p><p>"I'm a big gamer. I play a lot of Call of Duty, for sure... but I like Assassin’s Creed, Gran Turismo," he said. "I'm dying for the new Grand Theft Auto to come out. GTA 6! Yeah, that's the one I'm waiting for.

And I supported of course that approach," Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said. "While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection."</p><p>GTA 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.

			<p>During a recent press event, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went hands-on with Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, the upcoming survival horror game based on a brand new IP created by Polish developer Bloober Team. Following the demo session, we interviewed Bloober's Lead Level Designer, Piotr Tylus, to learn more about this intriguing game, which is currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-set-to-launch-in-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to launch sometime in the Fall season</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>The setting here is very much close to home for you and the development team. First and foremost, what made you guys pick this specific city to focus on for Kronos?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it's part of history for at least part of the Bloober team, which has made games in Poland before. It's a formula that works better every time. In here, it's on a grander scale. For one of our developers, it's really, like, personal. He lives some ten minutes from the location that inspired the game. It's just pretty cool to put a part of you and a part of history in there, and also, it gives you this advantage that it's pretty exotic in terms of setting. Not that many people have exposure to this brutalist socialist stuff. So for us, it's just important and also exciting and hopefully gonna be exciting for other people.</p>



<p>I don't have a connection to Nowa Huta or Krakow. I don't live there, but it was a great opportunity to do my craft, do the research, being there, I can be on a trip, like moving through the streets, and it's always a fun part of the job just being on the location. For me, it was the first time to actually recreate something real, so yeah, it was a fun process. You want to take the atmosphere in, but you also have to gamify to some degree, right? You can't take it 1-to-1 and call it a day.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, I think the last thing players want is to have to actually walk through entire city blocks while they're being chased by some of these anomalies.</strong> <strong>Anyway, it feels like there's a combination of very intimate encounters within hallways and expansive, open arenas. How do you balance the two to keep the narrative interesting while still flowing for Cronos?</strong></p>



<p>It's always a balancing act. We start the process by basically setting up the base of what we want to achieve at the moment and then picking the proper place to build around it. Those locations are not random. We try to understand what's the best fit for the encounter we want to make and the game's mechanics to keep things fresh. Also, the merging mechanic comes in handy because it's a really flexible framework to work with. You can do a lot of cool stuff. You probably saw some of the setups, and it grows more and more into the game. Hopefully that answers your question.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah. When you're building out these levels, do you have a specific objective in mind where you want the player to kind of backtrack more than in earlier sections?</strong></p>



<p>For sure, it's really important to give this idea. Backtracking is a thing in our game. There's optional routes in our game. Also, exploration is a huge part of Cronos and it also plays to the difficulty. If you won't explore, you're probably gonna have a hard time, but that's a challenge that you're imposing on yourself. We want to make players curious but also give them a reason behind all this exploration. It's part story, part actual thing that will help them push through all the challenges they face.</p>



<p><strong>I came across a couple of collectibles during my playthrough, such as comic books. We also discovered one cat by going off the beaten path. What other side objectives or collectibles have you tucked away in the game's levels?</strong></p>



<p>I believe that in the demo, we have a pretty representative part of what you can expect later. Of course, there's also just small side stories related to places, actually. There's a couple of narrative bits that maybe you don't need to collect them to understand the story, but if you want to feel what those people feel, it's probably wise to do that, but yeah, mostly, it's those collectibles that you mentioned and also just valuables, like energy, how we call it in our game, to make yourself stronger.</p>



<p><strong>How much will players be able to backtrack and return to much earlier areas in Cronos: The New Dawn?</strong></p>



<p>I need to bite my tongue. I cannot really share anything, but I will only say that it opens up. I'll put it that way.</p>



<p><strong>One of the things that you hinted at before we got into the demo was that there would be different survivors to recruit, and we could choose whether we wanted to save them or not. Will these decisions impact either the levels that you go into or how you can proceed?</strong></p>



<p>To some degree, those decisions matter in terms of both, what you have around, what you experience. Also, there's the gameplay element to that. There are those perks that we mentioned in the presentation. You couldn't see that in the demo. Also, let's say those souls go through the journey with you, let's put it that way. Who you're gonna choose, who you're gonna save, affects the experience overall.</p>



<p><strong>How permanent are those choices in Cronos?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good one. Let's put it that way: there's no coming back after you make a choice. Of course, if you want to replay the game with different choices, you are free to do so.</p>



<p><strong>Are you considering including a New Game Plus mode for Cronos: The New Dawn?</strong></p>



<p>There is a New Game Plus, and there's difficulty modifiers as well.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Cronos_Nest-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Resource management is very much a central pillar to survival horror, and here you had to make a lot of interesting choices as you're gathering these resources, gathering whether it's energy or the chemicals and the metal scraps to choose whether you want to create ammunition or health. How do you kind of balance it by having the scarcity but also ensuring that players never run out of options?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah, there are some mechanics in the game that support that. Enemies are dropping stuff so that there is a way for you to survive even if you're in a pinch, but it requires a little bit more work for the player. Other than that, it's just playtesting and what we feel like the experience we want to give you is, because you probably noticed that there are some areas or some, let's say, challenges, which are designed in a certain way that you need to survive to pull through. We wanted to have those difficulty spikes to keep it fresh.</p>



<p><strong>The boss fight that bookended our demo session was pretty much a battle of attrition where we wound up using just about every resource we had on hand, whether it was the healing sprays, the shotgun ammo, or the handgun ammo. If players find themselves backed into a wall during one of these boss fights where they run out of ammo, do you generate new ammo throughout the encounters that players can still pick up to finish the fight?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned, if there are other enemies, there is a way to replenish resources, especially if you're low, but with those encounters, there's a fixed way. You can always come back and explore more because you probably missed something if you feel like you're not well-equipped. But as you mentioned, we want the player to use all the tools available. That's important for us. That's why there are some challenges you need to overcome to learn that this works that way, and you need to keep using it in order to go through.</p>



<p><strong>One of the fascinating mechanics we haven't seen before in survival games is the merge system for Cronos: The New Dawn. When introducing new enemy types, do you onboard the player by introducing them on their own, or do you give them a trial by fire by throwing this new enemy type into something that can merge with them right away?</strong></p>



<p>Well, it differs in terms of what enemy we're talking about. Sometimes it's like that, other times it's more in an intimate scenario.</p>



<p><strong>A lot of times, these encounters feel fair. You might not be able to see something on screen, but you can definitely hear it coming up behind you. On the other hand, in the apartments, it was very claustrophobic and there you introduce exploding enemies that players had never seen before, so they will go around the corner and randomly just explode in a shower of acid on them. What's your mindset for shocking the players with moments like this?</strong></p>



<p>Well, with those little ones... We don't really want players to feel like they are invincible. Sometimes you need to slow down. The world is dangerous, right? So, it's wise to look around, so yeah, there are some enemies like that, like traps. That's the reason behind it. Of course, as you can imagine, they reappear in a different context later on.</p>



<p><strong>You guys introduced the torch fuel more as a defensive mechanic to drop down since it burns enemies around you and allows you to escape. But at the same time, you use it to essentially solve environmental puzzles, burn away blockades in your path, et cetera. What was behind the conscious decision to make that a core traversal mechanic?</strong></p>



<p>In those moments, you need to pick your path. Sometimes, the main path is closed, and it's just a learning experience, more or less, but there are a lot of optional paths that you can take. You might be in trouble there, but you can always come back later if you're more confident with that.</p>



<p>The reason behind it is to put a little bit more decision-making because our combat is all about you being prepared. You decide what you want to do and how to approach.</p>



<p><strong>Cronos: The New Dawn is a project that's been in development at Bloober Team for at least four years. During this time, you released the Silent Hill 2 remake to the public. How did your development with Silent Hill 2 influence how you designed levels for this game?</strong></p>



<p>We are sharing our experiences for sure. We provide each other with feedback, so we try to learn our lessons. During development, as you can imagine, there's a lot of iteration going around. You play test and iterate and so on and so on. But we also wanted to make our own thing. I like the analogy from the presentation, that pizzas have different toppings and there is no superior pizza. We want to cook a little bit differently, just to separate ourselves from the other projects we're doing.</p>



<p><strong>The city setting here is something that Western players might not be very familiar with in terms of Poland. Is there one piece of media, whether a movie or book, that you feel represents the city and the time period seen in the story?</strong></p>



<p>That's a good question. There's a lot of old Polish socialist era stuff. Something specific for Krakow... It's hard to commit to one thing, at least from my perspective, because actually being there is probably the best way, to just visit, if you want to feel this atmosphere.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Cronos-The-New-Dawn-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Fair enough. During my demo playthrough, I ran into one enemy wearing a shirt that was obviously modeled from The Medium. What sort of other Easter eggs have you tossed in there from previous Bloober games?</strong></p>



<p>If you look closely enough, some comic books can be familiar, let's put it that way. But there are a couple more Easter eggs later on, and I will leave them for you to discover.</p>



<p><strong>You've surely played through a lot of Cronos yourself. What do you think is the most effective way to survive?</strong></p>



<p>You mentioned that you used the flamethrower as a defensive tool. I actually rather use it offensively or in a set-up situation, like, oh, maybe I will use merge to my advantage to bait one of those. Perhaps that's the tip I will share on how to overcome some challenges—use some situation to your benefit that might not be as obvious.</p>



<p><strong>In closing, is there one type of encounter or level you feel most passionate about, like you think it's your best work in the game?</strong></p>



<p>I can't really share what's ahead of you, but yeah, there's for sure something that puts your pressure up. There are a couple of places, but I can't really spoil it.</p>



<p><strong>Understandable. Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

There’s a crossover event on the way.

Fans have taken to social media to point out what look to be telltale signs of slop, and the evidence is pretty convincing. But here’s the thing: even if this isn’t AI, or wasn’t produced entirely by AI, the fact that we’re reflexively scanning the minutiae of various images speaks to the state of fear this rampant technology is instilling in us.

To play the contrarian that I am for a brief moment, I’ve spent enough time in Photoshop to know that quick comp work that’s often done on a tight deadline due to corporate demands <em>can</em> produce similar effects. Assets get borrowed from previous work, and how layers intersect with one another isn’t always paid direct attention to. </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Blizzard to verify whether or not the image is AI, but did not hear back prior to publication.</p><p>When humans produce similarly weird things, it’s usually an oversight, and in marketing, that does happen more often than you probably think. When AI does it, it’s because it doesn’t understand the image it’s creating. It’s just using patterns of pixels it’s digested from gobbling up other people’s art. </p><p>As many folks have pointed out, another reason why it’s highly likely that this is produced by AI is that Microsoft owns Blizzard by way of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469">Activision purchase a couple of years ago</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft <em>loves</em> AI</a></span>. And it’s particularly sucky, as <em>Hearthstone</em> fans have highlighted, that the game “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prides itself on its artwork</a></span>.” </p><p>Swim around in this same Reddit comment thread or elsewhere on the internet, and you’ll find some pushback to fans’ concerns. These people’s counterarguments essentially boil down to “Who cares?” Or the assertion that some people just always need something to complain about, and AI is just another thing for folks to score virtue-signaling points on the internet with. </p><p>To that, I’d say not so fast. </p><p>It’s so obvious that AI has been created and deployed specifically to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>eliminate</em> labor</a></span> (and with seemingly zero concern for the potentially irreversible energy impact on our dying planet, Cloud), that the deep concerns so many feel are not just about weird melty hands and odd ear physiology. They’re about what those things <em>represent</em>, what message this medium is communicating to those of us who value humanity in the artistic process or desire to become masters of art forms ourselves, and the fact that companies with massive power are doing what they can to restrict our abilities to sustain our lives, emotionally or financially, with said art. </p><p>This art, if it is indeed created by AI, tells us that our creations don’t have value and that those who make them are no longer needed. You can be indifferent to that, but it is what’s being said, and it is <em>not</em> the world many of us wish to live in.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for The Thing, the ability's usefulness depends on the person playing Human Torch, as they are essentially the driver of the ability and in full control. That's leading to some annoying (but admittedly funny) scenarios where Human Torch players are trolling Thing players by encouraging them to team-up and then swiftly sending them flying off the map to their death. You can see some terrible (or great) examples of that below.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, First Steps (when used normally) is a decent team-up ability that's great for locking down an objective or diving onto enemy players. That's more than can be said of some team-up abilities, which run the gamut between extremely powerful and largely useless. An example of a less-than-great team-up is Hulk and Wolverine's Fastball Special, which is similar to First Steps in that it lets Hulk pick up Logan and hurl him through the air.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-3-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6762/" data-ref-id="2900-6762">Marvel Rivals Season 3</a> launched July 11 and added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">Jean Grey (aka Phoenix)</a> to the game's ever expanding roster, with Blade set to be added later in the season.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vile-exhumed-steam-removed-sexual-content</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-horror-game-vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam-due-to-sexual-content.1255383/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Solo game dev Cara Cadaver has revealed that her indie horror game&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has been banned from Steam, and having played the game myself, I can tell you the reason is...a little strange.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77/status/1949867514797707531" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>, Cadaver says that <i>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</i>was banned from Steam for "sexual content with depictions of real people". As she points out, the game wasn't banned for "its use of gore in storytelling, or the violent themes".</p>

<p>The twist? As Cadaver says in her post, the sexual content for which the game was taken off Steam is "all implied". There's no explicit depiction of any kind of sexual act within the game; there are plenty of shocking and disturbing images, and the narrative is pretty unsettling, but that's about it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=uotDK6lT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-steam-banned-emails.jpg?itok=5CF3h4y2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to Steam anytime soon, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>Cadaver says she doesn't want to censor&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>or make changes to it; she says she "will not retell a story about these topics in a way to make people who don't understand it more comfortable".</p>

<p>Together with publisher DreadXP, Cadaver says she's currently looking into alternate ways to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, and you can expect to hear "specific details" next week. Make sure to check out Cadaver's X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/dirtlord77" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">account</a> or <a href="https://x.com/dreadxpgames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that of DreadXP</a> for further info.</p>

<p>For context, Steam delisted a bunch of adult games from its platform earlier this month, citing concern from payment processors regarding the explicit content present in those games. Indie platform Itch.io <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itch-io-deindexes-adult-pages" rel="nofollow">quickly followed suit</a>&nbsp;(although the original version of&nbsp;<em>Vile&nbsp;</em><a href="https://final-girl-games.itch.io/vile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remains intact</a> on that site, ironically).</p>

<p>It all stems from a <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a> started by activist group Collective Shout regarding a game by the name of&nbsp;<em>No Mercy</em>, an explicit title the group says "fl[ies] in the face of efforts to address violence against women".</p>




<p>The decision to remove Cadaver's game from Steam is, frankly, bizarre. If the point, as Collective Shout sees it, is to "address violence against women", then removing a game that directly tackles this theme in a frank and open way seems like a big mistake to me.</p>

<p>Of course, it's entirely likely that Steam simply panicked and pulled the plug on any game that might stand even the slightest chance of upsetting its payment processors, even if that game is about as far from "fl[ying] in the face of efforts to address violence against women" as it's possible to be.</p>

<p>Hopefully, Cadaver and DreadXP can find a way to release&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>somewhere else. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer" rel="nofollow">read my review</a> to find out why it's not only an important game from a message standpoint, but also a great experience in its own right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. This otherwise random subset of Secret Lair drops all appear to be sci-fi themed, thematically connecting them to the newest set, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>



<p>On the official <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/en/chaosvault#filter-product-1246458|sort-availability_wotc,featured" rel="nofollow">Secret Lair website</a>, there are eight new Chaos Vault drops. Four of those drops contain five cards taken from the <em>Edge of Eternities</em> set. The other four, called Commander Reinforcements, include an <em>Edge of Eternities</em> Commander deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=A4moVVNN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-alien-auroras-promo-image.jpg?itok=KpsIRvFe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first two drops are titled <em>Alien Auroras</em>. This drop features, in both foil and non-foil, five cards with evocative artwork by Ian Permana. The drop contains the following cards:</p>

<ul><li><em>Reprocess</em></li>
	<li><em>Aggressive Mining</em></li>
	<li><em>Sylvan Safekeeper</em></li>
	<li><em>Crucible of Worlds</em></li>
	<li><em>Zuran Orb</em></li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=iin6Yq-W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-secret-lair-chaos-vault-featuring-deathburger-promo-art.jpg?itok=lBiLxBb4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For those who appreciate the elegance of machinery over flesh, the second drop, <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> may be for you. As the name implies, this foil and non-foil drop features Josan Gonzales aka Deathburger's, provocative cyberpunk artwork. The cards he has reinterpreted are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Ethersworn Canonist</em></li>
	<li><em>Goblin Engineer</em></li>
	<li><em>Dance of the Manse&nbsp;</em></li>
	<li><em>Arcbound Ravager</em></li>
	<li><em>Foundry Inspector</em></li>
</ul><p>The second half of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops are mostly for those with deep pockets and a love for Commander. The <em>Commander Reinforcements: World Shaper</em> drop contains everything from the Alien Auroras drop as well as the World Shaper Commander Deck.</p>

<p>Similarly, <em>Commander Reinforcements: Counter Intelligence</em> includes everything from the <em>Featuring: Deathbringer&nbsp;</em>drop and the Counter Intelligence Commander deck.</p>

<p>The <em>Alien Auroras</em> and <em>Featuring: Deathburger</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $29.99 (non-foil) and $59.99 (foil), respectively. The <em>Commander Reinforcements</em> drops are being sold at MSRPs of $74.98 (non-foil) and $104.98 (foil). These drops will only be available while supplies last. If you are interested in any of these drops, and have the cash to spare, it is better to secure yours now.</p>

The prompts will be shown to Xbox players who indicate they’re over the age of 18 and will be shown when you sign into an Xbox account in the UK. Microsoft says it’s also exploring bringing similar age verification tools to other countries in the future.</p><p>To power the age verification in the UK, Microsoft is partnering with Yoti, which is one of the services that hasn’t fallen victim to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord"><em>Death Stranding</em> photo mode bypass</a>. While the age verification checks are optional right now, they will become a requirement to access a variety of Xbox services in early 2026, when additional parts of the UK’s Online Safety Act <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/important-dates-for-online-safety-compliance">come into force</a>.</p><p>“Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites,”<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/"> explains Kim Kunes</a>, vice president of gaming trust and safety at Xbox. If you don’t verify your age between now and early next year, social features “will become limited to friends only” until the age verification process has been completed.</p><p>“Whether a player verifies their age will not affect any previous purchases, entitlements, gameplay history, achievements, or the ability to play and purchase games, however we encourage players to verify their age via this one-time process now to avoid uninterrupted use of social features on Xbox in the future,” Kunes says.</p><p>While this is limited to Xbox players in the UK right now, Kunes says, “We expect to roll out age verification processes to more regions in the future.” Microsoft isn’t revealing which other regions will get similar age verification requirements, but Kunes does note that “these methods may look different across regions and experiences.”</p><p>If you’re in the UK, then you can verify your age for your Xbox account <a href="https://aka.ms/XboxUKAgeVerification">online through Microsoft</a>, where you can use a selfie, a scan of your passport or driver’s license, a credit card check, or a mobile number.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/714458/microsoft-xbox-age-verification-uk-social-features]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Last week, Itch.io <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisted thousands of games featuring various kinds of "NSFW" material</a>, rendering them invisible to anybody searching or browsing the site. Other developers reported that their games had been taken offline entirely. Among the games delisted was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mouthwashing">Mouthwashing</a>, Rock Paper Shotgun's game of the year 2024. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In a statement, Itch.io explained that they had delisted or removed NSFW games in response to pressure from payment processors and a campaign from Australian activist organisation Collective Shout, who broadly want games that glorify sexual violence and the sexualisation of girls removed from sale, but who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">also have connections</a> to certain right-wing Christian groups that aim to abolish legal sex work and punish queer sexual expression.</p>
<p>Collective Shout had previously succeeded in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">forcing Valve to change their Steam policies</a> to give banks and payment processors control over the definition of "adult" content on Steam. A number of Steam games have been delisted or removed from sale as a consequence, though nothing like the deluge of de-indexification we've seen on Itch.io.</p>
<p>Many of Itch.io's delistings may be temporary. The platform holders may re-index them following "a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors". Once the audit is done, they'll implement "new compliance measures" whereby NSFW game creators "must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".
</p>
<p>
Ahead of announcing any new regulations, Itch.io have <a href="https://itch.io/docs/creators/faq#is-adult-content-allowed">silently updated their developer terms and conditions</a> with "a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks". Devs will need to comply with that list in order to publish their work on Itch.io. It's rather open-ended, even without the caveat that it is "non-exhaustive". Here you go:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li>
<li>Underage or "barely legal" themes</li>
<li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li>
<li>Bestiality or animal-related</li>
<li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li>
<li>Sex trafficking implications</li>
<li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li>
<li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., "scat," "vomit")</li>
</ul>
<p>
To continue my thoughts on Collective Shout's arguments from last week, I don't think games that glorify rape and actively contribute to a culture of would-be or actual rapists deserve exposure on storefronts like Itch.io or Steam. Still, there's nothing in this list to distinguish such a game from a game that tells a story about rape without endorsing it, or from a BDSM fantasy that stresses the importance of consent in real-life sex. "Sexual trafficking implications" is similarly ambiguous as to whether a game is allowed to feature trafficking as a plot theme without advocating for it.</p>
<p>Still, I can say with some confidence that Mouthwashing infringes on some of these prohibitions. So, I would argue, do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Ground Zeroes, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Sonic The Hedgehog 2006, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crush-house">The Crush House</a>, Mortal Kombat, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, and Viva Pinata. Itch claim that they are reviewing games case by case, but still, if your work is remotely NSFW, perhaps it would be safest to avoid releasing games on Itch.io for the time being.
</p>
<p>Collective Shout have now confirmed that they "called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women". They have also, interestingly, distanced themselves from many of the Itch delistings, arguing that they didn't demand that the platform remove "all" NSFW content, and that they are now receiving additional abuse and threats online as a consequence.</p>
<p>"We called on Itch.io to remove rape and incest games that we argued normalised violence and abuse of women," Collective Shout <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history">write</a>. "Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content. Our objections were to content that involved sexualised violence and torture of women." They also cite an article in The Australian from 26th July in which founder Melinda Tankard Reist claims (in the paper's paraphrase) that Itch have gone "far beyond her request to ban sexually violent games".</p>
<p>As with the Steam delistings, Collective Shout's case might be stronger if they published full details of the individual games they've asked Itch.io to delist, and why they consider them harmful - particularly given their track record for mischaracterising other games they've tried to have removed from sale, like GTA 5 and Detroit: Beyond Human. It might also help if they voiced their support for the many queer creators who've been swept up by Itch.io's mass-delisting, in keeping with their <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/festival_campaign">previous condemnations of homophobia</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review.1255347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most devastating part about Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is just how short it falls of fulfilling such an insanely promising premise. I mean, which Tolkien nerd among us hasn’t daydreamed about living a relaxing life as a halfling? But instead of the warmth and comfort of the Shire, I spent 25 hours feeling like I was marching through the Dead Marshes in this cozy misadventure. It’s regrettably dull from start to finish, and runs so badly I wasn’t even allowed to be bored out of my mind in peace. The barebones life sim mechanics offer some of the most shallow versions of classic activities like fishing and farming that we’ve seen done much better in dozens of other games, and building social links with the inhabitants of Bywater is monotonous, repetitive, and never worth the effort. There’s at least some humorous writing and fun moments here and there, and the cooking minigame that serves as the main progression activity thankfully has slightly more depth than the other chores you do, but the few bright spots that exist are drowned out by one of the most disappointing cozy games I played since the Second Age. I went into Tales of the Shire thinking I’d be as happy as Denethor seeing Boromir, but I got Faramir instead.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though it rarely succeeds in the attempt, Tales of the Shire mostly follows the blueprint of games like Animal Crossing and Disney Dreamlight Valley, with stress-free slice of life activities in a quiet village as the main draw. You’ll try your hand at lesser versions of the usual fishing, gardening, and cooking minigames as you improve your relationships with your fellow townsfolk – all wrapped in a Tolkien skin that plays with the characters and locations found in The Lord of the Rings. The minimalistic story puts you in the hairy feet of a hobbit who’s recently moved to Bywater and begins to establish themself in the community, all while fixing up the rundown hobbit hole you’re given. You’ll meet some recognizable characters like Gandalf and Rosie Cotton and run samey errands for your neighbors in an attempt to get Bywater officially recognized as a village. As is often the case with games like this, it’s not much of a story, but has some likeable characters and amusing moments here and there as the goofy cast of hobbits bicker and squabble over trivial things that only a hobbit would bother caring about. Unfortunately, a complete absence of voice acting inhibits this high point; it just never quite felt right for such colorful and well-known characters to be completely silent throughout the story’s roughly 15-hour runtime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Tales lacks those hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the great things about the life sim genre is that, although they can appear fairly superficial at first, the longer you play, the more you discover hidden layers of depth to get completely lost in. Unfortunately, Tales lacks this essential component. At the point where I’d usually expect to enter an impossible-to-put-down chain of easygoing activities as I build out a quiet, virtual life for myself, it instead had me scratching my head as to what the point of all the monotonous busywork they’d saddled me with even was. That’s mainly because, despite featuring lots of cooking, Tales has very little meat on the bones for the vast majority of its mechanics, like how the best way to make money is to slowly walk back and forth across the very small map, picking up the same very small handful of foragable goods, then selling them so you can buy a single cut of bacon to use in cooking. The only time anything changes is when the seasons shift every dozen or so in-game days and you get a few new ingredients to find and crops to plant, but there’s a whole heck of a lot of tiresome grinding in between those shifts, which ultimately only alter the ingredients you’re collecting and the look of the village anyway.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Cozy Games</h3><p>If you're looking for a game that pairs well with a warm blanket and a hot cup of tea, look no further than these TieGuyTravis-approved recommendations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly every activity you’re expected to grind, from fishing to gardening, suffers from this same infuriating lack of depth. For example, you can only fish in a few spots around the map, and doing so yields the same very small handful of fish with little to augment or evolve your angling over time. When I unlocked my first fishing rod upgrade after completing numerous fishing-based quests, I was hopeful this would expand the number of fishing holes accessible to me or let me catch a whole new roster of sea creatures, but only moments later those hopes were dashed as I returned to the same places and caught the exact same fish I’d been reeling in for hours. And since you’re given tons of humdrum quests that require quite a lot of fishing to complete, you’re subjected to a whole lot of tedious repetition with very little in the way of payoff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Really the only exception is the cooking minigame, which serves as the main activity that all the others seem built to support and is much more substantial as a result. Fishing, foraging, gardening, taking care of chickens, and buying ingredients are all just a means to an end for your ever-hungry hobbit, and all of the components you gather are brought back to your home to combine into a dish you’ll then use to curry favor with other hobbits. You’re able to invite a few of your neighbors to share a meal with you once per in-game day, and after learning their preferences and cravings, you’ll have to mix together the right combination of flavors to maximize how much your cooking causes them to like you. Doing so levels up your social links, which awards ingredients and new recipes that open up new possibilities, and even occasionally result in a short conversation between you and whichever hobbit you’ve charmed – a decent payoff to your investment in a game that doesn’t respect your time in most other areas. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re subjected to a lot of tedious repetition with very little payoff.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, Tales still doesn’t really nail this minigame either, as the actual game part isn’t very good and is overly simplistic, especially in the first dozen or so hours before you unlock additional cooking tools that add a tad more nuance to the process. For example, unlocking the sauce pan allows you to stir different seasonings into your dishes that augment the flavor profile. Plus, you’re required to take on a ton of very boring chores just to get the ingredients you need, and then there’s a good chance you’ll just be waiting around for the next day to come before you can invite new people, since there are so few things to do aside from the time-gated meals. But cooking and the social elements it triggers are at least a relative highlight in a life sim that is so consistently underwhelming, and it does evolve over time in a way that the other activities don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond the grind of gathering ingredients, cooking meals, and feeding them to the residents of Bywater, you’ll also improve and decorate your little slice of the Shire. The home you’re given is pretty rundown at the outset, but is expanded and fixed up as you complete activities, the most important of which is the ability to raise chickens that generate eggs and gain access to more farm space. Unfortunately, although it’s nice to have more room and other small improvements like an actual working front door that takes way too long to unlock, there’s not a lot of interesting things to do with the additional space you’re given indoors. You gradually unlock decorations by completing quests, but there isn’t a ton of variety to them, zero functionality to adding things like new shelves and whatnot, and the entire layout of your home is static, so you have to just work around an existing floorplan that doesn’t offer much room for expression. This means that yet another component that’s usually a major draw in life sim games feels like only the minimum amount of effort was put into it. The good news is that the home you’re given definitely nails the Shire aesthetic when it’s fully upgraded, and even if there’s not many exciting options for personalization, it at least gets the job done when it comes to fulfilling part of the hobbit fantasy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Tales of the Shire were a more interesting game than it is, it would still be pretty hard to play purely by how unacceptably bad it runs. With constant framerate hitches, pop-in, aliasing, hard crashes, and other wonky stuff that suddenly broke, I never went more than a few minutes without something going terribly wrong. The worst of it was the consistent and repeated crashes throughout my play time that forced me back to my desktop, resulting in half an hour of lost progress as I had to start the entire day over. This often happened right after I completed sharing a meal with my halfling homeys, which requires quite a bit of prep work and planning, making it just about the worst time for a crash to happen. At one point I repeated a single day five times (totaling several hours of game time), with a crash happening at the end of the day each time, to the point where I wondered if I’d permanently broken something and wouldn’t be able to progress any further. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the issues, like how inconsistent the framerate is and how objects pop up right in front of your face, are more confusing than anything else – I mean, this does not seem like a particularly demanding game and I played on a high-end PC. It’s such a bummer, specifically because the painterly art style and iconic setting of the Shire has so much potential, and almost none of that comes through when you’re seeing shrubbery pop up right in front of you as you walk around town. Then there’s the one-off bugs, like one time where my fishing line stayed in the water when I was done fishing, and it wouldn’t let me put away my rod, so I walked around Bywater with a hilariously long fishing line stretching across the entire map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also tried out a little bit of the Switch version and, well, let’s just say that I’d have to write a whole separate review to talk about how especially awful of an experience that was. It’s worth mentioning that near the tailend of my time with Tales of the Shire, there was an update that did improve some of the framerate issues slightly, so there’s at least hope that it will run better in the future after some patching up. But even after the most recent update, it still doesn’t run great.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game is the Grima Wormtongue of games: it whispered many wonderful promises into my ear, but by the end I was left a wretched shadow of my former self. I had a lot of hope that this could be the perfect mix of a genre I love and the Tolkien world I’ve spent much of my life nerding out about, but those hopes were cast into the fires from whence they came. With life sim mechanics that are shallow as they come, terrible technical performance, and almost nothing original to say, Tales of the Shire disappoints every step of the way. There’s hints of a better game to be found in its slightly more robust cooking mechanics, as well as the occasionally amusing writing and dialogue that prove this setting was indeed ripe for a life sim if executed better – but like a Silmaril, those dreams have vanished deep in the depths of Angband.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The people yearn to hike and porter, according to newly released Death Stranding 2 statistics. Director Hideo Kojima has reported that just under 80% percent of players (called "someones" by Kojima) who finished the game continued past the credits. He did not report how many players this represents, but did share a variety of other statistics concerning player behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Kojima tweeted these details out as part of a post celebrating the game's one-month anniversary. It might not surprise you that the assault rifle was Death Stranding 2's most equipped weapon or the ladder its most equipped tool. But the statistics do include some of Death Stranding 2's sillier features. Out of all the animals players could rescue, they saved kangaroos the most (followed by emus and wombats). Via signage, players placed the "speed up" sign the most often. The post doesn't list any player count statistics, but Death Stranding 2 is popular. The game topped <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-and-rematch-top-the-ps5-charts-in-june-2025/2900-6742/">the PS5 charts in June</a>. The statistics also emphasize the game's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-on-the-beach-community-build/1100-6533237/">asynchronous multiplayer</a>, where players build structures and place tips to help each other.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2.<br>It’s been a month since release. It seems many players have already reached the ending. Since all the “Someones” around the world are connected through SSS, we’re able to gather a variety of data.

He wrote, "To everyone who has reached the ending: The world today is in a difficult state. It might be hard to hold on to hope for tomorrow. But know that there is someone out there who would risk their life to protect you—Even if you don’t notice, someone is connected to you, watching over you."</p><p dir="ltr">If you are one of the "someones" who completed Death Stranding 2, check out GameSpot's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-ending-new-game-plus-post-credits/2900-6733/">ending explained guide</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-suing-tencent-for-alleged-%E2%80%9Cslavish-clone%E2%80%9D-of-its-horizon-series-light-of-motiram.1255317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has launched a lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement against Tencent over what it calls a "<em>slavish clone</em>" of its Horizon game series, Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>Light of Motiram was first announced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">November 2024</a>, and it was immediately obvious to anyone even remotely familiar with the Horizon series that Motiram was at the very least drawing inspiration from Horizon, and that's being extremely generous with the comparisons. Being more appropriate and less generous, Motiram looked like a flat-out copy-paste job with a few changes in details and a new name.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Tencent debuted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-shown-in-new-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer for Light of Motiram</a>, which did very little to show that Motiram was its own unique game compared to Horizon. Now, a report from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/sony-sues-tencent-allegedly-ripping-off-horizon-video-games-2025-07-28/">Reuters</a> reveals that Sony was paying attention to Light of Motiram, and to how media pegged it as a Horizon copy. According to Reuters report, Sony's complaint includes how the media described it as a "<em>knock-off</em>," even including the phrase "<em>Horizon Zero Originality</em>." </p>



<p>Sony also claims that Tencent had approached Sony with an offer to work on a Horizon game in 2024, which Sony declined.</p>



<p>We, as outsiders looking at Light of Motiram, might have seen it as a copycat of Horizon, but that's ultimately a public opinion. Proving it in court is a different matter entirely, as Nintendo is finding out with its attempt at suing <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">Palworld makers PocketPair</a>. Needless to say, it'll be interesting to see how the case goes, and the kind of precedent it sets for the future of the industry.</p>

Veterans will know this is a feature that gives players special rewards. This can be in an item drop or an event, but it’s also how Game Freak sometimes delivers special Pokémon to players.<em> Legends: Z-A</em> will give early adopters a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite so it can Mega Evolve when it reaches its final form. The Publisher Information description explains how the player can acquire this gift, and notes that they will have to get about an hour-and-a-half into the game to access something called the “Link Play” menu.<em> Legends: Arceus</em> didn’t have this menu, even when it let players trade critters, and the term “link” has a specific connotation in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, as the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> games allowed you to play against other players with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Link Cable</a></span>.

If you scroll down a little further, you’ll see it specified that <em>Legends: Z-A </em>only supports one player. At least, that’s what it says on the North American store. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000094233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Japanese eShop</a></span> mentions that it will confirm online and local player numbers at a later time.

It’s entirely possible we hear more about the game then, and given that the competitive community will have its eyes locked on the show, that seems as good a time as any to announce multiplayer if it exists. For now, however, we’re left with more questions. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158]]></content:encoded>
