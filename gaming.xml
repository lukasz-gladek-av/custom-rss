            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="476">If you’ve ever wanted a device that’s easier to handle than a full-sized tablet but still larger and more capable than your phone, the iPad Mini fits perfectly into that sweet spot. It’s designed for people who want portability without giving up power or versatility. Whether you’re a creative professional, a student, or someone who just enjoys relaxing on the couch while scrolling for hours on end, the iPad Mini delivers a balanced experience that works in almost any situation.</p>
<p data-start="478" data-end="806">Right now, the 2024 Apple iPad Mini is even more appealing thanks to a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">The 128GB device is currently available at 20% off, which means you save $100 off the original $499 price</a>. That brings the cost down to just $399, making it one of the best times to grab Apple’s most compact tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="808" data-end="841">Big Power in a Compact Design</h2>
<p data-start="843" data-end="1253">The iPad Mini features an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that packs all the quality you expect from an iPad into a smaller, more comfortable form factor. It’s light enough to hold with one hand, making it ideal for reading, browsing, or sketching on the go. The display itself is sharp, vibrant, and designed with ultra-low reflectivity, so it remains easy to see even in bright lighting or outdoor conditions.</p>
<p data-start="1255" data-end="1689">Under the hood, the iPad Mini is powered by Apple’s A17 Pro chip. This processor delivers solid speed and efficiency, allowing the device to handle demanding tasks without slowing down. From multitasking to creative work, everything feels smooth and responsive. Apps launch quickly, transitions are fluid, and performance stays consistent whether you’re editing photos, watching videos, or bouncing back and forth between multiple apps.</p>
<p data-start="1691" data-end="2121">On the front, you’ll find a 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage. This feature is especially useful for video calls on FaceTime, Zoom, or other conferencing apps, as it automatically keeps you centered in the frame—even if you move around or someone else joins you in view. On the back, the 12MP camera supports 4K video recording and makes scanning documents quick and easy.</p>


<p data-start="2123" data-end="2436">Thanks to the A17 chip, the iPad Mini also offers fast Wi-Fi connectivity and smooth performance for everyday tasks like taking notes, marking up documents, editing photos or videos, and even gaming. With iPadOS, you can boost productivity further by running two apps side by side using split-screen multitasking. It runs a number of apps such as Microsoft 365 and Adobe Photoshop, as well as graphics-heavy games, without any issues.</p>
<p data-start="2438" data-end="2949">Optional accessories like the Apple Pencil Pro and Smart Folio (sold separately) enhance the experience even more. The Apple Pencil Pro allowing you to write, draw, or edit with precision, while the Smart Folio protects the screen and doubles as a stand for hands-free viewing.</p>
<p data-start="2951" data-end="3376" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">To top it all off, the iPad Mini is available in four stylish colors—purple, starlight, space gray, and pink. You can also choose between 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage, along with Wi-Fi-only or Wi-Fi + Cellular models. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6610/">With Wi-Fi-only versions discounted by $100, this sale makes it possible to pick up the latest iPad Mini for as little as $399,</a> making it an excellent value for a powerful, ultra-portable tablet.</p>

<p>Regardless, I've had quite the ride thus far with my Switch 2. We're still not that far out from launch, and I expect super-duper exciting things in 2026. Loads of 'em. I can smell it. Oh no, wait, that was just my dog.</p>
<div><p>Now, while I haven't had the opportunity to review <em>all</em> of the biggest and best games released for the console in 2025, the ones I have cast my eye over make for a super solid list - with a few absolute stinkers thrown in for good measure. There's always at least one stinker thrown in for good measure. <strong>*points at dog*</strong></p><p>

With all of this in mind — and having recently revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">our cumulative NL staff picks</a> — I thought it might be useful to take a look at my top three Switch 2 games of 2025, in no particular order, selected from <em>just</em> the titles that I personally spent time reviewing. Yeah? Might as well give it a go now I've gone this far, eh. I'll even give it a jaunty title.

<h2>PJ's Top 3 Games From The 25 Switch 2 Games Wot He Reviewed On Switch 2 In 2025 (In no particular order)</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a></h3>
<p>I'm not having any more of this "Musou games are braindead button-mashers" patter out of you, son. I don't care if it's Christmas; that tired old line has been wrong for a while now, and in case you weren't aware, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a> makes this very clear.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days of bland, barren maps populated by one-trick CPU enemies. No more are the tired side quests, lack of challenge, lack of variety, lack of combat strategising...and all that other guff that people <em>say</em> us Musou fans have had to endure over the years. This is a big, bold, and beautiful <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a> adventure that earns every bit of its "official canon" legitimising from the Big N.</p>

<p>This entry learns lessons and takes stock from what went a little wrong last time out, namely that crucial balance between story and combat. The rectifying of this one crucial aspect would have been enough for me, but with the extra grunt of the Switch 2 we also get an absolute looker that's always a pure joy to sit down and blast through. It's so slick and smooth!</p>
<p>My favourite Musou game thus far? Yep, it knocks that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_warriors_three_hopes">Fire Emblem</a> effort out of pole position and everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:192867 @ 1767101883 -->
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></h3>
<p>Boof! I knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Ivalice Chronicles</a> was going to be good. Very good, even. I did not, however, expect to be swept away quite as hard as I was.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, you may be surprised to learn, is actually my favourite FF of the lot. It's just exactly everything I want in terms of combat, vibes and story. The trifecta...she complete! Yes, I know some folk have issues with the reframing and reorganising of the War of the Lions content in this latest cut, but I am actually a big fan of what they've done with this new version.</p>

<p>It feels cleaner, and in all honesty, I don't really need any more combat once I'm done with the main story as it was originally. The combat in the War of the Lions, well, it was just more gravy, nothing new. This snazzy new effort also does vitally important stuff like make cameras and controls easier and better to navigate with.</p>
<p>Battlefield views, tagging enemies, smarter CPU strategising all much-improved...this is genuinely making an already fantastic game a notably better one. It knocks the experience from <strong>Very Good Game™</strong> territory into the realms of things that are actually, genuinely, very difficult to find any fault with. And all of this in the palm of your hand on Switch 2. Hold me, mammy.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a></h3>
<p>I know I said this is in no particular order. But I sort of lied. The more I consider it, the more it becomes clear that nothing grabbed me in my pure gamer heart quite as much as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> did this year. It feels like the purest of pure sort of Nintendo magic that we Nintendo fans are forever pining after. Gies a wee sniff, mate. Go on. I just need one hit on that magic, son. Wheeeeeeee!</p>
<p>What has got me so engrossed in and excited about a semi-automated racer? Well, first of all, it's properly hard to fully master. Kirby's latest has depth for those who like it deep (phrasing), whilst also providing for the button-mashers and the low-attention-span fans. Stick at it, get used to its chaotic way of doing things, and you'll find a finely tuned racing beast purrs beneath the horror of giant neon pick-up icons. Yes, they are very big. I love them.</p>

<p>I've had some real sweaty finales (phrasing) during online matchups in this one, and all it takes is one other pro racer (or a whole bunch of you get lucky) to really awaken the magic. Once you've tasted the sweetness of a victory snatched from the jaws of defeat, a victory at what feels like 1000s of kilometres per hour through a cosmic chaos of Masahiro Sakurai's creation, it's very hard not be get fully hooked.</p>
<p>If I manage one thing this year — and really, I'm leaving it seriously late in the day but there's always hope — I'd be quite happy it be turning someone, anyone, on to the delights of Air Riders. It's a game that's easy to look at and nope out of. It's also a game that's easy to pick up, play, and walk away from as something that's just a big colourful mess for kids. But what's here beats out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for me in terms of online fun <em>and</em> competitiveness. It does <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Crossworlds</a> in as well. Kirby just has it exactly where it matters, and in exactly the right manner and style for me this year. So suck on that.</p>

              <p>Got yourself some lofty fitness goals as we enter the new year? It’s common to set a news years resolution that involves getting into better shape, but it can be hard to maintain these new routines past the first couple months of the year. The best way to stick to a fitness regimen is by collecting data. Seriously. Getting yourself a good GPS watch can provide you with the health insights and personal coaching that can keep you motivated to hit the gym all year long.</p>
<p>Right now, the Google Pixel Watch 4 is available for a solid discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/">The 41mm model (LTE) usually sits at about $450, but Amazon has it marked down to $350 for a short window.</a> That works out to a 22% price cut, putting an extra $100 back in your pocket. Additionally, you can grab the 45mm option also for $100 off, bringing it from $500 to just $400.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="413" data-end="654">The Pixel Watch 4 has a sleek, refined design with the functionality you’d expect from a daily wearable.&nbsp;As a fitness companion, the Google smartwatch functions like a personal coach. It suggests running workouts tailored to your goals, training history, and daily readiness. These customized plans help runners monitor their progress, making it easier to tackle longer distances and improve times. You can even create your own workouts, including warm-ups, cooldowns, and pace targets. Plus, saved runs let you track improvements and set new personal records.</p>
<p data-start="1113" data-end="1316">Beyond fitness, the watch tracks various health metrics like daily readiness scores, cardio load, and the FitBit Morning Brief, which offers insights into your recovery and helps you plan your day ahead. The Pixel Watch 4 also offers useful features like offline Google Maps, the ability to pay with Google Wallet, and seamless integration with other Pixel devices and smart home gadgets like a Google Nest hub.</p>


<h2 data-start="1527" data-end="1562"><strong data-start="1527" data-end="1562">What’s New in the Pixel Watch 4</strong></h2>
<p data-start="1564" data-end="1837">While the changes from the Pixel Watch 3 are subtle, there are some notable upgrades. The most noticeable difference is the curved display. While the Pixel Watch 3 did have curved glass, the screen beneath the glass on the Watch 4 is also curved, giving it a more distinct look.</p>
<p data-start="1839" data-end="1977">Battery life has also improved. The Pixel Watch 4 lasts up to 30 hours with the always-on display or up to 48 hours in Battery Saver mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘In This Age of Diversity, The Manufacturer Stubbornly Refused To Offer The Option’: Hideki Kamiya’s Solution To A Critical Nintendo Switch 2 Issue]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/in-this-age-of-diversity-the-manufacturer-stubbornly-refused-to-offer-the-option-hideki-kamiyas-solution-to-a-critical-nintendo-switch-2-issue/</link>
            <guid>1394272</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched this year after an extremely long wait that left much of the industry baffled, but this wait didn't prevent the system from becoming a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-2m-units-sold-in-us-ea-sports-college-football-tops-july-us-sales-charts/"><strong>smashing success</strong>.</a></p>



<p>However, it's undeniable that the new generation console by Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/"><strong>comes with some issues</strong></a>, including a <strong>long-standing controls issue</strong> which forced legendary game creator <strong>Hideki Kamiya</strong> to go to some <strong>extreme measures</strong> to fix: the <strong>lack of D-Pad on the Joy-Con controller</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/index_3.html#clo_kam">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a></strong> as part of its now traditional end-of-year wrap up with Japanese game developers, the creator of the <strong>Devil May Cry, Okami and Bayonetta</strong> series, among others, recounted his experience with the Nintendo Switch 2, finally managing to get his hands on a system only recently after purchasing a second system for his <strong>niece</strong>, who took his launch system for herself. Spending time with the system made Kamiya-san frustrated by the <strong>lack of a proper D-pad</strong> on the Joy-Con controllers.</p>



<p><em>"Even after it finally came back to me, for some reason, <strong>in this age of diversity, the manufacturer itself has stubbornly refused to offer the option of a 'Joy-Con with a D-pad'</strong> since the Switch 1. This just didn't fit into my gaming lifestyle, where I usually <strong>play while lying down</strong>, so I have no choice but to use the Joy-Con when playing games,"</em> he said, as translated by <strong><a href="https://x.com/stealth40k/status/2004712820403999129">Stealth</a></strong>, touching upon an issue many <strong>old-school gamers</strong> have had with the Nintendo Switch systems.</p>



<p>After continuing to use the original Switch for his daily <strong>Tetris 99</strong> fix and taking advantage of <strong>third-party peripherals</strong> with a proper D-pad, Kamiya-san decided to take matters into his own hands to make the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 his primary hardware</strong>. </p>



<p><em>"I purchased a new <strong>Cyber ​​Gadget 'mini grip with D-pad,'</strong> which I use with the Switch 1, and after some <strong>sanding and modifying</strong> it so that it could be attached to the Switch 2, where the <strong>button layout is slightly different</strong>, I was able to make my own <strong>'D-pad Joy-Con 2,'</strong> which finally allowed me to play titles from <strong>'Arcade Archives 2.'</strong>"</em></p>



<p>As someone who frequently plays old-school 2D games, I have long felt Hideki Kamiya's pain. Hopefully, Nintendo or third-party manufacturers will eventually address the issue and provide <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">more controller options</strong> for those who think a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">solid D-pad is an essential part</strong> of any controller. As the Japanese company itself offers access to a catalog of older games via the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch Online</strong> subscription, it would make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">considerable sense</strong>.</p>

              <p>When you find yourself with electricity, the first thing you want to do is find a power source. You can take one with you wherever you go with a portable power station. We’ve found a particularly useful one that you can use and save some money while you’re at it.</p>

            <guid>1394260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Find My app is an incredibly useful tool for keeping track of your belongings, and it’s something I’ve personally relied on more times than I’d like to admit. From the time I accidentally left my iPhone at a restaurant to when I forgot my MacBook under a coffee shop table, this app has been a lifesaver. Even when my Apple Watch fell into a river—I didn’t manage to find that one—but the app did confirm the watch was somewhere in that river (I should really keep better care of my stuff). It’s clear that the Find My app is an essential tool for keeping track of your Apple devices. And, if you’ve ever wondered if you could track more than just your iPhone or other Apple products, there’s good news—AirTags are here to help!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>AirTags are tiny, quarter-sized discs that can be attached to almost anything you own, making them just as easy to track as your iPhone or iPad. Whether it’s your keys, wallet, or even a gaming console like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, you can use these clever little gadgets to keep tabs on all your things. One of the most practical uses is for travel. If you’ve ever had your luggage go missing at the airport, placing an AirTag in your checked bags could save you days of stress and confusion.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about picking up some AirTags, Amazon currently has a great deal.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> Normally priced at $99 for a four-pack (which breaks down to about $25 per tag), they’re currently on sale for just $65.</a> This discount of 34% saves you $35, making each AirTag cost just about $16. It’s a pretty solid deal if you want to make sure your most important items are always within reach.</p>
<h2>Couldn’t Be Easier</h2>
<p>Setting up the AirTags is incredibly simple. All you need to do is tap one to your iPhone or iPad, and it will instantly pair with your device. Once connected, the AirTag will appear in the Find My app alongside your Apple devices. From there, you can give each AirTag a specific name to keep track of exactly what it’s attached to—like naming the one in your purse “Purse” or the one on your keys “Keys.” This way, you’ll always know what’s what.</p>
<p>If you ever find yourself searching for a lost item around the house and know it’s somewhere nearby, the Find My app lets you trigger the AirTag to play a sound. The AirTag has a built-in speaker that makes it easy to find your lost items, whether they’re buried under a pile of clutter or hidden between the cushions of your couch. It’s a simple but effective way to save time and frustration when you’re on the hunt for your stuff.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Yen, Chikara and much more.</p>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless is a comprehensive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-active-climb-and-jump-tower-codes-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG where players develop their anime-inspired fighter by training five core stats, mastering special abilities, and defeating increasingly powerful enemies. The main objective revolves around continuously improving your character through the game’s “endless” progression system, unlocking powerful anime-inspired abilities, and watching your fighter evolve into a formidable combatant.</p>







<p>Advancement hinges on five core stats—Strength, Durability, Chakra, Sword, and Speed—each unlocking different combat abilities as you progress. Players earn Yen as the primary currency from defeating enemies and completing quests, which is spent on multiplier upgrades that dramatically increase training efficiency. The game features a unique Champion gacha system using Chikara currency, where rare Champions like Serious Saitama can provide massive stat multipliers to accelerate your growth. While these resources can be accumulated through regular gameplay, the fastest way to jump ahead is by redeeming promotional codes. </p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, there are no expired codes, so players can redeem the active codes safely.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-anime-fighting-simulator-endless-codes">How To Redeem Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes Redemption Page | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, it is rather simple to redeem Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes. That being said, for players who may be new to the Roblox ecosystem, here is a step-by-step guide to redeeming Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot up Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless in Roblox</li>



<li>Find the arrow button in the bottom-left corner</li>



<li>Click on it to scroll through the menu</li>



<li>Find a blue icon, and click on it to open the code box</li>



<li>Type or paste a code into the text box</li>



<li>Click on enter and claim the freebie</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-where-to-get-more-anime-fighting-simulator-endless-codes">Where To Get More Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless Codes</h2>



<p>Anime Fighting Simulator: Endless codes are typically released through the game’s community and developer channels, but they don’t appear automatically in-game. The best places to catch them early are the official AFS: Endless Discord server, which has a dedicated codes channel where all new codes are posted first, and the developer’s social media accounts where they announce updates and milestones for this popular anime-inspired fighting game.</p>







<p>Codes often come out around game milestones but if you’re only checking sporadically, you’ll very easily miss them because no alert system tells players when a code drops—or when it stops working. Because of this, the easiest strategy is to save this guide in your browser and check back instead of trying to monitor every source yourself. This page is refreshed as soon as fresh codes go live, and any codes that have expired are taken out quickly so you always see only the ones that still work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Once I finished DOOM 2016 and DOOM: Eternal, I was excited to jump back in again. Less so Eternal, but it’s a fantastic sequel to the untouchable first reboot. DOOM: The Dark Ages is arguably the most complete and well-crafted of the trilogy, but I find it the least memorable and least replayable of the three.</p>



<p>In a bid to expand and evolve, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dark Ages</a> feels like an extension of its predecessors, more than a full-scale demonic overhaul. Furthermore, everything new mostly misses the mark, and can make the experience go from Imp to limp very quickly. id Software probably has an ideas board more bloated than a Mancubus after a Christmas Dinner, and there’s plenty of hope for the next trip to hell.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-won-t-spell-doom-for-the-franchise">It Won’t Spell DOOM For The Franchise</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A step back. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>I think DOOM is the quintessential first-person shooter franchise, as well as the most important one. Wolfenstein 3D helped the FPS genre crawl, but 1993’s DOOM stood on its own two feet—and throats of Baron of Hellish foes. Level design, music, the guns, the gore, and the thematic touches just exude a badass aura that few have even come close to.</p>



<p>Following DOOM 3’s survival-horror detour, there was a long wait for a new game. The infamous, canceled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concept-art-and-footage-surface-of-the-cancelled-doom-4-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM 4</a> project is better consigned to history, and thank our stars it was. We got the DOOM 2016 reboot instead—which I actually think is the best DOOM game everbut that’s for another conversation.</p>



<p>Eternal upped the speed and mobility and gave us Godmode Doomguy. I’ll never forgive the Marauders’ design, though, and I’ll die on that fiery hill! Both games are fantastic in their own unique right, and then you’ve got DOOM: The Dark Ages, which serves as a prequel. id Software decided to make its level design more open and chaotic, give us a Doomguy Dragon and Kaiju-inspired levels, and tighten up the game’s story with more cutscenes and character development.</p>



<p>In trying to do more, TDA does <em>too </em>much, and actually takes me away from the thing I enjoy most about DOOM: Killing lots of demons with fun weapons in small-to-medium-sized levels. But it’s still a good game!</p>







<h2 id="h-less-is-more-more-or-less">Less Is More, More Or Less</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good, large dragon doggie. Image via Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Long story short…I don’t prioritise story when it comes to DOOM, and I’m sure I’m not alone in that sentiment. DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 achieve so much through visual and environmental cues and clues. How am I supposed to rip and tear when you won’t let me rip and tear? The Dark Ages’ Dragon levels are cumbersome and uninteresting, and while I can appreciate the attempt to freshen things up, the Mecha Doomguy sections are boring. </p>



<p>The shield and the slower-shield-based parry gameplay are solid, but you’re always aware that it’s a conscious effort to slow the game’s pace down (not as much as the Marauder, grr), and negatively juxtaposes the game’s identity. I’m not saying I want Doomguy to go shopping for some Sonic the Hedgehog shoes and borrow a Titanfall jetpack, but there needs to be a balance. </p>



<p>Ironically, I believe that balance is still DOOM 2016.</p>



<p>id nailed everything with the game. I’d like to see the next DOOM game be more akin to 2016, and maybe borrow the odd bit of parkour from Eternal, and even some of The Dark Ages’ incredible visual aesthetic. It also wouldn’t hurt to broker peace with Mick Gordon, I beg. In the same way that DOOM 3 was starting to steer the ship away and veer off on a completely different course, I think the same needs to happen again now.</p>



<p>The series is as popular as ever, but it felt like everyone forgot about it as 2025 went on. Let’s fuse old-school and new-school DOOM again. Finding key cards in well-designed levels that don’t just rely on being open, and adding depth with hidden platforms and switches galore. A beastly soundtrack supported by grizzly battle scenes is also a must. Let’s waste less budget on theatrics and inject that into R&amp;D on fun gameplay mechanics and ideas, and re-reboot DOOM again.</p>



<p>What do you think id and Bethesda got wrong with DOOM: The Dark Ages? What needs to happen for the next iteration?

			<p>There is little doubt that the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> launched with <strong>far more third-party support</strong> than the original <strong>Switch</strong> did eight years ago. </p>



<p>Back then, the shift to a hybrid console was still a gamble, and Nintendo was coming off the colossal flop of the <strong>Wii U</strong>, which made third-party developers understandably wary of spending their precious resources on ports for the Switch. That meant only three third-party games were available in March 2017: Just Dance, Bomberman, and Skylanders. Not exactly heavy hitters. </p>



<p>Compare it with the Nintendo Switch 2 third-party launch lineup:</p>



<ul>
<li>Street Fighter 6 (Capcom)</li>



<li>Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (CD Projekt Red)</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Avalanche Software / WB Games)</li>



<li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess (Capcom)</li>



<li>Split Fiction (Hazelight / EA)</li>



<li>No Man's Sky – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (Hello Games)</li>



<li>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster (Konami)</li>



<li>Civilization VII – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition (2K / Firaxis)</li>



<li>Hitman: World of Assassination – Signature Edition (IO Interactive)</li>



<li>Sonic X Shadow Generations (Sonic Team / Sega)</li>



<li>Fortnite (Epic Games)</li>
</ul>



<p>The incredible success of the original Switch and Nintendo's smart choice to pursue what is essentially a 2.0 edition with its successor made it far easier for developers to invest in supporting Nintendo's platform. So easy, in fact, that the problem reversed itself: now, there were too many developers who wanted to get access to the Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/while-the-biggest-studios-have-gotten-priority-many-are-still-trying-to-get-a-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to the big studios obtaining priority access while many others were left wanting</a>, thus inevitably delaying their ability to release games on the console.</p>



<p>The situation <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-developers-access-nintendo-driect-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still hadn't improved by July</a>. As recently as early October, we received word <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-can-technically-do-path-tracing-war-thunder-dev-didnt-get-switch-2-devkit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an exclusive interview</a> that War Thunder developer Gaijin Entertainment had still not received its Nintendo Switch 2 developer kits. </p>



<p>Now, though, insider Nate the Hate (who had also confirmed in late August that many developers were still waiting for their kits) wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1py9h8n/natethehate_switch_2_devkit_availability_to_third/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the situation has 'largely been resolved'</a>.</p>



<p><em>In the case of Call of Duty… it doesn't mean they got a devkit super late, either. Just late enough that they couldn't get the work done to launch the game sooner. The devkit delivery situation has largely been resolved.</em></p>



<p>In the earlier portion of the statement, Nate was referring to <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jez Corden's recent rumor</a> that Activision is preparing to launch a Call of Duty game for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 soon, thus abiding by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year deal made by owner Microsoft with Nintendo</a> as part of the stipulations to get the Activision acquisition through the regulatory gates.</p>



<p>With more developers having access to Nintendo Switch 2 devkits, fans should prepare for a deluge of ports in 2026-2027, especially with the new console <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outpacing its predecessor in sales figures</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="5a6ceee95033b"><a title="Metroid Prime 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5a6ceee95033b/metroid-prime-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like other iconic Nintendo series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> has a timeline documenting Samus' space adventures from past to present. Although the newest outing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is very much its own thing, it is still part of the Prime series as a new chapter.</p>
<p>Outside of the first-person entries, it's now apparently been mentioned by Nintendo how this game fits within the <em>entire</em> history of the Metroid series. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211">Speaking to Famitsu</a> recently, Nintendo's development team reportedly told the famous Japanese gaming outlet how the latest Switch and Switch 2 outing is set <em>after</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> on the Super Nintendo and <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a> on the Game Boy Advance (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-timeline-placement/">thanks, Nintendo Everything</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4ceoyntxp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>In saying this, it's reiterated how the new entry takes place in "another dimension", meaning there is no need to worry about the timeline or possible impacts on the 2D Metroid series. As a result, players can jump into this new adventure without any prior knowledge and enjoy the original setting. It has been an 18-year wait between this game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Corruption</a>, after all.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review of Metroid Prime 4 here on Nintendo Life</a>, we also mentioned how newcomers would be able to enjoy this new adventure without having to understand the history of the series. If Nintendo, Retro Studios or a prominent Nintendo figure says anything else about how exactly Beyond fits within the Metroid timeline, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Arc System Works finally delivered the long-awaited Switch update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> earlier this month.</p>
<p>Now, in a new development update, it has addressed the future of this particular version of the game. It mentions how the Switch version has required "a great deal of effort and ingenuity" and as a result, the team is currently examining what exact form future updates "beyond Version 2.0" could take.</p>
<p>The feasibility of this is dependent on how far the development team can push itself, and if it's able to overcome technical challenges. Here's the message in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="myrpG5TN7_Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytmyrpG5TN7_Q" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myrpG5TN7_Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed53c808pqvrju&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>"Regarding the future of GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Developing and operating the game on Nintendo Switch required a great deal of effort and ingenuity to work within hardware constraints.</p>
<p>Based on that experience, we are currently examining what form future updates beyond Version 2.0 could take for the Nintendo Switch Edition.</p>
<p>Please note that feasibility will depend not only on technical challenges, but also on how far we can push ourselves as a development team, as well as on feedback and support from our players. All of these factors will be taken into account as we make our decisions."</p>

<p>Since arriving on the Switch and Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> has been acknowledging major sales milestones.</p>
<p>In a brief update on social media, Level-5 has confirmed it's now surpassed <strong>1.5 million</strong> copies in worldwide cumulative sales. As part of this, the developer is celebrating with a new illustration and a limited-time sale on the eShop.</p>

If you're a recent Switch 2 owner and are looking for a new RPG to play, look no further than the fantastic game that is Bravely Default.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster for $29.99</h2><div catalogid="681de1aa-cde5-4374-8e89-64521fd58645" id="233911"><div id="233911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>BRAVELY DEFAULT FLYING FAIRY HD Remaster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has discounted Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster to $29.99 with a limited-time deal, which marks the lowest we've seen this game to date. Originally released in 2013 for the Nintendo 3DS, Bravely Default follows four heroes across the world of Luxendarc as they attempt to reclaim the world's four crystals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bravely Default is a fascinating game for many reasons. It initially was set to be a Final Fantasy game, but it shifted mid-development into its own game despite retaining key elements of the series. Revo, best known for his work as Linked Horizon for Attack on Titan, composed the soundtrack, which is still, to this day, an incredible RPG soundtrack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster brought new minigames, a refreshed UI, and other solid quality-of-life features like fast-forward, encounter rate adjustments, and more. While this is unfortunately a Game-Key Card, the download is only 11GB, so you will not need much space available on your Switch 2 to download this one. This is one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-upcoming-nintendo-switch-games">best Switch 2 games</a> you can buy right now, so don't miss out on this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

<p>In the title’s latest game update, lines of code such as “via.store.Native.ns2UpgradeEdition” have <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/rumor-monster-hunter-wilds-update-gives-hope-for-a-nintendo-switch-2-version/">reportedly been added</a>.</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be that it’s a reference to a possible <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1pxw8id/potential_new_info_on_t_gog_possible_switch_2/#lightbox">"Switch 2 version" of the game</a>.

<p>The main concern among fans is tied to the game’s performance. When Wilds launched earlier this year in February, there were issues identified with this aspect of the title as well as the visuals on next-generation console hardware and PC. Capcom has rolled out multiple title updates since then, but hunters are still experiencing problems.</p>
<p>How Wilds would perform on a system such as the Switch 2 remains to be seen, but there have already been some stunning efforts on Nintendo's new device including CDPR's work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and Capcom has demonstrated its abilities with Street Fighter 6. Of course, there's no guarantee this discovery in Monster Hunter's latest update will necessarily lead to an announcement.</p>
<p>If you missed the news, Capcom has locked in multiple releases for the Switch 2 in 2026 (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">and beyond</a>). Some of these titles include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> in February, the spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> in March, and its new IP <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> in April.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ethan Gach’s Top 10 Games Of 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/best-games-2025-silksong-final-fantasy-tactics-9-kings-2000655728</link>
            <guid>1394107</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Is Aiming to Release a New Silent Hill Game in 2026, and in 2027, 2028, 2029, etc, “To Keep the Buzz Around Silent Hill Constant”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/</link>
            <guid>1394074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>

Off the rip, we're seeing new price drops on pre-built <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>, which are becoming all the more popular given the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concern-that-skyrocketing-ram-prices-driven-by-ai-needs-will-cause-problems-for-high-end-gaming-for-several-years">price increases on RAM alone</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has also bumped up its Pokémon TCG stock this holiday, but is anything worth buying? Of course it’s not. Well, there’s a handful of deals to be had, but the independent retailer army that makes up TCGPlayer is leading the way with the majority of the best prices on both the new and secondary market.</p><p id="tldr-deals-for-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" TL;DR: Deals for Today">TL;DR: Top Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech has dropped some cracking deals on a range of their prebuilt gaming PCs before New Year's Day, and we’re seeing RTX 5070 Ti builds for under $2,000 and RTX 5080 builds for under $2,800.

You’ll have solid 1080p gaming with either an Intel i5-14400F or AMD Ryzen 7 5700 processor to boot. Personally, I’d go for the <strong>Crystal</strong> build.

<section><p>In Silent Hill F, systemic violence gets bloody, embodied life.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening.</p><p dir="ltr">All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Silent Hill F Is Connected To The Rest Of The Series</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, Silent Hill f takes place both in a "real world," covered in fog and invaded by twisted human forms, and in an "other world," which distorts the real. Unlike its predecessors, the gap between the real world and the other world is clearly delineated. Whenever Hinako falls unconscious, she wakes up in the other world. At first, it would seem that her experiences in her hometown are "real" and her time in the other world, marked with Shinto monuments and dream mansions suspended over water, is fake. However, the game's first ending calls this binary into question. The sequence’s final moments reveal Hinako to be much older now than her appearance would suggest. The girl we've been playing the whole time is almost a psychic scream, a representation of the younger Hinako whose dreams were betrayed by the older.</p><p dir="ltr">What was that betrayal? Nothing but the rite promised to all women: marriage. Her parents have promised Hinako to a suitor to settle a family debt. The real world represents how the arrangement slowly strips away her connections to her friends, her family, and herself . The other world stands in for the process of her courtship. The process of playing Silent Hill f, at least in an initial playthrough, is the process of tearing Hinako apart along those axes. She is both victim and thief. One version of her weds the thing that drains the other's world of life.</p><p dir="ltr">In the other world, a mysterious man only called Fox Mask courts Hinako. After a few preliminary trials, including ritualistic killings of her close friends, Hinako descends a staircase to yet another set of ritual grounds. At each site, a new torture awaits. First, Hinako saws off her own arm, then cultists brand her back, and finally, they slice a portion of her face off and replace it with a fox mask of her own. It is easy enough, though gruesome, to write it out. But the visual presentation is grueling.</p><p dir="ltr">Before each ritual, the fox cult display the tools of their torture. Then, they go about their work. The camera work is unsparring, but off center. We see a medium close-up of Hinako's face as she pulls the saw across her shoulder, or blood spilling between her feet as one cultist carves a knife into her face. There is a sense of witnessing, wanting to avert your eyes, but not being able to look away. Like all of Silent Hill f's cutscenes, there are no interactive elements. Here, that fact underlines how Hinako is treated as an object, which Fox Mask and the cultists chisel to their own liking.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of words of comfort and strength from Fox Mask, the cultists are totally silent as they conduct the rituals. They communicate their intent only through gesture and presentation. The effect is almost like a pantomime. These rituals are familiar to everyone present except Hinako. The camera frames her alone, in ordinary schoolgirl clothes, totally surrounded. She is ignorant; the cultists are her teachers. They cut their lessons on her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hinako's violent transformation rings out across the rest of the game. For one, it acts as the most profound distinction between the two Hinakos. While the student Hinako wields baseball bats, pipes, and if she is lucky, a kitchen knife in the real world, the other Hinako gains a magnificent, monstrous fox arm, a spiritual weapon that will never decay or break. The brand lets her open new doors, while the mask sees hidden paths. The more Hinako becomes a bride, the more power she gains.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that power makes her more vulnerable. With each power, Hinako's "sanity" meter drains. Whether it is an accurate localization or not, I feel "sanity" does not accurately communicate how the mechanic works. One could also describe it as "will" or "resistance." Hinako's fox powers drain sanity and the regular food objects of the town restore it. It represents Hinako's willingness to give in to becoming a bride. The more Hinako embraces the fox, the more sanity she'll expend. The difference in how those mechanics impact the two different Hinakos makes an argument. Every time you use the arm, or regret its absence, you cannot help but think of Hinako's pain in acquiring it, of the tears of blood rolling down her cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">The ritual's horrifying power is something of a double-edged sword. In subsequent endings, the game turns redemptive. Fox Mask, actually a boy named Tsuneki Kotoyuki, is kind-hearted and well-meaning. Hinako reconciles her two selves. There aren't exactly any thematic problems with this. Fox Mask's good intentions are even a profound provocation. The system dehumanizes, however kind-hearted or well-meaning its agents are. Yet, Silent Hill f's ultimate run of boss fights and reconciliations can't help but feel hollow in the face of the game's prior violences.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, it's hard to hold its deflating final ending, unlocked after a minimum of three complete runs, too much against Silent Hill f. Few games can claim to have any moments of such startling, unsettling power. Fewer still elaborate on those moments with intelligence and complexity. Silent Hill f does both and much more besides. It matters how much a game makes you feel. Each time Hinako bowed her head to harm, I felt such terror, revulsion, and aching, aching sadness. The feeling will stay with me long after the details of Silent Hill f are gone from my memory.</p>

			<p>It's finally time to discover <strong>Wccftech's five best games of 2025</strong>. But first, let's take a moment to look at what happened this year in gaming.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was another year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>heavy layoffs</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>studio closures</strong></a>, as the industry continues to readjust to the post-pandemic world and the challenges of a market entirely saturated with game releases that often steal each other's visibility. The other major topic of the year was the use of AI, which divided opinions within the development community and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culminated in the Larian controversy</a> when the studio admitted to using it during production to expedite certain basic tasks. It's easy to predict that this subject will be discussed more in the coming years, with further controversies likely to arise.</p>



<p>Thankfully, many great new releases brought fun and joy to all those who genuinely love this entertainment medium. When looking closer at the most unanimously acclaimed new titles launched this year, by the way, it's hard not to call 2025 the year of the indie-ish.</p>



<p>Some of the best games released this year were, after all, made by smaller studios with budgets that did not even approach the dozens or even hundreds of millions that the top studios can spend nowadays. Perhaps that's not so unheard of, but the difference is, those games tended to be the so-called 'rough gems', often featuring innovative mechanics but also a lot of 'jank' somewhere in the overall product due to a lack of resources. </p>



<p>This time, though, these games were almost as polished as the best triple-A examples, and often outshone them in innovation and ingenuity. That said, there were also some great AAA releases this year. Without further ado, keep scrolling to read our ten best games of 2025 and vote in the community poll.</p>

<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.5</a>)</h2>



<p>The poster child of the small-team revolution is undoubtedly French developer Sandfall Interactive. With a budget of less than ten million dollars for their debut game, they proved that turn-based JRPGs are absolutely vital and that small developers can punch so far above their weight that they even outshine far bigger, critically acclaimed productions, breaking the existing record for most prizes won at an edition of The Game Awards with 9.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they delivered an amazing, unforgettable game in the hands of fans. Here's Francesco De Meo's summary from the Wccftech review:</p>



<p><em>Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hades-2-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Despite being an independent company of a small size (around 25 employees), Supergiant Games is no stranger to having its games celebrated far and wide. Almost all of its games (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades) received acclaim, and the first Hades even won several game awards. This time, though, they attempted a sequel and absolutely nailed it, as mentioned in David Carcasole's review:</p>



<p><em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/silksong_art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong </h2>



<p>Team Cherry's latest game was also a sequel to a beloved indie title. The Australian team surprised everyone with the original Hollow Knight in 2017, selling over 15 million copies in eight years and garnering acclaim as one of the greatest Metroidvania games ever made. </p>



<p>However, the development of Silksong was quite long. It actually started even before the release of Hollow Knight as a DLC for that game, but then it morphed into a much larger project, and the developers went quiet for a very long time. In 2023, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced another delay</a>, and it wasn't until the latter half of this year that we got the very first details about Silksong, just in advance of its September 4 launch.</p>



<p>In the end, the long wait was absolutely worth it, as Silksong received heaps of praise for the game's artistic vision and its improvements to key systems, including combat, pacing, boss fights, and narrative. Silksong is a challenging game, but it's also fair, which is another feat that's far from easy to accomplish. Thus, it earns its rightful place among the best games of 2025.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a316285a09eceee300a8f0cb007599cf20aa6404a105a05a-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Whereas both Silksong and Hades were sequels to beloved indie games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> came out of nowhere with a brand new IP. Granted, many of the members of AdHoc Studio had previously worked on Telltale's successful releases, but Dispatch was still a big surprise. Who knew that having to ditch a cool mech for a desk job would be so fun?</p>



<p>Seriously, though, the game is incredibly well-made in every regard, from the gorgeous comic-book-inspired art style to the witty dialogues, iconic characters, and engaging story that is as far removed from traditional superhero fare as you could imagine. At its budget price, it is practically a must-buy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios is another team that started small and slowly carved itself a niche for split-screen co-op exclusive games with interesting settings and stories. Their new game, Split Fiction, is every bit as enjoyable as A Way Out and It Takes Two, and even more refined in some areas. Critics and fans alike loved it; the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller in just two days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed four million units sold in two months</a>. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a movie on the way with Sydney Sweeney set to star</a> (in all likelihood, as Zoe Foster). If you have someone else who enjoys playing this type of game, getting it for co-op is a no-brainer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Warhorse Studios was once an independent studio as well. The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance was crowdfunded via Kickstarter, after all, but following that game's successful release, the Czech developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by THQ Nordic</a> (now Plaion). With a much larger budget at their disposal, they were able to create a much bigger, not to mention more refined, open world RPG that fully realizes their original vision. Chris Wray gave it a perfect ten and commented:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yotei (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.8</a>)</h2>



<p>Sucker Punch struck gold with Ghost of Tsushima, 2020's excellent action/adventure game. Their new IP sold exceptionally well, prompting Sony to get John Wick director Chad Stahelski to direct a movie adaptation and, of course, fast-tracking a sequel at the Bellevue-based studio. With Ghost of Yotei, the studio retained the same formula, refined it, and presented it with another great story that every samurai fan won't want to miss. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima has returned this year with the second chapter in the post-apocalyptic adventures of Sam (Norman Reedus), this time set in Australia. The gameplay of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is much more varied than the first 'strand game', and there's also a vastly improved combat system. The presentation is simply unparalleled, and the performances of the whole cast are fantastic. </p>



<p>It may still not be for everyone, but Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is nonetheless undoubtedly worthy of appearing in our best games of 2025 list.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ARC_Raiders_A_KeyArt_Main_01_Horizontal_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>If you told most people a year ago that ARC Raiders would not only be in this list but also one of those with the best chances to win, they would not have believed it. Embark stunned everyone with how refreshing ARC Raiders turned out to be, not to mention incredibly well-balanced between its PvE and PvP elements. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>



<p><em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Out of all the games on this list, Battlefield 6 might have been the most anticipated in terms of sheer fanbase size coming into 2025. The excellent news for Battlefield fans is that their beloved military shooter franchise is back with a new installment that understands what made the best games in the saga so great. The natural outcome was for Battlefield 6 to become the best-selling game of the year, with estimates placing it near the 24 million units sold milestone.</p>



<p>In Wccftech's review, David Carcasole stated:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-digital-foundry-2000655990</link>
            <guid>1394035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve has revealed the official list of best-selling games on Steam for 2025. They include everything you’d expect, plus a few surprises. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> ended up beating out <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and others for a spot in the top dozen, despite being recently labeled as one of the worst PC ports of the year by <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025">full list of the top 24 best-selling new Steam games,</a> broken up into two sections. The games within the sections are in no particular order. First, the top 12:</p> <ul> <li><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></li> <li><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26 </em></li> <li><em>Borderlands 4 </em></li> <li><em>Schedule I </em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII </em></li> <li><em>Battlefield 6 </em></li> <li><em>Dune Awakening </em></li> <li><em>Arc Raiders </em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em></li> </ul> <p>And numbers 13-24:</p> <ul> <li><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li> <li><em>Dispatch </em></li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em></li> <li><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></li> <li><em>Europa Universalis V </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction </em></li> <li><em>Inzoi </em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em></li> <li><em>Stellar Blade </em></li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></li> </ul> <p>The list includes the big blockbusters, but also more hardcore historical strategy games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a> and <em>Europa Universalis V</em>. I was surprised to see <em>Civilization 7</em> in the top 12 despite its launch woes and fan discontent around some of the new features and the content-light end game. But then again, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> secured a top spot as well despite miserable user ratings as fans await still much-needed optimization patches.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s action-RPG also made <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s list of the worst PC ports of 2025. The technical analysts there still seem flummoxed by how badly the game runs, even after its latest Title 4 Update, and even as the publisher’s upcoming work like <em>Pragmata</em> and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appears to be doing just fine on the platform. “Definitely one of the poorest games I’ve reviewed in a long time from a technical performance perspective,” Alex Battaglia said during the outlet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s3_0yhXDKTs">annual look back video</a>.</p>

 <p>Capcom has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">bigger performance improvements in 2026</a>, but even those will be spread out across a couple of months. It’ll be the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ launch and PC players will still be waiting to see if the game will finally be passable on that platform or if it’ll continue to run with framerate hitching and texture pop-in, among other issues.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-digital-foundry-2000655990]]></content:encoded>

			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings.
