		<p>Blades of Fire has been revealed by 505 Games and developer MercurySteam, their upcoming third person action RPG that will be launching surprisingly soon for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 22nd May 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blades of Fire - Official Announcement Trailer | IGN Fan Fest 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFDarIpwXsg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Previously going by the codename <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/01/metroid-dread-creators-are-working-on-a-new-fantasy-rpg/">Project Iron when it was announced back in 2021</a>, the hero of Blades of Fire is pretty much the last person in the world that knows how to smith steel, Aran de Lire, the son of a King’s Ward Commander shaped by a tragic event in his youth and now entrusted with the task of killing the evil queen. He’s accompanied by Adso de Zelk, who will provide a bit of strategy to Aran’s raw power and be on hand to help solve some world puzzles.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of smithing to be expected as you forge new weaponry to go up against a menagerie of enemies that include everything from imposingly armoured warriors, to many-handed freaks, and the more natural and mechanical.</p>
<p>There’s shades of the modern God of War to this, from the closeness of the third person camera, and it will be interesting to see how this has come together.</p>

<p>Spanish developer MercurySteam is best known in recent times for their excellent Metroid Dread, the culmination of over a decade working on a string of Castlevania games for Konami in the early 2010s, before being entrusted with a Metroid II: Samus Returns remake for 3DS.</p>
<p>Sure, Blades of Fire is going to be in a rather different genre, but looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread review</a>, I bestowed the 2D platforming sequel a fantastic 9/10, concluding:</p>
<p>“Metroid Dread sees the galaxy’s best bounty hunter return in fine form. It takes the terror of being hunted from Metroid Fusion, the more modern direction of Samus Returns, and the freedom to add to the series’ decades of lore to create something that’s nigh on essential for Metroid fans.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-driver-572-60-fix-black-screen-rtx-50-gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released a new GeForce Game Ready driver</a> optimized for the latest NARAKA: BLADEPOINT update. The highly popular melee focused free-to-play Battle Royale game by 24 Entertainment now supports NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, allowing players to achieve astounding frame rates on the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>
<p>Leading the pack is the flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090. According to NVIDIA benchmarks, it can run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at an average of nearly 600 frames per second (yes, you've read that right) at 4K resolution and maximum graphics settings with DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode. That's a massive uplift compared to the admittedly still more than sufficient 150 frames per second that the card can achieve without DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The GeForce RTX 5080 achieves only a little more than half the average frame rate of its bigger sibling, 312 frames per second. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is fairly close at 255 average frames per second. At lower resolutions, DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen lets GeForce RTX 50 owners run NARAKA: BLADEPOINT at even more mind-boggling frame rates: 737, 536, and 450 FPS at 1440P and 933, 727, and 642 FPS at 1080P.</p>
<p>The latest game update also optimizes character grappling hook resources to provide a smoother experience when using it. In-game 'loot memory' was also optimized, improving memory recovery after combat to reduce memory consumption. Content-wise, 24 Entertainment added a new hero called Ziping Yin to the Showdown mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgrJieiIZg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA also revealed that the new DLSS 4 plugin for Epic's Unreal Engine 5 is now <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/rtx/dlss?sortBy=developer_learning_library%2Fsort%2Ffeatured%3Adesc%2Ctitle%3Aasc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to game developers, allowing them to access the latest and greatest transformer models for optimal image quality.</p>
<p>As a roundup of the latest PC game releases with integrated DLSS technologies, the racing game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokyo Xtreme Racer</a> is out with support for Frame Generation and Super Resolution, while the roguelite first-person shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287150/Revenge_of_the_Mage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revenge of the Mage</a> launched last month in early access with Super Resolution support.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will debut with DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and ray-traced reflections; on the same day, PGA TOUR 2K25 will be released with DLSS Super Resolution.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-pushes-ahead-with-ai-in-gaming.1120989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft might say its top priority right now is security, but it’s been clear for months that AI is just as important. The odd division out has been Xbox, which hasn’t discussed its use of AI much in public. But that changed last week when Microsoft ripped the band-aid off and waded, somewhat clumsily, into the debate over AI in gaming.</p><p>Last Wednesday, Microsoft revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615048/microsoft-xbox-generative-ai-model-gaming-muse">Muse</a>, its new AI model that can generate gameplay. It was trained on Ninja Theory’s Xbox game <em>Bleeding Edge</em>, and it can understand a 3D world and physics and then respond to players’ interactions. While Muse is a Microsoft Research project at heart, Microsoft presented it in a way that linked it directly to Xbox and the future of the company’s gaming efforts. That has divided opinion between those who argue that Microsoft will use this model to build games and lay off developers, and others who think this is still very early and simply another tool in a game developer’s kit.</p><p>I’ve been speaking to game developers over the past week to get a better understanding of the response to Muse. Of the handful I’ve spoken to, no one is willing to speak on the record for reasons like career concerns and the potential impact speaking out might have on game deals with Xbox. Most echo what <strong>David Goldfarb</strong>, developer and founder of The Outsiders, <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1892273449784967438">posted on X</a> last week, “Fuck this shit.”</p><p>Goldfarb expanded on that brief response in an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xbox-muse-generative-ai-developers-say-nobody-will-want-this/">interview with <em>Wired</em></a>. “When we rely on this stuff we are implicitly empowering a class of people who own these tools and don’t give a fuck about how they reshape our lives,” he said.</p><p>That’s a concern I’ve heard from multiple game developers: if they accept these AI tools then what happens next? There’s a growing fear in the game industry right now that AI will replace human creators, and it’s not a baseless fear, either. Almost half (49 percent) of 3,000 respondents to a Game Developers Conference (GDC) 2024 <a href="https://images.reg.techweb.com/Web/UBMTechweb/%7B4fe03be1-d6b1-4f91-95f4-b4bdea9e739e%7D_GDC24-SOTI-Report_Final.pdf">survey</a> said that generative AI tools are currently being used in their workplace, with 31 percent saying they personally use them. In an industry that’s already struggling with costs and layoffs, the anxiety over AI replacing jobs is high.</p><p>Some developers are hoping that models like Muse will be limited to the early stages of game development, where you could use an AI model to create some rough gameplay instead of sketching out ideas and concepts. Given how nascent Muse is, that seems like a reasonable assumption right now, but as models get more capable over time, where do the lines blur?</p><p>Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> described Muse as a “massive moment of wow” in a recent <a href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/satya-nadella">podcast</a>. “We’re going to have a catalog of games soon that we will start using these models, or we’re going to train these models to generate, and then start playing them,” he said.</p><p>Microsoft is getting ready to release at least one AI-generated game on Copilot Labs, the company’s test bed for AI that requires a monthly $20 subscription to Copilot Pro. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s AI research work tell me the company has also been experimenting with several minigames that are best described as AI-infused. The games, developed by Microsoft Research, use generative models and both human writers and reviewers to create stories and illustrations. One of the minigames, <em>Rushes</em>, lets players select storylines and make choices that influence the AI-driven narrative.</p><p>I’m not expecting Microsoft to release these minigames, as they’re designed as research projects on how AI models and humans interact in game design, but the company could always highlight them in the future. Microsoft chose to demonstrate its Muse model running in real time during an employee-only town hall earlier this week, instead of these minigames. </p><p>The work between Microsoft Research and Xbox on minigames and models like Muse are just the beginning of Microsoft’s AI in gaming efforts. At GDC next month, Microsoft is planning to highlight more ways it’s using AI in gaming. In one session, <strong>Fatima Kardar</strong>, corporate vice president of gaming AI at Microsoft, <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/the-future-of-gaming-supported-by-ai-how-xbox-is-empowering-players-and-creators-presented-by-microsoft/911783">will discuss</a> “how Xbox is using AI to unlock new opportunities across the Xbox ecosystem for both players and game creators.” Another session <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/ai-innovation-for-game-experiences-from-research-to-prototyping-presented-by-microsoft/911349">will demonstrate</a> how game developers and researchers at Microsoft are experimenting with new AI tools for gaming.</p><p>While many of Microsoft’s AI sessions at GDC will be future-looking, there are a couple from Blizzard that will detail how <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/machine-learning-summit-fitting-armor-assets-in-world-of-warcraft-with-deep-learning/908208">use AI models</a> to automate 3D armor fitting or how developers <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/amplifying-player-voices-with-llms-in-game-development/907458">parse through player feedback</a> using large language models. These show off the potential for AI tools to assist developers rather than replace them, so they’re likely to be far less controversial than an AI model that generates gameplay.</p><p>Microsoft says it’s now leaving it up to its own game studios to decide on how AI is used across their games. “We don’t intend to use this technology for the creation of content,” said Ninja Theory studio head <strong>Dom Matthews</strong>, in a video accompanying Microsoft’s Muse announcement last week. Just days later though, Microsoft-owned Activision was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618822/activision-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ai-generated-content">forced to confirm</a> that <em>Call of Duty </em>uses AI-generated content. The confirmation came months after fans noticed a zombie Santa with six fingers in a loading screen in <em>Black Ops 6</em> over the holidays, alongside weapon decals and player cards that seemed to be AI generated.</p><p>How Microsoft’s other Xbox game studios react to its push for AI in gaming is going to be something to keep an eye on throughout 2025, especially when developers outside of Xbox have <a href="https://gamerant.com/black-myth-wukong-director-criticizes-ai/">loudly criticized</a> AI use in game development, with one indie developer creating a <a href="https://www.polygon-treehouse.com/no-gen-ai-seal">“No Gen AI” seal</a> that developers can use on their game’s store page. There might be growing pushback against AI in gaming from developers and players, but I don’t think it will be long until other Xbox game studios make the decision to use AI tools or AI-generated content. By unveiling Muse last week, Microsoft has made clear it wants its studios to be at the very forefront of AI in gaming, regardless of the pushback.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2><strong>The pad:</strong></h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is testing free Office for Windows apps with ads. </strong>Surprisingly, Microsoft has quietly started allowing some countries to install a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618278/microsoft-office-free-windows-apps-ad-supported-version">free version of Office for Windows that includes ads</a>. Microsoft has confirmed it’s just a test for now, but it’s a pretty big test to overhaul how Office is distributed in certain countries. The ad-supported version of Office includes banners that are permanently visible at the side, as well as 15-second video ads that play every few hours. Given this appears to be largely limited to India, I suspect Microsoft is looking at ways it can tempt people into paying for Office instead of pirating it. Microsoft’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/software/microsoft-tests-show-91-new-pcs-from-india-loaded-with-pirated-software/articleshow/66475487.cms?from=mdr">own tests in 2018</a> showed that 91 percent of new PCs in India came loaded with pirated software.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft launches next-gen Phi AI models</strong>. While we await OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 model, Microsoft made a smaller AI model announcement of its own this week. Phi-4-multimodal and Phi-4-mini are <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/aiplatformblog/introducing-phi-4-microsoft%E2%80%99s-newest-small-language-model-specializing-in-comple/4357090">Microsoft’s latest small language models</a>, and both are now available on Azure AI Foundry and Hugging Face. Both can be used by developers on smartphones, PCs, and cars, and Phi-4-multimodal improves speech recognition, translation, summarization, audio understanding, and image analysis.</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox’s new <em>Fable</em> game is delayed to 2026. </strong>Rumors have been circulating that <em>Fable </em>might not make its 2025 release window, and Microsoft confirmed this week that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">being pushed to 2026</a>. Given how busy 2025 is looking for Xbox games, I’m not surprised <em>Fable</em> has been given more time here. The question now is whether Microsoft is still targeting a 2025 release for <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, like I’d heard last year.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft makes Copilot Voice and Think Deeper free with unlimited use. </strong>Microsoft made OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model free for all Copilot users last month, and now it’s providing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619199/microsoft-copilot-free-unlimited-voice-think-deeper-open-ai-o1-reasoning-model-ai">unlimited use of this model and Copilot’s voice capabilities</a> to everyone this week. I think we’re going to see a lot more Copilot announcements in the coming months, and I’ve heard multiple times from sources recently that Microsoft is very focused on increasing AI usage by reducing the barriers to entry and the costs involved.</span></li><li><span><strong>You’ll need more Microsoft Rewards points to pay for Game Pass soon</strong>. Microsoft is bumping the amount of points it takes to get Game Pass through its Rewards program. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/02/microsoft-rewards-appears-to-be-increasing-its-prices-for-xbox-game-pass">It now costs</a> level two members 17,000 (previously 12,000) points for a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, with PC Game Pass jumping to 10,500 points (previously, 7,500).</span></li><li><span><strong>Scientists question Microsoft’s claims of a quantum computing breakthrough</strong>. Microsoft was quick to claim it had reached a milestone breakthrough in quantum computing last week, unveiling its Majorana 1 chip. Now, the physics community <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/617792/microsofts-quantum-quandary">has a lot of questions</a> about Microsoft’s paper, which the company is promising to address at the APS meeting in March.</span></li><li><span><strong>Indiana Jones now has DLSS 4 support</strong>. Bethesda updated <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> with DLSS 4, Multi Frame Generation, and even FSR 3.1 Frame Gen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616975/indiana-jones-dlss-4-fsr-frame-gen-support">support last week</a>. That’s great news for PC players, and we’re now waiting to hear if <em>Indiana Jones </em>is going to make Microsoft’s target of an April release on PS5.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft completes EU sovereign cloud project</strong>. Microsoft has finalized its multiyear project to allow its European commercial and public sector customers to store and process their data within European Union countries. “This milestone is the culmination of a massive, multiyear engineering effort across hundreds of Microsoft product teams and thousands of developers around the globe,” <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/26/microsoft-completes-landmark-eu-data-boundary-offering-enhanced-data-residency-and-transparency/">says Microsoft</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft pauses the rollout of its redesigned Windows 11 battery indicator</strong>. Microsoft started rolling out an improved battery indicator to Windows 11 PCs last week, hitting the Release Preview ring before a broader rollout. Just days later, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/02/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3321-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Microsoft paused it</a> “to address some issues.” It’s not clear exactly what those issues are, but Microsoft says it plans to “begin rolling it out in a future update soon.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft has reportedly dropped some AI data center leases</strong>. Microsoft has committed to spending $80 billion this fiscal year on AI data centers, but there are signs it might be wavering on that commitment. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-24/microsoft-cancels-leases-for-ai-data-centers-analyst-says"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a> that US brokerage TD Cowen warned that Microsoft has pulled back on some leases for US data center capacity. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report directly, and one analyst has suggested this could be just “business as usual” with Microsoft free to “move in and out of data center leases, many of which were never officially signed.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft calls on the Trump administration to ‘avoid a strategic misstep in the AI global race.’ </strong>Microsoft vice chair and president Brad Smith has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/27/trump-administration-ai-global-race/">penned an open letter</a> to the Trump administration, asking it to change the Biden administration’s interim AI diffusion rule that caps the export of US AI components. Smith argues that the rule will “give China a strategic advantage” in the AI race, and could prevent US allies and partners from accessing AI infrastructure and services from Microsoft and other US tech companies.</span></li></ul></div><p>What do you think about Microsoft’s big push for AI in gaming?

            <p>EA have restored and released the full source code for several antique Command &amp; Conquer games under the GPL license, in a red letter day for series modders. The games in question are the original Command &amp; Conquer (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-red-alert">Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert</a>, Command &amp; Conquer Renegade and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-generals">Command &amp; Conquer Generals</a>, plus the latter's Zero Hour expansion. That's a lot of refurbishable strategy game to get your head around.</p><!--more-->
<p>All this is reportedly the result of EA commissioning one particular modder, community figure Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, to restore the old C&amp;C source codes, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandandconquer/comments/1izmml4/cc_steam_workshop_support_source_code/">described at fearful length on Reddit</a>. If you're not familiar with him, he was involved in bringing the C&amp;C Ultimate Collection to Steam back in March 2024. RPS Tank Driver-For-Hire Steve Hogarty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/command-conquer-remastered-collection-review">called that</a> "the treatment these genre-defining games deserve".</p>
<p>You can find the source code for Tiberian Dawn <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Tiberian_Dawn">on this Github page</a>. The Red Alert code is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Red_Alert">over here</a>, while Renegade is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Renegade">here</a>, and Generals/Zero Hour is <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour">thisaway</a>.</p>
<p>They're also throwing custom mapmakers a bag of bones by adding Steam Workshop support for Renegade, Generals, and Zero Hour, together with Command &amp; Conquer Tiberium Wars, Kane's Wrath, Red Alert 3 - plus the Uprising expansion - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/command-conquer-4">Command &amp; Conquer 4</a> Tiberian Twilight. All of the mission editor and world builder tools for these games have been updated so you can publish maps directly to the Workshop.</p>

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> finally so close you can almost smell it (sweat, damp cat, and a lingering whiff of dung bomb, would be my guess), Capcom has teased more of what's coming in its first post-launch content update, now confirmed to be launching in "early April".
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Capcom has discussed Monster Hunter Wilds' Title Update 1, of course; earlier this month, it revealed everyone's favourite bubble dragon Mizutsune would be the first post-launch monster joining Wilds. But now, on the eve of the game's release, it's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236">additionally teased a "new level of challenge"</a>, that'll manifest as a monster of "formidable strength" somewhere above the tougher Tempered variants currently found in-game.
</p>
<p>
Its announcement also alluded to "another challenging monster", but it's unclear if this is a reference to Mizutsune or a third new monster. Either way - as I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">noted in my review this week</a> - Wilds' difficulty feels like it skews a little low at the moment, even where Tempered monsters are involved, so it'll be nice get something a little tougher to tackle so early into its lifespan.

<p>
And there's more. Capcom has <em>also</em> teased a "new place to gather" for hunters who've completed the main story, providing somewhere for friends to "meet, communicate, have meals together, and more". And by more, I assume it means arm wrestle. Currently, Wilds doesn't have a centralised gathering hub in the same way previous Monster Hunters games did, so the addition should create a welcome social focal point for players. And hopefully we'll get some seasonal decor to admire once the post-launch quests start rolling in.
</p>
<p>
But before Title Update 1's "early April" release, Monster Hunter Wilds is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-monster-hunter-wilds-physical-release-requires-a-day-one-update-but-digital-buyers-can-get-a-head-start">set to receive a 15GB day one update</a> - although Capcom hasn't yet detailed what it'll include. Hopefully, it'll address the technical rough spots evident in the pre-launch version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-feels-undercooked-on-ps5-series-x-and-especially-series-s">Digital Foundry called "undercooked" on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-plays-better-on-ps5-pro">the PS5 Pro version fares better</a>.

TU1 will bring with it a monster of formidable strength at a level above Tempered!” Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> on Thursday. <br>“Another challenging monster will also await you!” The leviathan Mizutsune was previously teased as one of the first post-launch beats coming to the game. The publisher also confirmed a social hub for players to meet, communicate, and eat with one another will be added in April and available to players who have completed the game’s main story.</p><p>That’s welcome news considering that there’s currently no place to hang out with other hunters and show off cool armor and gear. The news of stronger bosses on the way is also great, considering <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </em>main story can be a cake walk and even some of the post-game content doesn’t feel too difficult if you’re correctly prepared or rolling with a full squad of other players (or AI-controlled NPCs). </p><p>A number of early reviews of the game dinged it for how streamlined it feels compared to past entries in the action-RPG series, with some critics and longtime fans especially concerned about the lack of really challenging content even in high-rank missions. That said, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">as I wrote in my review earlier this week</a></span>, I’ve still been having a blast with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and there’s clearly plenty of room for more challenging content to arrive in the future. Plus series veterans have been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same difficulty debate plenty of times before</a></span>. </p><p>I’m still cleaning up the last of the side quests in the base game and have found myself occasionally getting demolished by a particularly challenging foe like a Tempered Jin Dahaad (it was also late at night and I was starting to fall asleep, which might have been a part of it). And even when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t making me sweat, every moment has still been a joy. </p><p>It’s a pretty frictionless experience so far, yes, but also still an incredibly robust, refined, and meaty version of the <em>Monster Hunter </em>experience. It’s easy to see it only getting better with time. A month after launch for the first new bosses might be a long wait for some, but it gives the average player plenty of time to get through everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently has to show them, which is a lot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Streaming platform Twitch has announced a big change to its monetization policy, as "most streamers" will soon gain access to the site's monetization tools. Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners could access these revenue-generating tool, but these will be available to more creators later in 2025.</p><p>"We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you're just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while," Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We're excited to open up monetization tools--subscriptions and bits--to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage. We're also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch."</p><p>Previously, earning a Twitch partnership required a user to have 50 followers, an average of three viewers per stream, and at least eight hours of cumulative streaming across at least seven different days. That process could be daunting for new streamers given the competitive nature of Twitch, but it was generally achievable if a person was consistent with their efforts.</p><p>Beyond this big change, Clancy also explained other plans for Twitch in 2025. The company is working on features to help partners earn more money while collaborating, both landscape and vertical video through enhanced broadcasting tools will be added to improve the mobile viewing experience, and the tools to edit clips will also be improved. These updates come shortly after <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1892277199497043994" rel="nofollow ">Twitch announced that it'll be implementing a 100-hour storage cap</a> on highlights and uploads starting April 19, a move that has not gone over well with a large part of its userbase.</p><p>While the company cites a need to save on storage costs and video highlights not being as popular as it envisioned as reasons behind the move, users have noted that Twitch's parent company Amazon is one of the biggest names in cloud storage, leading to criticism of the cost-cutting measure.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the biggest sports game ever in the US according to Circana, and it seems that the publisher is considering bringing back its take on college basketball, which has been dormant for more than a decade. In a recent report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports senior vice president Daryl Holt said that college basketball (and other sports) remain a possibility, but reiterated that American football is still the publisher's main priority.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a clear need, want, desire from our community and the faithful were there [for college football]," Holt said. “As developers, we try to figure out how we can get creative on reaching other aspects of sports, whether that be a smaller sport or one that doesn't have a game. But right now, my focus has been on American football. We'll keep looking for those things, but as a developer and working in sports, you're always tapping your head going, what else could be possible?”</p><p dir="ltr">The last EA Sports-published NCAA basketball game, NCAA Basketball 10, came out in 2009 and featured the now-retired dunk contest champ Blake Griffin as the cover athlete. While any plans for a new college basketball game remain quite nascent, it's likely that EA would try to get as many student athletes as possible to sign to a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal. More than 11,000 FBS football players opted into CFB 25's deal last year, receiving $600 and a copy of the game as compensation for their NIL rights. The NIL deal for CFB 26 is reportedly still being negotiated, though EA declined to comment on those plans. The CFB series itself lay dormant for more than a decade, the last release coming in 2012 before last year's revival restored its fortunes.</p><p dir="ltr">Holt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-new-college-football-26-features/1100-6529751/">teased new features</a> coming to this year's sequel, CFB 26, including possible improvements to the single-player career mode Road to Glory. CFB 25 was the second-best selling game of 2024 in the US, second only to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/psvr-2-gets-a-big-permanent-price-cut/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced a big price cut for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2</a>, dropping the recommended retail price of the of the VR headset starting in March.</p>
<p>The same two SKUs for PSVR 2 will still be on offer – a base edition that includes the PSVR 2 headset, PSVR 2 Sense controllers and some earbuds, and a Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle that adds a digital download code for the game – and they will now have the exact same price.</p>


<p>The new RRP for PSVR will be $399.99 (pre-tax) / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>
<p>That’s a pretty significant drop of $150 / €150 / £130 for the standard set, and $200 / €200 / £170 for the game bundle – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/psvr-2-price-cut-by-a-whopping-200-180-for-a-limited-time/">this matches the promotions from last summer</a>, as they were gearing up for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/15/psvr-2-pc-adapter-review-is-sonys-headset-now-the-go-to-for-pc-vr/">the release of the PSVR 2 PC adapter</a>.</p>
<p>This is perhaps indicative of where PSVR 2 is as a product. PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch have all gone without any price cuts since the start of this generation. In fact, they’ve actually become more expensive over time, even when shrunken down, simplified versions of these consoles have launched,<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/"> like with the PS5 Slim</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the PSVR 2 PC adapter last year, dropping the price permanently could spur on some sales, with speculation and insider whispers that Sony has struggled to shift the hardware – there’s also been rumours that Apple might like to co-opt the Sense controllers for Apple Vision Pro compatibility, though these are not sold separately and any plans have yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Sony has noted that recent updates for PSVR 2 have added low-latency hand tracking, which lets you put the controllers down and play using your hands and fingers, the PSVR 2 headset mapping out their positions using the tracking cameras ordinarily used for following the Sense controllers. This is supported with the recently updated Waltz of the Wizard:</p>
<p><iframe title="Waltz of the Wizard - Hand Tracking Update Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXtR7_4IdaU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All in all, this could make PSVR 2 a shade more appealing – it not longer quite costs more than a PS5 (with disc drive), for example – and the PC VR support is excellent, opening up broader access to VR gaming and with the reassuring longevity that PC gaming provides.</p>

		<p>Independent developer 4A Games Ukraine has rebranded as Reburn and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/la-quimera-is-a-new-sci-fi-shooter-from-the-metro-devs-and-nicolas-winding-refn/">announced their new sci-fi IP La Quimera</a>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why they’ve done this, and how, when 4A Games and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro">Metro</a> series are both owned by Embracer Group. Well, it’s because what has generally been referred to as 4A Games is actually two companies: 4A Games Malta which is owned by Embracer, and 4A Games Ukraine (now Reburn), which is independent.</p>


<p>It makes absolute sense that, now that they are launching a new IP, Reburn needs to stake out a new identity for itself.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s plenty of scope for confusion here, and there is still some fuzzy grey areas in the understanding of the timelines and the financial transactions that took place over the past decade. We’ll seek to clear this up through this article.</p>

<p>In essence, 4A Games was founded in 2006 by a core group of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker">STALKER</a> developers striking out from GSC Game Worlds. In 2014, with the first wave of the Russian-backed uprisings in Eastern Ukraine and Russian annexation of Crimea, some of the team, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/4a-games-opens-new-malta-studio">including creative director and co-founder Andrew Prokhorov and CTO Oles Shyshkovtsov</a>, left the country and set up a new studio in Malta – 4A Games Malta. Both studios could use the 4A Games trademark, share the 4A Engine, and develop <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">Metro Exodus</a> together. In public statements, the Malta studio was referred to as the headquarters for 4A Games, with the Kyiv studio</p>
<p>Where things get muddled is in August 2020. At that time, Embracer (who already held the Metro IP via Koch Media) acquired “4A Games”, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games/">announcing in the press release</a> that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> would be the new parent company for the 150+ members “across two studios in Malta and Ukraine”. Despite the last two years of instability for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/embracer">Embracer</a>, “4A Games” and the Metro IP are still held by the company.</p>
<p>However, the timeline according to Reburn is that Embracer only acquired 4A Games Malta in 2020. Separately in the same year, 4A Games Ukraine received additional investment and started work on their new IP La Quimera. At a later date, and to prevent future confusion, they have decided to leave the 4A Games trademark with the Malta-based studio and rebrand as Reburn.</p>
<p>It’s a quietly remarkable story for how unremarkable it actually is, outside of scratching our heads how Embracer didn’t actually acquire the Ukraine studio. There’s no big wave of layoffs, no exodus of developers, and both studios can proudly share their legacy of working on the Metro series. This is perhaps conceptually similar to how Arkane Lyon and Arkane Austin created <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/10/08/dishonored-review-ps3-xbox-360/">Dishonored</a> together and then started working on separate projects.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, both Reburn and 4A Games will be able to use the 4A Engine. While Reburn has now announced La Quimera, 4A Malta’s next game is still under wraps – the most recent game in the Metro series was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro: Awakening VR</a>, developed and self-published by Vertigo Games, and we know that a new Metro is in the works.</p>

The hail from all different genres and teams, and range from very good to absolutely terrible. Steam is normally a mess to browse, and Next Fest is the usual discoverability labyrinth on steroids. So we’ve been playing stuff to see what has that special spark. Here are some of the games we’ve been enjoying and mesmerized by from Steam’s latest free demo bonanza. </p></div><div><p>Kathy Rain is finally back, eight years after her last, fantastic adventure. She’s now working full-time as a PI, but it’s not going well, money is about to run out, and she’s betting everything on solving a series of local murders by a serial killer called The Soothsayer. The demo gives a good chunk of game, and some excellent puzzles. — John Walker </p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>If you thought Steamboat Willie’s entering the public domain was just going to secure you a few terrible horror movies, think again. It’s also going to score one of the most astonishingly disturbing games I’ve ever played. And I’m pretty sure it’s good? <em>Bad Cheese</em>’s demo is a monstrously upsetting first-person...something, in which you play a bloated, morbidly obese Mickey Mouse, desperately trying to find pills for his mutant dog-like father-creature. Oh god, even the sound effects make me curl up to remember. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>This twin-stick shooter does more interesting things in its demo than so many games offer in their entirety. It’s a game where your health bars are also your ammo, so attacking makes you vulnerable, and that’s a damned fine idea alone. Then it gets more complicated. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>Bad Cheese</em> isn’t the only disturbing black-and-white demo we’ve found this Next Fest. <em>Kiddo</em> is a monochrome point-and-click adventure in which you play a masked figure who lives in disgusting solitude, finally spurred to leave his couch by the disappearance of his dog. In the demo, you’re mostly focused on trying to clean the toilet. And it’s <em>so</em> good. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>Race around collecting golden gears and other stuff in a beautiful seaside world where you surf around with the flare and ease of an animated ‘90s cereal mascot. <em>Demon Tides</em> is a follow-up to<em> Demon Turf: Neon Splash</em>. There are only about five short levels in the demo so it’s only a taste, but I already want more. I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, I mean <em>Demon Tides</em>.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p>Set in Quito, Ecuador in 2001, <em>Despelote</em> is an urban walking sim where you learn about a neighborhood and its residents by kicking a soccer ball around. Its collage art-style is evocative, the music is beautiful, and the dream-like exploration of someone else’s mundane memories is affecting and hard to shake. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>May 1, 2025</p></div><div><p>Colorful, fast-paced parkour in a whimsical world that’s constantly falling apart around you. That’s <em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> in a nutshell, a very neat action platformer that can feel like a mashup of <em>Sonic</em> and a Studio Ghibli movie. I love it. One YouTube comment put it best. “They <em>actually</em> made the ‘Awesome Parkour Guy You Watched Out The Back Seat Car Window When You Were a Kid’ game.” — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD</p></div><div><p><em>Mashina </em>is a stop-motion strategy sim where you play a robot digging through the earth to harvest resources and repair the world around you using machines. Think stripped-down elements of <em>Minecraft</em> and<em> Factorio</em> wrapped around a cute, child-like adventure. The demo is super short and gave me <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> vibes (complimentary), and the mixed-media visual style is top-notch.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p><em>Is This Seat Taken</em> is the perfect kind of puzzle game. It has a simple setup—sort out differently-shaped people correctly—and so excellently and confidently nails that premise that playing it feels like someone injecting dopamine directly into your brain. I burned through the demo so fast that I was sad I have to now wait to play the full game. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>XCOM </em>creator Julian Gollop isn’t what you might expect. <em>Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> is a third-person shooter tower defense strategy game that features colorful visuals and large open maps to explore. It’s like someone mixed together<em> Ratchet and Clank</em> with <em>Orcs Must Die</em> and added a tactical vision mode, too. Sounds a bit odd, but it’s really fun and feels great even in this unfinished state. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> is pitched as a turn-based beat’em up and while that sounded strange, after playing the new demo, I’m totally in. This new <em>TMNT </em>game is turn-based, sure, but moves fast thanks to the fact that every few turns part of the map falls away. So you are forced to keep moving through crowds of enemies and use each turtle’s unique abilities to fight while picking up pizza for health. It’s a little harder than I expected, but I think this is something special. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Building on the foundation you laid in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/civilization-7/Antiquity_Age">Antiquity age</a>, this is your chance to get ahead and start looking at opportunities to set yourself up for eventual victory in the Modern age. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, your choice of Exploration age civ is going to be extremely impactful. There are eleven Exploration age civs in the game, all with different traits and strengths. You may not have access to all of them every game, as they each have specific unlock requirements, but no matter how many options you're dealing with, our Civ 7 Exploration civs tier list can help you make that crucial decision.</p><div id="best-civ-7-exploration-civs" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3><h3>Best Civ 7 Exploration Civs</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Civ 7 Exploration Civs Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-tier</strong> - Mongolia, Shawnee, Norman</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-tier</strong> - Chola, Ming</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>B-tier</strong> - Abbassid, Hawai’i, Inca, Songhai</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>C-tier</strong> - Majapahit, Spain</p><h2 data-cy="title2">S-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the best of the best Civilization 7 has to offer. Whether it's their particularly strong military units, or their very powerful resource access, you can largely dominate maps with these choices. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-mongolia-1740591019889.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Mongolia</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Bokh</strong> - When you capture an opposing Settlement gain the strongest Cavalry Unit you can train, but -50% Production towards training Settlers. Gain 1 Point towards training Settlers. Gain 1 Point towards the Non Sufficit Orbis Legacy Path for controlled. Settlements in the Distant Lands and conquered Settlements in the Homelands. +30% Production towards constructing Erdene Zuu.</li><li><strong>Keshig</strong> - Mongolian Unique Ranged Unit.

Restores movement to any Mongol Unit at its location. Mongolian Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse Bonuses on a tile. Cannot be placed on Rough, River, or a tile with a Feature.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Mongolia is the perfect continuation of the Persia civilization’s ideals from the Antiquity Age - namely, bash your head against other civilizations aggressively to take their land. There’s nothing here that’s flashy, but as a show of brute strength, you will become the bully of a map when taking control of Mongolia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One interesting thing about Mongolia is that it directly feeds into the Military Legacy Path by providing boosts for the Non Sufficit Orbis path. The more you take as well, the stronger your army grows with Cavalry, so you can snowball maps pretty hard, especially with the Keshig and Noyan adding extra firepower. If you are planning to go for a Military victory, Mongolia is a direct path to get there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-shawnee-1740591086661.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Shawnee</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Nepekifaki - </strong>Settlements built adjacent to Navigable Rivers gain +2 Food on River Terrain, but Cities not built adjacent to a Navigable River receive -10% Food. +30% Production towards constructing Serpent Mound.</li><li><strong>Kispoko Nena’to - </strong>Shawnee Unique Infantry Unit. +1 Combat Strength for every unique Empire Resource.</li><li><strong>Hoceepkileni - </strong>Shawnee Unique Missionary. +1 Movement and Rivers do not end movement.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Shawnee unique trait of Nepekifaki is easy to keep active, as most Settlements will likely end up being built around rivers. By doing so, you will get a nice boost of Food, helping your population grow, and allowing you to grab even more land. You have to avoid having cities not on Navigable Rivers, but even in cases where you have a Town not on one, you can just leave it as a Town. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the Kispoko Nena’to could become one of the strongest Infantry in the game under the right circumstances. If you get your hands on multiple Unique Resources, they will become very, very strong. This makes Shawnee a military force to be reckoned with, but also one that will be expanding its borders through population growth too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-norman-1740591108659.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">S-Tier: Norman</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Normannitas</strong> - Land Units receive +1 Movement when Embarked and Land Units adjacent to Coast receive +5 Combat Strength. +30% Production towards constructing the White Tower.</li><li><strong>Chevaler </strong>- Norman Unique Cavalry Unit. +3 Combat Strength against slower Units. Ignores Zone of Control</li><li><strong>Sokeman</strong> - Norman Unique Settler. Civilian Unit capable of founding new Towns. Receive Medieval Walls in the City Center when a new Town is created.</li><li><strong>Donjon</strong> - Norman Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Bailey and Motte in the same District. Receive a free Chevaler Unit when completed.</li><li><strong>Bailey</strong> - +4 Culture. +1 Culture Adjacency for Medieval Walls and Wonders. Norman Unique Culture Building and Fortification. Ageless. All Fortified Districts must be conquered to capture a Settlement.</li><li><strong>Motte</strong> - +4 Happiness. +4 Happiness if placed on Rough Terrain. Happiness adjacency for Wonders. Norman Unique Happiness Building and Fortification. Ageless. All Fortified Districts must be conquered to capture a Settlement.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Normans are a great option for almost anyone in the Exploration Age as they provide buffs that feed into most of the age's Legacy objectives. Land Units receiving +1 movement when embarked is going to be super useful when trying to get a foothold in Distant Lands. Not only will you be able to get Settlers over faster, but you can move your Military Units quicker so you won’t be defenseless after you arrive. This makes them very nimble during this Age, which is surprisingly valuable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are also supported by a very good Cavalry Unit in the Chevaler, which will be strong against armies that rely heavily on Infantry units. By just creating the Unique District, the Donjon, you’ll get free one of those units, making the Normans a military force to be feared. On top of this, the Sokeman Army Commander gives new Towns automatic City walls, which feed into both the power of the Bailey and Motte. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">A-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-chola-1740591143557.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Chola</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Samayam</strong> - +1 Trade Route from the Improve Trade Relations Action. +30 % Production towards constructing the Brihadeeswarar Temple.</li><li><strong>Kalam</strong> - Chola Unique Naval Unit. +1 additional attack per turn if movement allows.</li><li><strong>Ottru</strong> - Chola Unique Naval Commander. Has +1 Movement and greater sight. Opposing Military Units in the Command Radius receive -3 Combat Strength.</li><li><strong>Five Hundred Lords</strong> - Chola Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Anjuvannam and Manigramam in the same District. +5 Land Trade Route range and +15 Naval Trade Route range.</li><li><strong>Manigramam</strong> - +4 Happiness. +1 Gold Adjacency for Coastal Terrain, Navigable Rivers, and Wonders. +50% Production towards Naval Units. Chola Unique Gold and Military Building. Ageless.

Chola Unique Gold and Military Building. Ageless. Must be placed adjacent to Coast.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Exploration Age is where a strong Navy can dominate, and the Chola have access to some serious firepower in this regard. Kalam can attack twice in many instances, while the Ottru debuffs enemy units too. When used in tandem, there’s not many who will be able to withstand a sea-based assault like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Chola also get access to a lot of Trade buffs, increasing the number of Trade Routes they can establish, and also their radius. You should be able to build quite a treasury and maintain decent relations with other civilizations with this. That said, the Chola will struggle to keep up with Science, so pacts will be important to stay relevant. On top of that, they are also not a civilization to pick if you ended up building a very landlocked empire in the Antiquity Age, as access to coasts is fairly essential. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-ming-1740591174599.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">A-Tier: Ming</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Great Canon of Yongle</strong> - +50% Science in the Capital. -15 Science per turn for each Social Policy, but not Tradition, slotted. +30% Production towards constructing the Forbidden City.</li><li><strong>Xunleich</strong> - Ming Unique Infantry Unit. +4 Combat Strength in Featureless tiles. Has a Ranged attack.</li><li><strong>Mandarin </strong>- Ming Unique Merchant. Civilian who can establish a Trade Route to import Resources from a foreign Settlement. +100 Gold when using the Create a Road Action.</li><li><strong>Ming Great Wall</strong> - +5 Culture. +1 Gold Adjacency for Fortification Buildings and Improvements. Ming Unique Improvement. Ageless. Counts as Fortification, +6 Combat Strength when defending. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Can only be built in a line. Cannot branch or fork. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ming civilization has enormous upsides. With some careful management, they can absolutely run away with technological advances in the Exploration Era, as they get a straight 50% buff to all Science in your Capital. However, you can end up hurting yourself. You get -15 Science for every Social Policy, so you will want to lean on Tradition wherever possible. If you manage this, though, the benefits are enormous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ming Great Wall is a versatile building offering great fortification defense, as well as Culture and Gold. The Mandarin is also a great unit for a quick burst of Gold when building Roads, and while not the strongest military unit in the Age, the Xunleichong is a good option if you can station them on featureless terrain. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">B-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In this tier, you'll find good civilizations with a decent amount of benefits. They're generally strong, and may be situationally extremely powerful, but tend to be more specialized. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-abbasid-1740591204160.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Abbassid</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Madina</strong> - Receive 30 Gold for each Rural Population of the City when you create a Specialist. (Scales by Game Speed).+30% Production towards constructing the House of Wisdom.</li><li><strong>Mamluk</strong> - Abbasid Unique Cavalry Unit. When stationed in your territory, receive +1 Combat Strength for each Urban Population in that Settlement. Ignores Zone of Control. Has lower combat strength than other Cavalry units.</li><li><strong>‘Alim</strong> - A Great Person with one charge. Can only be trained in Cities with an Ulema, and the specific ‘Alim receives is random. Each ‘Alim can only be received once. Cost increases per ‘Alim trained.</li><li><strong>Ulema</strong> - Abbasid Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Madrasa and Mosque in the same District. +1 Science to all Specialists in this City.</li><li><strong>Madrasa</strong> - +5 Science. +1 Science Adjacency for Quarters, Science Buildings, and Wonders. Abbasid Unique Science Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Mosque</strong> - +4 Happiness. +1 Culture Adjacency for Happiness Adjacency for Cultural Buildings and Wonders. Unlocks the ability to found a Religion. Abbasid Unique Happiness Buiding. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Abbassid civilization can be excellent, and when used correctly, it offers a variety of benefits. But to get these benefits, you’re going to need to manage your Settlements and properly set them up. You get 30 Gold for each Rural Population of a city whenever you create a specialist. You can also boost Science quite a lot by completing the Ulema District, providing +1 Science for all Specialists in the city. The Mamluk are also decent and can become quite powerful defensively. The Cavalry gains +1 Combat Strength for every Urban population in a Settlement while stationed there.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This civilization is an excellent option if you’re confident in producing and placing Specialists while managing districts. However, if you’re less confident in how these mechanics work, many other, plug-in-and-play civilizations require less finessing. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-hawaii-1740591239769.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Hawai’i</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Moananuiakea</strong> - Gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands to Marine Terrain.+1 Happiness on Fishing Boats. +30% Production towards constructing Hale o Keawe.</li><li><strong>Leiomano</strong> - Hawaiian Unique Infantry Unit. +3 Combat Strength against Infantry and Cavalry Units. Receives Culture from defeating enemy Units.</li><li><strong>Kahuna</strong> - Hawaiian Unique Missionary. Has an action to heal adjacent Units. Receive 25 Gold when you convert a Settlement.</li><li><strong>Lo’i Kalo</strong> - +3 Food and +2 Production. Adjacent Farms receive +1 Culture. Hawaiian Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Grassland or Tropical.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hawai’i civilization is a great choice for those who find themselves by the ocean. Considering the Exploration Age is all about getting in your boats and finding Distant Lands, this can synergise nicely. The Moananuiakea trait means you gain 25 Culture each time a Settlement expands in Marine Terrain. You’ll also get +1 Happiness on Fishing Boats. Neither is an enormous buff, but if you can incorporate a lot of sea into your borders, this will undoubtedly add up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, the Leiomano is a very solid Infantry unit, getting a +3 combat buff against Infantry and Cavalry Units. Considering that’s the majority of land units they will be going up against, it’s just a nice edge that doesn’t require a complex initiation. The Lo’i Kalo is also just a solid producer of Food, Production, and Culture in most cases, making it a versatile building. There’s nothing particularly flashy or hard to use about Hawai’i past just being on a coast, but the civilization has a nice slew of solid benefits that are easy to get consistent value out of. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-inca-1740591264663.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Inca</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Apus</strong> - Can work Mountain Terrain. +2 Food and +1 Production on Mountain Terrain. +30% Production towards constructing Machu Pikchu.</li><li><strong>Warak’q</strong> - Incan Unique Ranged Unit . Has +1 Movement and ignores movement penalties from Rough Terrain. +5 Combat Strength when attacking from Rough Terrain.</li><li><strong>Chasqui</strong> - Incan Unique Scout with +1 Movement. Has increased sight that ignores Mountains and Rough Terrain.</li><li><strong>Terrace Farm</strong> - +6 Food. Incan Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be placed on Rough Terrain adjacent to a Mountain.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Inca civilization is best utilized with a bit of forethought, but if you build correctly, you can do a lot of really good things with them. Choosing this civilization is best if you’ve built your borders with them in mind in the Antiquity Age. This is because their power comes from utilizing mountain tiles. If you built your cities around big ranges though, you will get a lot from the Incas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This civilization lets you work Mountain terrain, and get extra food and production when doing so. On top of that, the Terrace Farm improvement is just a significant +6 to Food, meaning you will be able to expand your borders even faster. The Chasqui scout is also great for exploring Distant Lands, getting extra movement, and ignoring mountains and rough terrain, allowing you to chart new continents really fast. That all said, if you don’t have a lot of mountains within your lands, you’re going to be missing out on a lot of value, making them quite situational. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-songhai-1740591293254.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">B-Tier: Songhai</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Tarikh al-Sudan</strong> - +2 Resource Capacity in Cities on Navigable Rivers and your Trade Ships cannot be Plundered on Navigable Rivers. +30% Production towards constructing the Tomb of Askia.</li><li><strong>Gold Bangles Infantry</strong> - Songhai Unique Infantry Unit. +5 Combat Strength on Resource tiles. +100% Gold from pillaging Trade Routes.</li><li><strong>Tajio</strong> - Songhai Unique Merchant. Civilian who can establish a Trade Route to import Resources from a foreign Settlement. When you create a Trade Route receive 100 Gold if this is a Trade Route with at least 1 Navigable River.</li><li><strong>Caravanserai</strong> - +5 Gold. +1 Resource Adjacency for Navigable Rivers and Resources. Songhai Unique Improvement. Ageless. Does not remove Warehouse bonuses on a tile. Must be built on Desert or Plains.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Songhai are all about making money. If you’re looking to make Gold, this Civilization will do it for you - that said, it’s relatively one-dimensional. The Tarikh al-Sudan trait that gives them +2 Resource Capacity in Cities on Navigable Rivers is nice as those slots do come at a premium. Also, the Caravanserai improvement as well as the Tajiro merchant are very good Gold generators. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, there is no real variety here. Other yields like Influence, Happiness, Culture, and Science might struggle. Of course, you can buy these buildings in towns with all your Gold, but expect some difficulty keeping up with everyone else. Also, the Gold Bangles Infantry, which gets +5 combat on Resource tiles, is a decent defensive option if you set up like that specifically, but considering you’re at the whims of the map, and not your Settlement placement, it can be a little awkward to utilise fully.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">C-Tier Exploration Civs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While not bad civilizations, these are often more situational civilizations or civilizations that require a unique playstyle that might be best for more experienced players. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-majapahit-1740591322798.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Majapahit</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Negara</strong> - All Cities except the Capital receive +1 Specialist Limit. After the Exploration Age the Specialists become inactive until you increase the Limit. +30% Production towards constructing Borobudur.</li><li><strong>Cetbang</strong> - Majapahit Unique Naval Unit. +5 Combat Strength against Naval Units. Can pillage within 2 tiles for 1 Movement.</li><li><strong>Pedana</strong> - Mahapahit Unique Scout with +1 Movement. Has increased sight that ignores Mountains and Rough Terrain.</li><li><strong>Pura -</strong> Majapahit Unique Quarter. Created by constructing the Candi Bentar and Meru in the same District. Receive 1 Relic when completed.</li><li><strong>Meru</strong> - +5 Happiness. +1 Happiness Adjecency for Mountains and Wonders. +2 Happiness on Natural Wonders. Majapahit Unique Happiness Building. Ageless.</li><li><strong>Candi Bentar</strong> - +5 Culture. +1 Culture Adjacency for Coastal Terrain, Navigable Rivers, and Wonders. Majapahit Unique Culture Building. Ageless.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The Majapahit are a decent choice if you live in a relatively varied landscape. The Meru provides Happiness on Mountains, Wonders, and even more on Natural Wonders. The Candi Bentar is a great producer of Culture on Coasts, Rivers and Wonders. That said, it can be hard to really incorporate all of that, and even if you build the Pura district by combining both, receiving 1 relic isn’t often going to tip the scales for you. On top of that, the Negara does let you have an extra Specialist, but again, this likely isn’t going to be a massive deciding factor for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Majapahit is not without merit. Altogether, it can be a decent producer of Culture if the circumstances are right, and if you get more Puras it can be a decent source of Relics. The Cetband Navel unit is excellent too, getting +5 combat strength against enemy Naval Units is strong in an Age when a lot of sailing is happening. That said, the Majaphat lack a little cohesiveness, and can be a touch situational, making it tougher to get full value out of them at all times.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/26/civ-7-spain-1740591360664.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">C-Tier: Spain</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Siglo de Oro - </strong>+15% Gold towards converting a Town to a City, or +30% in Distant Lands. +30% Production towards constructing El Escorial.</li><li><strong>Tercio - </strong>Spanish Unique Infantry Unit.

The Tercio is also a good unit against militaries that have gone a little too hard on Cavalry but are outpaced by many other strong military units of other civilizations in this Age. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Patrick is a freelance journalist with over 13 years of experience who loves going deep on games and getting into their systems.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neighbors-suburban-warfare-is-a-sinister-multiplayer-game-with-a-friendly-face<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package. I had a couple of hands-on sessions with it, navigating its team-based homewrecking action, and though its untraditional format will make for some rough first minutes, it was hard not to walk away from the over the top bedlam with a smile.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s maybe no more antithetical setting for Neighbors: Suburban Warfare’s team-versus-team base-building combat romp than the idyllic, prosperity-pilled 1950’s American suburbs. But developer Invisible Walls wanted to make a game that was bright and colorful and would be striking at first glance and approachable to a broad audience. “We also had this idea of the neighborhood feud element from day one,” art director Andreas Bech explained. “And for most of the team, the post-war optimism of the ‘50s and ‘60s resonates with that.” </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Neighbors: Suburban Warfare Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The irony of the collective drive towards the presentation of perfectionism leading to individual households going so mad with power that they would sabotage their peers because they look like they might be doing <em>too</em> well was the bedrock for every iteration of Suburban Warfare. What started off as a game where players would decorate their houses and vandalize their opponents to win top prize at a sort of house pageant turned into a more raucous skirmisher “after it became apparent that [that version of the PvP and PvE] didn't mix,” Invisible Walls CEO David Heldager revealed. “Everyone just wanted to destroy the other’s house.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so their game morphed into the squad-based hybrid shooter and base-builder that I got my hands on for around an hour with the dev team. Our goal was pretty clear: we must infiltrate the enemy abode and destroy its “essential items” like the stove, toilet, and master bed. This is much easier said than done, of course, as there are so many layers of variables and tactics that come into play during each match that chaos is unavoidable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all starts with character selection. Each of the eight available neighbors has their own signature starting items and special abilities, like the Rosie the Riveter-inspired Kim and her throwable pipe wrench that can build a special autonomous oil-spitting turret to defend her home when she’s out pillaging. There were two available neighborhoods (maps) to choose from, each dictating where neutral objectives will be, and each team can choose a specific house layout to use, each floorplan having its own different entrances and essential item locations. This felt like a lot to try to understand up front, but even though there is a county fair's worth of variability in each match, the pursuit of “the perfect competitive combination” is a bit of a fool’s errand. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to be different in that this is the game you play when you’re not playing [something more competitive like] Marvel Rivals,” David said when I asked the team if and how Suburban Warfare could appeal to the types of gamers that prefer a more sweaty PvP experience. “The tone is lighthearted and we designed it for lightheartedness, but we do find people start getting very competitive after like three or four games,” Andreas added. The design consensus among them was to focus on making cool things first, and balancing them second. “We were not experts on PvP and balancing when we started this game,” game director Sebastian Bevensee said, explaining that unfamiliar traps and weapons that will inevitably knock new players out will feel overpowered until they realize that just about everything is that strong on purpose. The goal is to make everything feel impactful so long as you hit with them, and encourage everyone to be a consequential playmaker when the opportunity presents itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After choosing your avatar to commit minor crimes with and agreeing to what kind of house you’re going to defend with your teammates (and where you’ll be defending it from your opponents), it's time to get to the dirty business of targeted vandalization. Your team of up to four must build all manner of tools, traps, and defenses in order to turn away your annoying nosey neighbors while also empowering your team to be even more annoying and nosier. Buying tools or basic fortifications costs money that you earn slowly over time but in lump sums by knocking out enemies. More valuable options become available when you upgrade your workbench with spare resources found at the construction site, located in a neutral point on every map. After buying starter tools - usually the crowbar since it helps destroy objects faster - every round of Suburban Warfare I played started with a full team sprint towards these wayward crates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My team was pretty good at making it out of the ensuing brawls with a couple of resources without taking too many casualties, but the early moments where no one has special gear is where I felt the character selection and team compositions the most. Big bruisers like Chad can hold the front line and distract the enemy long enough for someone else to snatch resources right out from under you. Or sneaky little bastards like this Dennis the Menace x Kevin McCallister hybrid who can avoid the melee completely and instead start attempting to break into your home while you're gone. Neighbor’s individual special abilities remain impactful throughout the match, but ones with definite strengths above and beyond those never feel stronger than those first few minutes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Dennis the Menace x Kevin McCallister hybrid can avoid the melee completely and instead start attempting to break into your home while you're gone.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After taking the resources back we focused on locking down our house, lining the vulnerable parts of our fence with bear traps, repairing damaged doors and windows, and even setting up a small oil rig to turn our passive trickle of money into more of a sprinkler. All the while, both sides were taking turns poking at one another, sneaking to back doors and windows while causing a ruckus on the front lawns by either running up personally and trying to catch a poor homemaker slipping, or ordering more bombastic offensives on the enemy in the form of delivery trucks that speed through the cul de sac and lob boxes full of fireworks at your foes. And then, after around four minutes of game time, night fell on our pitched battle. Besides making the battlefield darker, it also signals that the nocturnal guard dog of each house is up and prowling, and it is devastatingly good at hunting down any enemy that steps onto your property and eliminating them with extreme prejudice, until the sun rises and the chaos ensues again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exchanges between squads, be they in the streets or each other’s living rooms, were always tense because the more dangerous weaponry, like a sledgehammer or a pressurized cannon that shoots oranges, can do players in quickly. And yet the hammer is slow and the cannon, one of the few ranged options in the game, is hard to aim and slow to fire and reload. This was all by design. “We are always encouraging people to be more up front and close,” Sebastian explained, pointing out that their focus on keeping the most effective and easy to use offense as close-ranged options forces players to engage with one another instead of trying to take sniper positions or control the field from afar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t constrain their weapon options from walking more on the wild side, though. Many of the options operate as you assume they would, but then there are some tricky takes on household items, like the aforementioned vacuum that can suck enemies into bashing range. You can build a chicken coup and toss their eggs at foes to blind them. With enough investment into your workbench you can get access to my favorite option so far: a seagull that you can fly to bomb enemies like a Call of Duty kill streak reward. The cartoony madness is lots of fun, moment to moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the course of these cycles across the rounds I played, the biggest issue I found was feeling like I wasn’t doing the right thing at the right time. I wasn’t searching for the most efficient ways to spend money and resources so much as feeling like I was actively contributing to the overall goal of compromising the enemy's home to a permanent end. Picking up the basics is easy, but learning how to know when to go all out on the enemy or when to pull back to defend was something that I couldn’t intuit in my brief time with Neighbors. David agreed. “Our main struggle is, ‘How do you explain the meta in a game like this?’” They’ve seen playtesters grow into sharp and knowledgeable players over half a dozen games or so, so it's not impossible to let go of worry and embrace the madness.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure how it will stand up against genre juggernauts, but it will certainly stand out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So is Neighbors: Suburban Warfare the next big party shooter? I’m not sure how it will stand up against genre juggernauts, but it will certainly stand out. Two geezers shaped like Mr Magoo and Evel Knievel exchanging plunger crossbow fire in the street only to get hit by a delivery truck tossing bombs into the front yard is a scenario you aren’t going to find in your current favorite team shooter. And Invisible Walls likes it that way. They don’t want to replace your favorite game, they just want to be the Mad Men-coded funhouse you spend your off time in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m confident that even the most locked in gamer hasn’t played something quite like Neighbors: Suburban Warfare. You can see some influences and similarities to other games - it has the arcadey shooter feel of Team Fortress, the light tactical base building of a survival game, the slapstick physical humor of a Goat Simulator or Just Die Already - all in one anarchic post-WW2 package.

But I’m afraid that I must also recommend my favorite knife in my entire house, a Chinese chef’s knife or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caidao" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caidao</a>. These are often referred to as “Chinese cleavers” in English, although not all Chinese knives are intended for cutting through bones like western cleavers. If you only have one knife for preparing food in your household and not a lot of money, I recommend you pick one up. They’re durable, fairly inexpensive, and versatile enough to cover a huge portion of what you need to do in the kitchen.</p><p>This is probably not news to anyone who grew up in a Chinese household or has studied Chinese cooking. Technically there are multiple kinds of Chinese blades in this form factor that are built for different purposes; some are lighter and meant more for slicing vegetables, while others (such as gudao)<em> </em>are heavier and meant for cutting through bone. I don’t find myself cutting through a lot of bones, but ideally it’s nice to have both around.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pieces of China (Episode 3): Chef Fuchsia Dunlop on the Cleaver, June 11, 2020" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RHFv0NKgBZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Writer Fuchsia Dunlop walks through their experience of learning to use a caidao as a westerner.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I started off with an American-made<a href="https://www.dexterrussellcutlery.com/chinese/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Dexter Russell</a> several years ago, but over time got tipped off to two beloved Chinese brands: CCK or <a href="https://www.chefknivestogo.com/ccksmclstha.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chan Chi Kee</a> out of Hong Kong and Shi Ba Zhi Zuo. CCK is a beloved staple that has unfortunately shot up in price, but can usually be bought for about <a href="https://www.actionsales.com/en/wok-range-general-chinese-cooking-equipment-supplies/hk-kf1812.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$80 to $100</a>,, although if you can get one at a local Chinese grocery store you will probably get a better deal. I’ve had my CCK KF1812 for several years now and love it for most purposes that aren’t blasting through chicken carcasses.

A while back, someone on reddit posted a good comparison of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chefknives/comments/pamafm/a_short_primer_on_%E8%8F%9C%E5%88%80_chinese_kitchen_knives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two brands and their offerings</a> and it’s a solid guide depending on what you find yourself doing more often. It’s also worth mentioning that Wirecutter is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/why-i-use-a-chinese-cleaver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also a fan of many of the brands listed here</a>. Recently Chef Panko, one of the most thorough knives reviewers I know, was shocked by <a href="https://www.chefpanko.com/hezhen-chinese-vegetable-cleaver-knife-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Henzen YM3L</a>. There are tons of Chinese knives out there, usually with either a wood or metal handle, but most will do the job provided they are built for the task.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hezhen Chinese Vegetable Cleaver Knife Review: X9Cr18Mov   YM3L Series" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dGL3uzBljs4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A new budget challenger: the Hezhen YM3L. I haven't tried this one. </figcaption></figure></div><p>What makes a Chinese chef knife such a complete tool is that you can use it for so many tasks in the kitchen: Finely cutting garlic, slicing meat, and cutting thick vegetables. If you know what you’re doing and care for your blade, you basically only need one or two instead of a huge block of knives. The wide, flat blade can be used as a makeshift spatula, making it easy to transfer ingredients. You can also use the flat side to lightly crush garlic, making the skin easy to remove. The dull spine of the blade can be used for tenderizing. I have rarely encountered a tool that was so all-encompassing.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Learn How To Sharpen: Introduction" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zRNT1v0-7s?list=PLsSxXLQSZIe__A5THcrFGto9_PSkXWiN6" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>When I started caring for my knives, I learned the ropes from these now-ancient Korin videos.

Since it was released, it has been a huge success, with the developers saying that it was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">profitable three days</a> after its release, with sales topping 350,000 by that point. Since then, the team has been hard at work on updating the game, adding improvements and fixes to the game, while working on some of the upcoming major updates that would be added.</p>
<p>11 bit studios did initially release a roadmap in November, where it was announced that there would be a free update, as well as console ports in the future. Since then, the studio has released a revised roadmap, which can be seen on Steam. In the roadmap, those interested can get a more accurate timeline as to when the updates and ports will be added to the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>First and foremost, the free major content update will be released on May 8. The text that announces it reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>A day to be remembered: a&nbsp;<strong>Free Major Content Update</strong> that will adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first new Londoners.</em></p>
<p>After the first major update is released for Frostpunk 2, those on consoles can expect to get their hands on the game after waiting just under a year for it. It doesn't have a set release date for console, but the developers have stated that Frostpunk 2 is set to release on console in the Summer. It's set to arrive on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there is no mention of the game being ported to last-gen consoles, including the Nintendo Switch. Whether it will be ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 when that console releases remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Aside from the free content update and the port of the game to consoles, Frostpunk 2 has a major lineup for 2025 at the very least. The Spectrum DLC is set to release in the Fall, and the developers have left the cryptic message with it that it will "help us learn more about ourselves and the people of our great city in more ways than one."</p>
<p>After the Spectrum DLC, the Aurora DLC is also slated to release this year, but depending on how the development and porting goes of the first three major highlights of the roadmap, it may end up pushed into 2026.</p>
<p>Looking into next year, there is a third DLC planned for Frostpunk 2, adding even more content to the game. It's not said yet what is planned for either the Aurora DLC or the third DLC, but more information is bound to be released by 11 bit studios in the future.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month? </em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-a-minecraft-server">Patrick Recommends: A <em>Minecraft</em> Server</h2><figure><figcaption><span>That movie really is going to be terrible, isn't it?</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2022, I said <em>Minecraft</em>, a game released all the way back in 2011, was my second favorite game that year. The reason was my oldest daughter taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>, which led to me taking an interest in <em>Minecraft</em>. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-best-video-games-this-year-helped-me-feel-closer-to-people/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Here's what I wrote:</a></p><p><em>"As kids get older, it becomes harder and harder to connect on the same level as them. My oldest is only six years old, and I can already sense that tension at work. [...] With&nbsp;Minecraft, my daughter and I can play in the same world together, and the power balance shifts completely. She is the one in control, the one with more knowledge than me. She’s the one guiding me from one area to the next, telling me what to do and what to build. She’s the one asking me to find this or that resource, to help build a house she’s working on. When I’m asking her to do homework, I’m a parent. When we’re in&nbsp;Minecraft, we’re peers."</em></p><p>The difference between 2022 and 2025 is that my six-year-old is now eight years old. At the time, my youngest was two years old. Today, she's on the verge of turning five years old. (Life goes <em>fast</em>, man.) <em>Minecraft</em>, to its credit, remains borderline indecipherable. You could tell me the UI is exactly the same way it was in 2011 and I'd believe you, with the major change being lots of new monetization. </p><p>(I know that's not the case, and by all accounts Microsoft's been a good steward. But it's wild how strange and arcane <em>Minecraft</em> remains.)</p><p>But another difference between then and now is that <em>Minecraft</em> has now clicked for my youngest. She can fly around the world. She can build things. She has <em>big ideas</em>. It's lead to family <em>Minecraft</em> nights, as we all sit around on the same world, and also prompted my neighbor to set up a private server, where the kids dip and out during the week, then convene on the weekend to talk about what they built. It's super cool. It's like a playground that exists in and out of time and space.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-harmonies">Cado Recommends: <em>Harmonies</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Harmonies</em> is a board game where you take random sets of wooden tokens and arrange miniature landscapes on a hex grid with the goal of creating specific habitats for animals to live in. It’s quick to learn, has gorgeous components, and yet the random elements make for a devilishly delicious puzzle each time. Every turn you choose a set of three random tiles from a central pool. You can arrange these tiles however you’d like onto your board, with some tiles (like rocks) allowing you to stack them for better points at the end of the game. One rock makes a small hill but three rocks stacked on top of each other makes a large mountain, and that mountain is worth six more points than the hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also take an Animal card during your turn. Animal cards have specific arrangements of tiles on them that, when created, will score you extra points at the end of the game. You score these points by placing a small animal cube on the corresponding tile when you’ve completed the arrangement on the animal card to represent that these animals have moved into that habitat.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the wonderful puzzle of <em>Harmonies </em>is then trying your best to maximize how many animals you can house at once. Once a cube is placed on a tile you can’t place further cubes or stack any more tiles on that space. Those two stacked rocks that make a medium hill are now stuck as a medium hill, but the monkey that moved into that space will hopefully make up the difference in points by the end of the game. At least you hope.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>These monkeys and fish are bad neighbors</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main tension in the game comes from the fact that Animal cards all require you to place the same animal cube <em>multiple</em> times for the most points. The first monkey that moves into my hill by the river only gets me five points, but if I do that twice I’m gaining 11 instead. But now, that hill won’t be able to grow into a mountain, and my fish wants to live in a river next to a mountain, not some dinky medium hill!</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beautiful Natural Harmony</span></figcaption></figure><p>The beautiful moments come when you find two animals that love to be neighbors. These sting rays want to live in a river next to two small hills...but they only lock the river in. You can build their habitat and <em>then </em>continue to stack rocks to attract those monkeys later! It’s in finding these small harmonies (<em>haha</em>) between different animals where the game really sings, that “hell yes” moment of realizing a perfect turn of tiles and animal cards that scratch my brain’s puzzle solving centers just so. The wooden habitat tiles add that extra tactile “oomph” that a good board game needs, and the whimsical illustrations on the animal cards make each draw of the animal pile a new visual delight.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Image courtesy of Libellud Studios</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>It's really a perfect storm for a game this simple, and one of the reasons I picked it up after playing it just twice at a local board game meetup. The fact that it also allows for a solo game that is just as engaging as the multiplayer mode means that I can easily play a game in 15 minutes on my own and feel satisfied with my time. </p><p>Who wouldn't want to make a home for these adorable animals to live in? Have you <em>seen</em> those ducks? Delightful.</p>
