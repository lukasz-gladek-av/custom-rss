<figure data-uuid="c2c025ed95807"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c2c025ed95807/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The rising demand for RAM for AI data centres and the associated rising costs are having a massive effect across the tech world, and with Sony reportedly pushing back the launch of its as-yet-unannounced PS5 successor, Nintendo is considering raising the price of Switch 2 in 2026, too, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis">a new Bloomberg report</a> (paywall).</p>
<p>Speaking to "people familiar with its plans", Bloomberg reports that Sony is now eyeing 2028/29 for its next console hardware, and that Nintendo is looking at how to approach what the article says is being coined "RAMmageddon":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Close rival Nintendo Co., which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said. Sony and Nintendo representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/switch-2-predicted-to-follow-in-playstation-and-xboxs-footsteps-this-year-with-global-price-hike">Niko Partners predicted</a> that Nintendo would be forced to follow suit and raise hardware prices as its competitors have.</p>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was asked about the possibility of a price increase in an interview with <a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945">Kyoto Shimbun</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">back in January</a>, but refused to be drawn on plans at the time, saying "I cannot comment on hypotheticals".</p>
<p>With most tech firms reliant on memory and microchips produced by other companies, this precarious situation around RAM manufacturing has been a concern for some time now, with the crisis growing as AI-invested firms such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google's parent company, Alphabet, purchase DRAM for data centres to drive chatbots and other AI-powered applications. Prices have been driven up at an alarming rate as demand outstrips component availability, with Bloomberg stating that the "cost of one type of DRAM soared 75% from December to January" alone.</p>
<p>Consequently, tech firms must choose between slimmer profit margins or raising prices in an already-fraught economic environment. The Switch 2's launch pricing and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price tag <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/drop-the-price-scream-nintendo-fans-during-nintendos-treehouse-live-broadcast">proved controversial</a> with gamers in June last year, and Nintendo raised the price of all its Switch 1 hardware in the US <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">last summer</a>. Sony and Microsoft both <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/features/xbox-series-xs-how-their-prices-have-changed-over-the-past-five-years">raised their hardware prices recently</a>, with PlayStation getting a $50 hike on all PS5 models in the US <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/ps5-price-increases-confirmed-for-usa-effective-21st-august">last August</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo may have gotten its latest console to market ahead of full-scale "RAMmageddon", but it still has to keep the ball rolling and keep up production numbers. With the tech sector's reliance on RAM for almost everything and the AI bubble yet to burst, one thing is for certain: Switch 2 certainly isn't getting <em>cheaper</em> anytime soon.</p>
<p><em>Are you tempted to push the boat out for a Switch 2 before it gets even more expensive? Happy you jumped in early? Let us know below.</em></p>

              <p>Roger Clark, who plays&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>‘s lead character Arthur Morgan, has a sideline in Cameo messages. The actor recently posted to his X account (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">thanks&nbsp;<em>IGN</em></a>) to talk about an all-time favorite request he’d received, from a man who had just deleted his fiance’s&nbsp;<em>RDR2</em> save game and was looking for any hope of getting out of trouble.</p> <p>“I just deleted by fiance’s saved game in Red Dead Redemption II by accident,” began the anonymous buffoon’s message to Roger Clark. And as if that weren’t bad enough, he underlined the severity of the situation. “She was having so much fun and made every ethical decision, had about 2/3 completed.” Oh dude. There’s surely no coming back from this.</p>

 <p>Although reaching out to Arthur Morgan himself is likely an excellent first step. Posting <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022059161887137920%7Ctwgr%5E9637e6ec535fb2abda3e575092f1fa3e90fd65de%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Flet-us-all-send-this-poor-girl-positive-vibes-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-reveals-cameo-apology-request-from-man-who-deleted-fiances-red-dead-redemption-2-save-file">to his X account</a>, Clark told his followers how much he values their support on his Cameo, thanking them for “liking my shout outs.” He notes that he enjoys them all, but adds “it’s ones like these that I live for.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really am blown away by the support you guys show me on cameo. Thank you for liking my shout outs. I enjoy them all but it’s ones like these below that I live for. Let us all send this poor girl positive vibes. At least her man knows what he did. <a href="https://twitter.com/cameo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cameo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cameo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rdr2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rdr2</a> <a href="https://t.co/U0nHM2pLVT">pic.twitter.com/U0nHM2pLVT</a></p> <p>— Roger Clark (@rclark98) <a href="https://twitter.com/rclark98/status/2022059161887137920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While we can’t see the Cameo itself, for obvious reasons, we do get to see the full text of the request. After explaining the situation, the requester added, “Can you say some words of support for this devastating loss and let her know I am sorry?”</p>

 <p>What a situation to be in. This is dozens of hours of impassioned playing, lost forever, somehow not stored in the cloud. And this is a fiance, remember—it’s not too late for her to walk away without any paperwork. Will a message from the game’s main character be enough, or will that just rub salt in the wound?</p>

 <p>The agonizing thing is, unless the perpetrator reveals himself, we’ll never know how this worked out! Did the message patch things up? Is she some sort of angel who can forgive an enormity of this scale? Please, anonymous person, find your way to Reddit.</p>

Someone modded Goku into <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></a>. And I bet you can’t guess how upset God of War’s creator is at the new 2D <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367"><i>God of War Sons of Sparta</i></a><em>&nbsp;</em>game. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. All the clipped drama that’s fit to print!</p> <p>Let’s remember some games. How about <a href="https://x.com/RagnarSan22/status/2022639748796588448"><em>Radiata Stories</em></a>? Now <em>that </em>was a great game. <a href="https://shmuplations.com/radiatastories/">Here’s an interview</a> with its development team, including its director, Naoki Akiyama, who, as far as I can tell, hasn’t worked on a new game since. It’s one of the only JRPGs that’s ever been brave enough to <a href="https://kotaku.com/revisiting-radiata-stories-my-favorite-video-game-as-a-1819006170">let you kick kids</a>. “Radiata Stories is supposed to feel like these characters are really living this world, and for that, kicking seemed like the perfect interaction,” he said.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Resident Evil</em> game every year until 2030</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/2) RE"10" (though likely won't be called that) is a bit shorter than usual (presuming RE10 doesn't get delayed too, it's right now aiming for a 2029 release date, but could be delayed to 2030, 2031 at worst, up to the whims of game dev), &amp; DLC for RE9 has had time to cook.</p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s what a new leak from <em>RE</em> insider AestheticGamer, formerly known as Dusk Golem, <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2022244942085832763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2022244942085832763%7Ctwgr%5Ef221d152e261de65c9565b722ec4964e84884a3f%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000669435action%3Dedit">is claiming</a>. They suggest the horror franchise’s upcoming roadmap is as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></strong> – February 27</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil Requiem DLC</em></strong> – TBA 2026</li> <li><strong><em>Resident Evil – Code: Veronica Remake</em></strong> – 2027</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil Zero Remake</strong></em> – 2028</li> <li><em><strong>Resident Evil 10</strong></em> – 2029</li> </ul> <p>That is a relentless amount of zombie knifing action. Some fans might think this unverified pipeline rumor sounds too good to be true. I think it sounds like way too much. Hype levels for Resident Evil Requiem are currently off the charts and it’s not just because Leon is back and the previews have all been very solid. It’s also because it’s been five years since the last mainline game, <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, and three years since the last remake, <em>Resident Evil 4</em>.</p>

 <p>In an era of way too many games, four remakes and sequels in four years might look great on an investor sheet but it feels like overkill for a franchise that’s currently at the top of its game. And we all know what happened the last time<em> Resident Evil</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-6-the-kotaku-review-5948171">got overexposed</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> has a new roadmap and it doesn’t include Cardi B skins</h2> <p>After a rough couple of years, Respawn Entertainment’s battle royale is <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap">promising to double-down on rapid improvements</a> and new content, including two new characters joining in 2026. What this roadmap doesn’t include is a bunch of wild crossover skins.</p> <p>“When we’re designing skins, we try to keep in mind the personality of the Legend,” lead Legend designer Brett Marting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/apex-legends/titanfall-legacy-change">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “We haven’t always hit it perfectly, but most of the time we do try to keep that in mind when we’re picking a skin for a character, or a visual to match with them. We like to hit their personality, otherwise it’s going to feel off for the entire immersion of everybody playing the game.”</p>

 <h2>Who needs a <em>Dragon Ball</em> racing game when you’ve got Goku in <em>Sonic CrossWorlds</em>?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn">https://t.co/0nFf5UKLJn</a></p> <p>— Boost ☆ 🇵🇷🐵 (@Boos2fer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Boos2fer/status/2022173524384002530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The Sega go-kart game continues giving <em>Smash Bros.</em> a run for its money with all of the crossover characters getting added, but where licensing deals fail, modders will prevail. Someone recently replaced the Monkey Ball character in the game with Kid Goku riding on his Nimbus cloud and it looks really awesome (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-goku-fan-creation/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>). I hope Bandai Namco is paying attention.</p> <h2>No <em>Spider-Man</em> on Xbox, probably</h2> <p>Fans have been told over and over again that the game will never be ported to Xbox. Insomniac Games responded to the latest wave of speculation as more companies explore multiplatform releases to reiterate that its Spider-Man games coming to Xbox remains “<a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766">unlikely</a>.”</p> <h2><em>God of War</em>‘s creator loses his mind over the new pixel art prequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Jaffe absolutely  rips the new GoW game apart.

Jaffe, never one to flinch when it comes to exploring the full range of the King’s English, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liEszJCMW-k">unloaded on the game in a recent video</a>.</p>

 <p>“Every time you make a new game, you don’t have to go, ‘You know what? Let’s not go back to the great character that people love that built this franchise. Let’s see him as a little kid, some generic boring little fucking kid,'” he said. “It’s just insulting to the fans.

            <p>Some upcoming skins for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> which initially had edgy skull masks appear to have been drastically changed to look a bit more realistic, judging by community findings.</p>
<p>These skins, <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1x4zaBaEKK/?spm_id_from=333.1387.collection.video_card.click">which you can see in their original glory on Bilibili</a>, are a mix between standard military face paints donning stylised combat gear and straight up My Chemical Romance vibe skull masks over military headgear. Those latter skins drawing the ire of a portion of the Battlefield 6 playerbase, especially those who want the game to stay grounded.</p>
<p>"They're all garbage. I just want new playable content, new mechanics and equipment, more vehicle customization, and a customizable class ability system like in BF4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r2slm0/comment/o4z2kj1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote user Kejdurapa on the Battlefield Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>However, luckily for those with a similar taste to the pro-realism Battlefield crowd, additional screenshots released in the following days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/most_of_upcoming_skins_have_changed/">appear to show these same skins toned down in edginess drastically</a>. This either indicates an overhauled version of these same skins, or perhaps an alternative version for those same skins.</p><p>As you can imagine, those previously aggravated Battlefield enjoyers are now very pleased indeed. "That's more like it, not the clown show that was in season 1," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o0ewb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote Ali-S earlier today</a>. Their sentiment was shared by one eaeb4, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1r6727r/comment/o5o1jg0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">who wrote</a>: "This is a big improvement across the board. Some people might like some of the skull mask designs but we don't need it on every other skin.</p>
<p>You may be thinking, who cares, right? A few skins look to have been changed in a live service shooter. Well, it's worth noting that Battlefield 6 was sold to players on the back of its realistic approach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">making direct comparisons to its major competitor Call of Duty and its wackier approach to modern military warfare</a>.</p>
<p>This was true even in pre-release interviews. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield">Lead developers told Eurogamer the game would</a> "stray true to Battlefield" when asked about its approach to cosmetics, indicating a desire to keep things away from the wilder fantasies created elsewhere. These skull masks, as well as some prior DLC released in Battlefield 6, have strained such statements.</p>
<p>Whether things like these skull-faced cosmetics will be buried forever, or if a hint of the absurd will continue to creep into Battlefield 6, is a question for the future. What isn't a question is where the Eurogamer Battlefield 6 review is - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">it's right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last month, developers <strong>RocketWerkz</strong> and <strong>GRIP Studios </strong>announced that the popular survival game, <strong>ICARUS</strong>, would be making its <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-console-edition-arrives-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-in-february-2026/">console debut on February 26, 2026</a><strong>.</strong> Now, less than three weeks after that announcement, the studio has confirmed that ICARUS: Console Edition has been delayed by <strong>one month</strong> and will now arrive on <strong>PS5</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series X/S</strong> consoles on <strong>March 26, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>In a statement sent to Wccftech, the studio says that while the game is "<em>in a strong and stable state</em>," the delay will add enough time for the team to add further polish, "<em>rather than launch with known issues</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>After careful consideration, we've decided to move the release date to Thursday, March 26,</em>" the studio begins in its statement. "<em>This additional month will allow us to polish the gameplay and ensure the best possible launch."</em></p>



<p>"<em>While the game is in a strong and stable state, we've identified a few areas that need further refinement. Rather than launch with known issues, we believe taking these extra weeks is the right decision for the game and players. Our team is fully focused on polishing the experience and game content to ensure it plays as intended across Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. Thank you for sticking with us, we're looking forward to welcoming you to Icarus soon</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the announcement of the delay, RocketWerkz has also revealed that it will host an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurvivalGaming/">AMA session in the r/SurvivalGaming Reddit tomorrow</a>, Tuesday, February 17, beginning at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT</strong>, to give players a chance to ask any and all questions they have about the console edition, the delay, and anything else ICARUS-related.</p>



<p>The upcoming console edition will include the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and if you pre-order the Console Edition, you'll also receive the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>. On top of the base game, this gives those new to ICARUS plenty to dive into when it arrives on consoles next month.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-preview-is-an-emphasis-on-ltms-enough-to-reinvigorate-eas-2025-hit-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1437406</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> launched in October 2025, I couldn't help but be enamoured with it. I have years of memories in previous Battlefield games, and I was happy to see the series return with a very solid military shooter. It was, for the most part, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">exactly what I wanted</a> out of a modern Battlefield game.</p>



<p>I was one of the millions of players jumping into Battlefield 6 constantly during those opening weeks, especially with the arrival of <strong>Season 1</strong>, with three new maps, the new battle royale <strong>REDSEC</strong> mode, and new weapons, gadgets, and vehicles to earn. I was also one of the players who found the stretch between each phase, and the new content that came with it, to be coming at a slower pace than what I would've liked.</p>



<p>Which wouldn't have been too much of an issue if the progression system through the battle pass and unlocking new weapons and accessories wasn't also extremely slow. Thankfully, that's something EA has already been clear <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-looking-ahead-to-season-2">it'll look to address</a> in Season 2, but whether it'll actually be better tuned this time is something we won't know until we're into the full swing of Season 2 when it arrives on <strong>February 17, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>So while I can't talk about most of the retooling that EA and Battlefield Studios have done for Season 2, after spending two hours playing Conquest and Escalation on the new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map, I can talk a bit about what Season 2 has in store.</p>



<p><em><strong>For more on Battlefield 6 Season 2, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reveals-season-2-of-battlefield-6-packed-with-new-maps-weapons-vehicles-and-more/">check out my full breakdown</a> of everything coming from last week's full reveal.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-hands-on-impressions">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Hands-On Impressions</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reiterate, all I got to play from Season 2 was the new Contaminated map. We weren't given the chance to check out the new <strong>Hagental Base</strong> map, the new <strong>Nightfall</strong> mode, or <strong>Operation Augur</strong>, which are all set to arrive later in the season. So these impressions will just be focused on the Contaminated map and some of the weapons arriving in the Extreme Measures phase of Season 2. I specify just the weapons because I unfortunately didn't get a chance to check out Little Bird. Unlucky respawns meant I didn't get a chance to grab it before someone else, and with only a couple of rounds played across the two hours, I was grounded for the whole session. </p>



<p>For what I did get my hands on: starting with the Contaminated map, which honestly felt like a pretty bog-standard Battlefield map. It's got a couple of great interest points that make for good concentrated battles, but unlike my first impressions of Blackwell Fields and Eastwood, I didn't feel there was anything separating Contaminated from the rest of the pack of maps already available in Battlefield 6. It's a slightly different flavour of maps like Mirak Valley, which isn't the worst thing to be, but it also doesn't make for an exciting first new map since November 18, when Eastwood launched.</p>



<p>What's more exciting about the Contaminated map is something that doesn't directly relate to the map at all. The introduction of the <strong>VL-7 </strong>hallucinogenic smoke is probably my favourite new feature added with this new season. It's not a survival layer because the gas itself doesn't do damage to you if you're running in it without a gas mask, but it will make you see things that aren't there almost immediately if you don't have a gas mask on.</p>



<p>It makes for more interesting close-quarters combat and is another gameplay layer that I would welcome on every other map. It's a shame that, at least for now, it only features on Contaminated in multiplayer and on Fort Lyndon in Guantlet. I understand that it's only on those maps for narrative reasons at the moment, but I would love to see it used more liberally and add that layer to other game modes. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Impressions-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>I know some might find it annoying to deal with, but I think the VL-7 gas will make for more chaotic and engaging fights.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures, the new DMR, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a solid addition and will probably be my new choice of DMR, but my appreciation for it was outweighed by my lack of appreciation for the new assault rifle, the <strong>VCR-2</strong>.</p>



<p>My hope would be that it gets tuned in an upcoming patch, because it felt absolutely useless in the few rounds I tried it. I should say again that I only had two hours to check everything out, which doesn't leave a lot of time to get stuck in menus trying out different attachments. I went with the default layout, swapping to a couple of its different pre-determined builds, but nothing seemed to help. I'll add one more caveat that, because I was playing a build that was flagged as a "<em>work-in-progress build</em>," there could be a bug causing the weapon to do less damage than it should. Again, I would hope that's the case, but as someone who enjoys playing as the Assault class and utilizing an array of assault rifles, it flat out sucks to see the newest one be as useless as this.</p>



<p>I did, however, quite enjoy using the new <strong>M121 A2</strong> belt-fed LMG for the reps I had with it. Again, you can only get so much experience with everything in just two hours. But as Meatloaf always reminds me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hWWe-ts2s">two out of three ain't bad</a>, so I'd still call the new weapons arriving in Extreme Measures to be an overall win.</p>



<h2 id="h-looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Coming back to the question I asked in the title of this preview, could LTMs like the addition of VL-7 gas and the upcoming Nightfall mode and Operation Augur be enough to bring lapsed Battlefield 6 players like myself back to the game? It's possible, of course, but it'll depend on how quickly Battlefield Studios and EA are in responding to player feedback, especially if that feedback is similar to what I would offer, which is that the addition of features like the VL-7 gas should stick around and not be limited.</p>



<p>Regarding Nightfall, it'll also depend on whether the mode is executed in a similar fashion to the VL-7 gas, where it adds a fun layer of chaos or if it pushes further into the territory where it's frustrating to play through. And as for Operation Augur, frankly, that seems like it'll be the most fun by the time it comes around, which makes it even more disappointing for me that we didn't get a chance to try it out in this preview.</p>



<p>The reality is that Season 1 was always going to be a tough act to follow for Season 2. Besides the fact that it seems like we're getting one map fewer than we did before, it's not like Battlefield Studios was going to have something as big as REDSEC ready to try and hit the same highs as Season 1. And even if it did, that only passes the buck to Season 3 as the one that is set up to be more disappointing than the last.</p>



<p>When I look at the Season 2 roadmap, I can't help but feel it's counterproductive to have your biggest attractions also be LTMs, like you're trying to grab players' attention through FOMO. I can understand not wanting to commit to something that players might not love in the long run by automatically making them permanent, but it also doesn't present a strong pitch for why I should care about what's coming in Season 2 right now.</p>

It’s the most we’ve seen of the Hardsuit Labs draft of the sequel since publishers Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">took Hardsuit off Bloodlines 2 in 2021</a>, kicking original Bloodlines head designer Brian Mitsoda to the curb, and transferring development to The Chinese Room.</p><p>Released last year, the Chinese Room’s take on Bloodlines 2 has its charms – RPS reviewer Dominic Tarason <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">called it</a> “an entertaining but flawed vampire brawler wrapped in a compelling mystery story” – but many World of Darkness enthusiasts pine nonetheless for what might have been.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 has confirmed that the visuals will not be lowered for the multiplatform release. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade has already been released for Xbox and Switch 2, and the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-xbox-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rebirth</a> has also been confirmed for both platforms. The developers have announced that FFVII Remake Part 3 will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-part-3-confirmed-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on additional platforms</a> as well. However, players have expressed concerns that optimizing for lower-spec systems might compromise the graphics quality. The director has now addressed these concerns and assured players.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-multiplatform-release-won-t-impact-the-visuals">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 Multiplatform Release Won’t Impact the Visuals</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 director Naoki Hamaguchi said the multiplatform release would not affect the graphics. Hamaguchi stated, “our decision to go&nbsp;multiplatform&nbsp;with&nbsp;the FFVII Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment.&nbsp;Our development structure simply&nbsp;doesn’t&nbsp;work that way&nbsp;to begin with.&nbsp;…I suppose&nbsp;I’ll&nbsp;just have to keep saying&nbsp;it.” </p>



<p>The director split it into 4 aspects to explain how quality won’t be affected. First, he stated that, in terms of ROM, none of the platforms is a concern. Coming to RAM, the Switch 2 has “ample” memory, whereas the Xbox Series S has its limits, but they optimize&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;platform individually. </p>



<p>Coming to CPUs, the studio doesn’t&nbsp;“design the game to fully saturate a high-end CPU at 30fps”; instead, they “scale density elements,&nbsp;like&nbsp;increasing the number of NPCs in towns”. Lastly, for the GPU, the director stated that assets are created for&nbsp;high-end environments first, then optimised for each platform’s constraints. The highest-end environment is PC, PS5, and PS5 Pro, which are considered mid-range platforms. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is sticking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unreal Engine 4</a>. The Switch 2 gameplay experience for FF7 Rebirth will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar to other platforms</a>.

IGN's Michael Higham said it's "an investment that pays back multiple times over in its 120-hour runtime. It’s a commitment - a slow-burn game you have to want to live in. But it’s also an action-packed cinematic adventure that proves to have an emotional range that the original didn’t."</p></div><div id="235576"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235576" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Xbox Series X</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Writer Leana Hafer's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">review</a> at the time of release also said it's "Armed with excellent melee combat and an exceptional story," and called it "one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has confirmed that the upcoming open world action adventure game does not have a cosmetic cash shop or microtransactions of any kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert, due out March 19 priced $69.99, is set in a huge and seamless open world packed with enemies, NPCs, and all sorts of things to do. But one thing players won’t have to contend with is a cosmetic cash shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop,” Will Powers, director of marketing at Pearl Abyss America, told weekly talk show <a href="https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=JPSch4-nwZYHCeDv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Okami13_</a>). “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s a monetization model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, that’s microtransactions ruled out, which is sure to go down well with gamers who are hoping for a traditional single-player experience from Crimson Desert. The game has been slowly gaining hype over recent years, but that’s ramped up significantly in the last few months as Pearl Abyss shared more gameplay footage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around protagonist Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-reveals-more-about-combat-and-progression-confirms-dual-wielding-and-a-bear-you-can-actually-ride-on">You can even ride a bear</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Powers has called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open-world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world wouldn't determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor. "The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> gameplay trailer reveal, I sat down with the game's makers for an in-depth chat revealing its new systems and story mode, and a proper discussion on why this marks the triumphant return of track-based racing, after so many open world games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Galactic Racer is the first project from British studio Fuse Games, which was founded in 2023 by a core of former colleagues from Criterion, the beloved band behind Burnout and later Need for Speed titles, before it got gobbled up to become part of Battlefield Studios. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, as Fuse Games' team races towards a galaxy far, far away, I caught up with its CEO and founder Matt Webster, plus creative director Kieran Crimmins, for an intriguing chat on what's to come.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Obviously you've been announced for a little while now, but I've been looking forward to seeing more from the moment Fuse Games was announced, considering your long heritage at Criterion. And the game looks great, from what I've seen of it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Matt Webster:</strong> Was it along the lines of what you imagined? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Well, I remember you did that </strong><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>GI interview</strong></a><strong> and you were sort of hedging your bets on what genre of game you were going to be working on... And I was like, 'they're clearly making a racing game, I don't even know why they're pretending.'</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Kieran Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] We've made spaceship stuff before, so that was possible. It's not [what we're making] but possible. Who were we kidding!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Maybe you were working on another Battlefield game! But probably not. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] Yeah, fair enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I had lots of questions about what </strong><em><strong>kind </strong></em><strong>of racer you guys were planning to make — open world or not, and we'll get onto that. But when you made that announcement about first setting up, did you have an outline of what you wanted to do? What was that journey like from leaving Criterion to the announcement of Star Wars? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> We thought we were going really fast, but we're three years old now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> That's crazy isn't it, you've made whole games in that time before. [But] we've never set up studios in that time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> That is true. Where this comes from is, first of all, a shared love of racing and a shared love of Star Wars. But when there's a new studio, new team, new tech, new creative... every time there's new, you've got an element of risk. So when we're thinking about it at studio level going, 'well, okay, well how do you mitigate some of those risks?' We can mitigate tech risk by using Unreal or technologies that exist. We can mitigate people risk by working with some folks that we already know and we can mitigate some creative risk by playing in some things that we already know. So I guess it's a mixture of those two, but the more you think about it, you then say, 'okay, why hasn't there been a Star Wars racing game for so long?'</p><p>"We always play to our strengths..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, I mean obviously we kicked around a bunch of concepts because that's good game making. You want to think about what you're doing. We always play to our strengths. We've got a certain sensibilities of how we like to make games. I'm sure if you've played any of what we've worked on that DNA is going to be present here, as it is in everything we do. And that's one of the things that the studio is based, that mutual understanding and long history of shared love for certain types of mechanics and experiences around thrilling, fast arcade racing games. [And then there was that] shared love for the Star Wars universe... we were like, 'oh my gosh, imagine all the things that we love but actually transferred into there as well as the heritage of the movies with podracing or all the racing experiences in there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, when you put that together, it was fairly obvious that was probably going to be the best game we could make for our first game. It would just be the best game that we could make full stop. And then we took that to our partners in Lucasfilm, because we worked with them before, we know them, so we could say, 'Hey guys, what do you think of this thing?' And they basically said the same thing back to us where they were like, 'yeah, we are really excited about this stuff. We love that stuff that you doing. That absolutely makes sense for us.' And as soon as you have that kind of mutual excitement, it's like, we've got to make this happen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It sounds like there was a sort of mutual appreciation there from Lucasfilm. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Well, we've got a shared history. I think our first [time on Star Wars was] when we were at Criterion, I remember the folks at DICE were like, 'we think it's an impossible mission, but if anyone can do it, you can,' and it was speeder bikes through Endor, just that fantasy. We've all got it in our heads. And so we just approached that as we would do delivering on any fantasies. Our previous fantasies used to be sports car fantasies. Well, the best way around the corner for me was always all four wheels smoking and sideways with a big smile on your face. We work on those levels, and as Kieran was saying earlier, there's that shared appreciation of the type of experience we want to do, but that history just means something. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then through to the [Star Wars Battlefront Rogue One] X-Wing VR mission [a free VR add-on to Star Wars Battlefront], which was one of our most favorite things to do and was really wonderful. There's clearly an appreciation of the work and that goes a long way. So I think there's the meeting of those two things together, people with an understanding of how both sides work, a mutual respect of one another and a desire to go and execute on something that looks like a wonderful opportunity. It's a  great starting point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned a question there that I'd love to ask back to you, which is: why hasn't there been a Star Wars racer in so long? Is it that you guys weren't free, you were busy making Battlefield? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Maybe! I dunno, the obvious answers are only obvious once they exist, I suppose. For us at least, there's that thing of 'can we make a Star Wars racing game?' And then there's the 'okay, well what should we do?' Because I think we wanted to do things a little differently or we wanted to do something different, and that extends to what you are racing. Some of the mechanics inside racing we want to bring some fresh life into, as well as it being a Star Wars racing experience. I can't answer the question of how come no one else has thought about it? Maybe it's a question of timing. But once we had that, it was like, 'okay, how can we do something different with racing and Star Wars?' </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, it's funny. I see it more like the time was right now rather than the time was wrong before. You're right we were on other projects, we were talking about other things and I'm sure there were other teams working other things, but it's that weird thing of both luck and timing. Whenever you make a video game, it's a mixture of so many elements. It's a little bit hard to get the lightning in the bottle, but when we did this brief and we got this together, we were like, 'this is the perfect time to make this thing.' And I believe we're the perfect studio to make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned wanting to do things in a Star Wars racer that haven't been done before. We got a look at gameplay last week but what more can you say about what you are doing, and also how people familiar with your past work might feel that DNA in this? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> Well, you'll be the best judge of that. It should come through immediately what we're aiming for here in terms of the experience, [addressing] that in some ways HD players have been a little bit underserved by just some kickass track racing experiences. We love those types of games. We love making them, we love playing them, but we wanted to bring a modern view on what that experience could be. You touched on it a little bit earlier about open world, but we wanted to actually come back to tracks. There's a lot of great stuff about tracks in that I replay, my mastery of a circuit comes from replayability, and we definitely are leaning into that from a game structure perspective. That recognition and the repetition and the familiarity of racing circuits,  gets you outside some of the compromises you might make when you do an open world racing game. We knew we wanted to come back into delivering that type of experience for a modern player at 4K 60 with just really super strong visuals in a galaxy far, far away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But like I said, we want to do things differently. So how can we breed some innovation in racing? We're doing that in a couple of ways we can touch into. One is the mechanical boost system. Boost has been in and around racing games forever. Press the button, go fast, consume the boost, and you've got a sort of a tactical decision-making going on there. But we wanted to do something more. So we have a two-phase boost system. The second phase is something called a ramjet, which just goes really, really, really fast, but it's got a consequence too — it generates a load of heat, and if run it for too long, you're going to explode. So you've got consequence there. You've got a second phase of tactical decision making going on. And more importantly, it ties into Star Wars locations. So when we think about where we race in Star Wars, the locations are characters in amongst themselves. </p><p>"So we have a two-phase boost system..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know them by name — Hoth, Endor, Jakku, Tatooine — and we really wanted to bring that in as an integral part of the game. So the environment has a tactical part to play in terms of your racing, and it plays its part in the ramjet. So in Lantaana — a lush, tropical rainforest vibe on an active volcano island planet — we've got rivers of lava and rivers of water, hot and cold. And so you have those decisions — the environmental heat helps get my ramjet up to operating temperature, but it's obviously going to get it hotter, quicker. I can also cool the ramjet, running it for longer over the colder water. And that's just a little example of a mechanical change that we're getting people thinking differently about [as they're making] their racing line choices at a second to second level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Yeah, this is probably the first game we've made where the racing line can be that variable depending on the vehicle you're driving, the kind of build you've got within that vehicle, and the environment. This is a game where there isn't just one racing line, there's the one for your current situation, which means every time you attend the galactic tour it's a different experience and a different set of things that you're thinking about. There's quite a lot there and we're not talking about all of it now, but high level, we want to make an arcade racing experience that's richer than it's ever been before with more options and more things to do than ever before. I really think we've got some interesting stuff in this game that I've certainly never done in a video game, and I don't think I've seen it in other racing games either. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> While not losing that essence of delivering a racing pilot fantasy from second one, [where you] pick up the path, have a great time, but because you'll know from our past and the way we go about engineering things, you've got a pretty high skill ceiling there for players that really want to drive for mastery so we can support a really broad range of play motivations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've given some great reasons for this to be a track racer, but I wanted to get your thoughts on open world racing, which you've got a lot of history with too. It was really interesting to see the debate about it going on last year — sparked by Mario Kart World, which obviously is a very different kind of racer — but I saw a lot of people come out and suggest there was a nostalgia for a track-based experience. Have you noticed that too? Did it help you feel more emboldened with your approach?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> [Laughs] I didn't notice that, but I would say this... I did play all those games and felt all those things. I absolutely love making open world racers. I've made a bunch, there's plenty more in me, I look forward to doing some of those at some point. I absolutely love track based races, some of my favorite early games are track based racers, and I think there's wonderful experiences to be had there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Has open world reached a point where it's just been done a lot?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins: </strong>I don't think it's as simple as that overall. I think there's great fun, innovation and things to do in both of those spaces. And I certainly, if I go to design a game or picture a game, I'm going to pick the version that does the thing that we want the best rather than I want this one or I want this one. In this game we really wanted something that was really replayable, something that really had that great replay loop, something that every time you replayed it, you felt like you got something new out of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is weird, I can't remember who wrote it but there was an article about 'why aren't racing games like shooters, why is the innovation different?' I think it's because racers, you just need more stuff to do in the race in the second-to-second. We talked about the tactical layer of the ramjet system and how that works with the boost, but I think that goes across the board with the whole genre. It used to be a very, very innovative genre, but it's hard to push innovation in a space where your cognitive load is fairly small because you're in a kind of dynamic system of where you're moving around. Getting that right is a lot harder than other games. I just like to see really, really great experiences that really tighten focus. Then that's what we want to make here. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Games That Never Were</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason we're a track-based racer is because we wanted to have that replayability loop that expands over time. All those benefits people learn in the tracks, the more they play, learning the handling, that familiarity getting them better rather than just a massive smorgasbord of a thing, which is a slightly different kind of 'play with the toys' experience. This is high consequence, high action, high replayability and something that creates player stories that you wouldn't have seen in other games. And I don't think we could do that if we would go in and say, okay, we're also going to do this open world thing. That's a whole set of different challenges. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> You're right, and you can also say, well, this is the Galactic League, right? This is sport, and we've seen racing as an activity and as a sport in Star Wars has been around in many forms, right? Episode 1's podracing we all know and love, Bad Batch's riot racing in Season 2 was just awesome. Star Wars Resistance has got the Aces and low-altitude starfighter racing. Racing as a sport and activity is something that's inside Star Wars, and tracks lend themselves to that really well at an action level. And the other thing we realize more broadly is we are inside Star Wars. And Star Wars fans crave the characters and a story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we wanted to go there as well, in a way that frames the racing action. So, you play as a character who is racing, as opposed to it being a racing game. We've made plenty of racing games where you're just a faceless silhouette in a car. Now you're inhabiting Shade, you're a canonical new Star Wars character. You walk down one of the shots in the trailer, you're walking down the ramp of your starship, you're going into a paddock. And this is really interesting addition here where the paddock gives us a place, a low intensity space where we can get up close with our Star Wars stuff, we can move a narrative on, we can see characters inside there. It gives us a low intensity space as a counterpoint and a contrast to the super high intensity racing. And I think it's a really important distinction for us now as we call this a racing adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In the trailer, we see Shade interacting with other characters in that area. So to be clear, it's not just a place for cutscenes between races. There is an area where you can walk around rather than drive around and interact with characters.</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> In those spaces, yeah, you can walk around, interact with characters, you can build rivalries, you can upgrade your plethora of skimmers and have some nice character moments as well, because as Matt said, this is the story of the Galactic Racing League and Shade coming to that and to tell that story, we needed some time with the characters as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is funny, I wasn't thinking about it as a key innovation because it's kind of a no-brainer. This is a Star Wars racing game, and we wanted to have a proper single-player mode in there where we could actually tell a story in this world of what this Galactic Racing league is and immerse people in the authentic Star Wars world with both familiar characters and a plethora of new characters as well. We had to have a space where you're able to do that and we're a gameplay first studio, so we didn't want that to be a cut-scene space.</p><p>"We learned making Burnout: you can only spend so long with your eyes on stalks at 200 miles an hour — or in our case, 400 miles an hour"<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've shown podracers, but these things are like seven or eight meters long and they're enormous, but you don't really get that sense of scale unless you are walking around them as a character and looking around at all this beautiful detail that we built into them. That space serves so many purposes for us in terms of as an immersion space, as a lower intensity. We learned while making Burnout: there's only so long you can spend with your eyes on stalks at 200 miles an hour — or in our case, 400 miles an hour. You need a decompressed moment. And the paddock does a brilliant job of allowing us that mechanism for us to do all of those things. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm running out of time, but </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-galactic-racer-trailer-confirms-the-return-of-another-phantom-menace-character-sony-state-of-play"><strong>we've now seen Ben Quadinaros and Sebulba</strong></a><strong>. Are there any more familiar faces in there?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> There's going to be a good mix of familiar faces and new characters. Obviously we want to get that mix right, so no matter what kind of Star Wars media you've engaged with, whether it be a movie or game, there's a bunch of familiarity in there when it comes to the space. Otherwise it wouldn't feel like an authentic Star Wars experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Are you using any kind of season pass model? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> No. This is a premium release, right? We have our campaign and we have arcade mode and we have multiplayer, and it's a self-contained thing. But what we also recognize is that the landscape of Star Wars evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more Star Wars or new Star Wars over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post launch is going to look like, that's not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that's not what we are making. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Our mindset right now is a premium release, to try and get an amazing experience out the box. Obviously we wouldn't close the door to doing something later, but that isn't what we are really thinking about right now. We just want it to be the very best game it can be, and we want it to be complete when it comes out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>People have been avidly working out when the game takes place in canon and according to Wookiepedia it's definitely after 5ABY because of the crashed Star Destroyers following the Battle of Jakku. How much are you playing into the established canon? We've already seen Sebulba — and I suppose that was a surprise to me that he'd made it through the events of the trilogy alive. Will we find out exactly when it's set or does that not really matter?</strong> </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Webster:</strong> I don't think it really matters. As you say, you're on Jakku after the events of Return of the Jedi, the galactic civil war is over and that's where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don't think we're ever specific about timeline beyond that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I love Sebulba's beard, I just wanted to say. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Crimmins:</strong> Old Bulba!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p>The old "platform expansion", eh?</p>

<figure data-uuid="955cbbc138351"><a title="Stellar Blade" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/955cbbc138351/stellar-blade.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Sony Interactive Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen several ports come our way in the last eight months that would have been nothing more than a pipedream on Switch 1, and it looks like another title that got everyone talking on PS5 back in 2024 might make the jump to the new Nintendo hybrid, too.</p>
<p>We're talking about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stellar_blade">Stellar Blade</a>, of course, the action-adventure title from Sony Interactive Entertainment and Shift Up. In the developer's latest <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">financial report</a>, the team discussed what it hopes to see the game achieve in 2026, noting, "We are reviewing platform expansion beyond PS5 and PC to broaden audience reach. This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series".</p>
<p>Now, okay, there's no specific mention of Switch 2 in there, and the platform expansion is merely being <em>reviewed</em> at the moment, but if it's audience reach that Shift Up is after, we struggle to think of a better destination than Nintendo's latest.</p>
<p>"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," the note concludes.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade enjoyed PS5 exclusivity for the best part of a year before the PC version was released in June 2025. With its sequel now in development, it makes sense that the team would want to broaden its reach to attract as big an audience as possible, it just remains to be seen whether Switch 2 or a straight-up Xbox Series port is the way to do it.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more info this year, and will keep you updated with any juicy Switch 2 nuggets.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-creator-doesnt-know-what-sony-santa-monica-was-thinking-with-sons-of-sparta/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, after a long period of silence following the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">final piece of DLC</a> for <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, during Sony's first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> of 2026, we finally got a small update as to what <strong>Sony Santa Monica</strong> has been working on. Along with <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/">a remake of the original trilogy</a>, we learned that the studio had teamed up with <strong>Mega Cat Studios</strong> to deliver a 2.5D game featuring Kratos titled <strong>God of War: Sons of Sparta</strong>.</p>



<p>There have been a lot of rumours circulating for years about an <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-god-of-war-is-reportedly-considered-for-a-multiplatform-release-day-one-on-pc-or-something-more/">upcoming 2.5D God of War game</a>, so its arrival was both surprising and not; surprising because after hearing nothing but rumours for a while, it was fair to wonder if it was even going to come out at all, and also not because we'd heard so much about it for so long.</p>



<p>Now that it was confirmed and shadow-dropped at the same time, we're starting to see plenty of reactions to the new 2.5D action game, one of which comes from <strong>David Jaffe</strong>, best known as one of the original creators behind the God of War franchise. To say that he's not fond of this new game would be an understatement.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God of War Creator REVIEWS Sons Of Sparta!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liEszJCMW-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em><strong>This is not God of War</strong></em>," an exasperated Jaffe says in his first of three videos he's now made on the game, the first of which you can see above. "<em>What were they [Sony Santa Monica] thinking, like what the f*** are they thinking?</em>" he continues, as he explains that he doesn't believe the game to be bad overall, calling it "<em>fine</em>," but adds that what he finds offensive in it is how generic the game is, and how he believes this is not the game that God of War fans would have wanted if you were to pitch them the idea of playing a 2.5D Metroidvania-style game in Sony's long-running franchise.</p>



<p>Jaffe adds that he doesn't believe anyone wants to play as "<em>kids</em>" in a God of War video game. "<em>Nobody wants to kids! We don't want to play as Atreus; we don't want a spin-off as Atreus. Why do you guys keep making games about 15-year-old boys? Leave me alone! Go to Epstein's Island or something, whatever the f*** it is, I don't know what they're doing, but leave me the f*** alone! I want to be Kratos motherf*****!"</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="God Of War Sons Of Sparta NOT READY for release" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ClC7rCietLU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Though his first video can be described as an emotional rant fueled by only playing one hour of the game, in subsequent videos after playing a little more of Sons of Sparta, he digs further into his problems with it, citing issues of "<em>visual noise</em>" and an overall lack of polish, because while some people might call the probelms he's pointing out to be "<em>minor</em>," for him, not including even these 'minor' issues in the first place is "<em>what it means to make a first-party game</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Jaffe believes players wanted something closer to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blasphemous-review/">Blasphemous</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-summer-2025-release/">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>,</strong> and <strong>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</strong>. A smooth, ultra-violent, 2.5D action game where players don't play as a younger, prequel-era Kratos, but as the Ghost of Sparta he was before he became the Kratos we know from the Norse-era games. He adds that if you were to "<em>pull God of War</em>," as in remove the well-known IP from the game and present it as a 2.5D action game about a young Spartan, people would not be interested in playing it.</p>



<p>He's also butting up against the studio's shift in priorities to be more driven by storytelling, instead of the action gameplay that drove the original trilogy. </p>



<p>"<em>It [Sons of Sparta] reminds me of a conversation I had with someone that is no longer at Sony Santa Monica, when</em> <em>we were talking about the sequence in God of War Ragnarok that a lot of people complain about, which is where Atreus is going on that long sled, walk, whatever, with that girl he likes and it just goes on and on and on. And I said to this person, 'Why didn't they recognize, didn't focus tests tell them that this was boring and they should maybe cut that or truncate it?'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>And they said to me - and this is one person's opinion, but they would know, they were certainly in the know. They said, 'Sony Santa Monica these days is driven mostly, or primarily, by story</em>.' <em>And I'm like, 'Oh my god.'</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="IS Jaffe SALTY About God Of War?!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzruHkjMCfI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Jaffe also claims that anyone who says he is "<em>salty</em>" is wrong and that his only motive for talking about his displeasure with Sons of Sparta begins and ends with him just not liking the game. A statement that is difficult to take on its face, since Jaffe is primarily a content creator now, and all of these videos about his displeasure with the game are fueling what appears to be his main source of income.</p>

The developers say they've identified "a few areas that need further refinement", so taking extra time to work on them is "the right decision".</p><figure role="group">

<p>In case you need a reminder, while <em>Icarus </em>was developed by Rocketwerkz on PC, console development and publishing will be handled by Grip Studios, whose name you might know from its support work on games like <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09ba0fb1-40df-4991-9f55-2f16878ad8e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>.</p><p>News of the delay of <em>Icarus</em>' console release comes a month or so after Dean Hall and Rocketwerkz announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the game's sales skyrocketed</a> during the most recent Steam winter sale, so we can expect that number to increase further once the console versions arrive.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Icarus</em>, it's an open-world survival game in which you and your friends (or just you, if you're the solitary type) must descend onto a planet on which the terraforming process has gone wrong.</p><p>Once there, you can choose either to play in a sandbox-style open world or to complete individual missions, but either way, you'll be exploring your surroundings, building structures to help you stay alive, and hunting local wildlife for resources.</p>
<p><em>Icarus </em>now launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10013354" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/icarus-console-edition/9P3H2PVZZPSD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 26th.

              <p>I know what you were thinking: You were tentatively looking forward to April 3’s <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, but you just weren’t convinced it was going to feature your all-time favorite character, R.O.B. the Robot. Well break out the ticket purchases, because as Nintendo attempts to throw every last scrap of shit at the wall, ol’ Robby’s going to be in there too. A fact that has been leaked by his teensy appearance in a forthcoming tie-in toy set.</p> <p>A whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> merch has been announced just recently, due to go on sale in the first week of April. There’s a six-inch <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-toy-exclusive-reveal/">Yoshi egg complete with chatty Yoshi inside</a>, already <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/fashion-and-dolls/interactive-pets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg/p/254238">up for pre-order in the UK</a> at an eye-watering £60 ($81), alongside <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-deluxe-bowser-castle-playset/p/252460">a Bowser Castle Playset</a> and <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-with-star-launcher-set/p/254896001">star-shaped launchers</a> that kwa-ping characters into your eye.</p>

  <p>But hidden among all these reveals (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-old-spice-and-pillsbury-cookie-leaks-a-deep-cut-super-mario-galaxy-movie-cameo-has-been-revealed-by-toy-packaging/"><em>Total Film</em></a>) appears one certain robot. We found an even clearer image in a YouTube review of the Super Mario Galaxy Movie Jakks Gateway Galaxy Playset:</p>  <p>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) originally appeared as a peripheral toy for the NES in 1985. The character then sporadically popped up as a deep dive in various games, first showing his metal face in&nbsp;<em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em> in 1996, popping up in various&nbsp;<em>WarioWare</em> games, and most notably being a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart DS </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>titles. However, somewhat pertinently, he didn’t make an appearance in <em>Super Mario Galaxy.</em></p>

 <p>R.O.B.’s inclusion does rather lean in to the notion that this&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie is going to be less an epic tale told in the specific video games’ universe, and more another attempt to just cram in as many&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> references as possible for the nostalgic nerds and hope the bright colors keep the kiddies happy. The trailers so far have failed to suggest any form of cogent plot, but rather just bombarding us with nods to familiar aspects of the franchise, with a lot of focus on <em>Super Mario Odyssey.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Switch Emulation Dev Is Fighting Back Against Nintendo’s New Takedowns: ‘We Want To Keep Continuing The Work In The Preservation Of Video Games’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-emulator-eden-nintendo-legal-takedown-2000669430</link>
            <guid>1437331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo’s fired off a new volley of legal notices against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">Switch emulation scene</a>. Close to a dozen GitHub pages were hit with DMCA takedown requests over the weekend. However, while several of the Nintendo Switch GitHub pages have given in to Nintendo’s demands, the development team behind the Eden emulator has boldly refused. Instead, they proceed with publishing a new v0.2.0 build of the Eden Switch emulator on GitHub just days later.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You may remember that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440"><span>back in 2024</span></a><span>, Yuzu and Ryujinx, the two most well-known Switch emulators, were subject to legal takedown notices from Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441">following a massive million dollar settlement</a>. Nintendo’s crackdown on the Switch emulation scene scattered homebrew efforts to various, less easily accessed corners of the internet. But the cat and mouse game has continued over the years, and Nintendo is once again trying to prune back grassroots efforts to reverse-engineer <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">its most popular console ever</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>You could argue that, technically, the majority of these emulators aren’t exactly new, as almost all of them are forks (an offshoot of the existing codebase) of either Yuzu or Ryujinx. In the case of Eden, this is true, as the Nintendo Switch emulator is a fork of Yuzu. In spite of this, Eden’s development team seems relatively un-phased by Nintendo’s latest wave of DMCA notices. The project’s founder isn’t being shy about the team plan to fight back against the company’s latest legal offensive.</span></p>   <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/"><i><span>Wccftech</span></i></a><span>, Eden founder Camille LaVey revealed that they believe the emulator’s GitHub page isn’t breaking any of the website’s hosting policies: “Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we’re never sure of what the future can bring, so we’re always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As of writing, Eden’s GitHub page is still up, even though GitHub clearly states that pages issued with DMCA notices have roughly “1 business day to make requested changes” before being removed. Tied with LaVey’s statement to </span><i><span>Wccftech</span></i><span>, this likely means that the Eden team has issued a counter notice against Nintendo.</span></p>

 <p>Even if Eden’s stand is short-lived, emulation enthusiasts are adamant that Nintendo’s crusade will never be able to completely eradicate Switch emulation from the internet. “If they kill one, 10 more will pop up,” wrote one commenter on the Android emulation subreddit. “Kill 10, 100 more will pop up. They can never kill emulation.”</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has slowly but steadily become one of 2026's open world games to watch out for, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visually-impressive-open-world-fantasy-adventure-crimson-desert-goes-gold-locks-march-launch">with a March release date now locked</a>, lots of people are seriously starting to consider making a trip to Pywel soon. At the same time, veterans might have reservations about jumping in at launch based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a>'s MTX-heavy model.</p>
<p>Of course, large numbers of microtransactions and optional cosmetics are to be expected any time a game's model is free-to-play, and Pearl Abyss' PR and marketing director Will Powers reminded everyone of that during his appearance in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">episode 457 of the Dropped Frames</a> podcast (hat tip to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/that-is-the-transaction-crimson-desert-wont-have-microtransactions-says-pearl-abyss-because-the-promising-open-world-game-is-a-premium-experience/">GamesRadar</a>): "It's a monetization model: if you do free-to-play, then you need to make up the revenue in a different way." Easy to understand if you've been playing video games in the last 20 years or so, but we all know we often need to make things as clear as possible.</p>
<p>You can't blame veterans for thinking even a strictly single-player game like Crimson Desert (which did start off as an online project) could be filled with microtransactions à la Assassin's Creed though. After all, it'd be easy for Pearl Abyss to pull the trigger on those if the game is a massive success, as we know for a fact players typically like putting more money into the experiences they greatly enjoy.</p>
<p>Powers shot such thoughts and comments down quickly: "This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions." Here's where we underline such decisions are above his pay grade and anything could happen post-launch, but it seems that's where Pearl Abyss officially stands right now. If you're picking up Crimson Desert, you're getting a traditional, fully featured open-world adventure with no cosmetics or mounts earned via MTX. "This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Like, full stop."</p><p>That said, <a href="https://crimsondesert.pearlabyss.com/en-US/Main">Crimson Desert has three different editions</a> (both digital and physical) up for pre-order at the time of writing, each of which with extra items and cosmetics, so you're definitely missing out on some stuff if you simply pick up the cheaper version. <a href="https://x.com/WillJPowers/status/2023218876105072790?s=20">Powers has acknowledged those</a> on X/Twitter though: "The overall point is that we're not holding back content to sell separately."</p>
<p>In any case, I doubt anyone was fearing Crimson Desert could be short on content, as every piece of footage from the game we've seen suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4euv-AX4E">it's trying to do <em>almost </em>everything</a> the devs came up with during the concept and planning stage. Will it pay off? It won't be long before we find out, as the game launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and even Mac on 19th March.</p>

			<p>I play a lot of horror demos during each and every Steam Next Fest, and more often than not, games that I am unaware of make their way into my Wishlist. Crisol: Theater of Idols was a strange case that went the other way as Blumhouse’s latest game looked superb, but the demo emphasised an unkillable stalker enemy that felt at odds with the gunplay and atmosphere of the game. I kind of took my eyes off Crisol after that, but I am very happy to declare that I was wrong to do so. Having now spent the past few days absolutely immersed in the world of Crisol, I consider it to be one of my favourite action horror games in years, and one that feels an absolute steal at its bargain retail price.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crisol: Theater of Idols - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JiJ5g5wc9hM?start=5&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story and world-building of Crisol is absolutely superb, and genuinely feels up there with the best of Resident Evil and FromSoft. You begin as Gabriel, a stranded captain on a mysterious shore, entrusted with a mission by the God of the Sun to seal the evil power of the God of the Sea. Gabriel is a devout soldier but one who seems tormented by the conflicting voices of doubt and conviction – conveyed through some fabulous audio design that rewards wearing headphones. Soon after beginning his adventure, Gabriel is confronted by automaton mannequins that seem invulnerable to his pistol and he is swiftly dealt with.</p>


<p>What should be the end, however, proves to just be the beginning as the God of Sun offers his power to Gabriel in the form of a grotesque link between his blood and his weapons. Normal firearms become magical guns when they are absorbed by his magical blood and can hurt the uncanny foes that stalk the streets and buildings of Hispania. It is not just the nature of the weapons that is transformed, though, as the ammunition they fire is manifested from your blood as well. What follows is a unique twist on the conventional risk and reward of survival horror as you must manage your health and ammo from one pool.</p>


<p>Hispania is a darkly beautiful setting, with ruined streets and interiors that defy periodisation as the game could be taking place any time from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century to the current day (the only clear nod to a more modern date being a radio that you use to communicate with friends and sometimes antagonists). The architecture evokes the timeless splendour of Spanish cities, whilst reminding me a lot of the world of Resident Evil 4 – a game that is a clear influence here. Voice acting is mostly very strong – although I will be playing again in Spanish to really set the mood. There have been some complaints about your companion Mediodia being too upbeat for the tone but I quite liked the contrast this enables. Music is excellent and songs can be unlocked by collecting hidden vinyl records in the game.</p>
<p>Your starting pistol is relatively underpowered even when bloodily enhanced but you can level it up as you progress. In the middle of the game it was my primary weapon with a great balance between power and blood cost for ammunition. A shotgun and a rifle are found later in the game and are hugely effective but come at a much higher blood cost. You also have a knife which can be used to parry attacks but has a limited durability to manage. I struggled to time the parry in my playthrough but will practice in future ones – hopefully the window is patched to be a bit more forgiving.</p>

<p>Combat is brutal and visceral as the mannequin enemies are unrelenting in their attacks. Their rigid, inhuman movements are terrifying in the gloom of many areas, and their horrifying appearance is exacerbated by the fact that they keep on coming even when decapitated or dismembered. Managing your ammo and targets when multiple foes are lurching, crawling or even firing ranged weapons at you is truly thrilling in a way that few games manage aside from Leon Kennedy’s best adventures. There is some welcome variety in enemy as the game progresses, with a later crystal/glass foe being particularly difficult to counter.</p>
<p>The aforementioned invincible stalker is far more cohesive in the full game than I found in the early demo. Delores is a twisted mix of robot and statue with a tendency to taunt you as she stomps unerringly towards you. The stealth sections featuring her are not my favourite parts of the game but they were not frequent enough to disrupt my enjoyment and actually offered a great change of pace from the more action-orientated moments.</p>

<p>The final aspect of the game is a focus on puzzles that goes even beyond the influence of Capcom’s legendary series. Aside from finding key items and environmental puzzles involving gears and timed gates, there are regular logic puzzles that range from enjoyable to truly infuriating without ever being too frustrating. Some of these are takes on the familiar but all benefit from fitting the unique aesthetic to perfection. I will admit that one particular late game example involving making up an image from two concentric circles made me pause the game and take a break for a while.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Crisol: Theater of Idols is a unique take on survival horror that has swiftly became one of my favourite games in a long while. It takes classics like Resident Evil 4 and Bioshock and fuses them into a brand new nightmare. The twisting narrative, the mix of gameplay mechanics, and the sheer visceral thrill of the game once it gets its claws into you all combine to make this perhaps my happiest gaming surprise in years. If this glowing review wasn’t enough to convince you, it’s even priced incredibly competitively and puts many far more expensive titles to shame. Crisol truly deserves to become more than just a cult classic and will be in the conversation for horror game of the year, even with some obvious competition on the horizon.	</p></div>

            <title><![CDATA[The ROG Xbox Ally X Price Shoots Up Nearly $200 In Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424</link>
            <guid>1437289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is one of the premier PC gaming handhelds currently on the market. Despite some half-baked UI tweaks and finnicky Windows holdovers, it’s an <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">excellent way to play PC games on the go</a>, for existing Xbox and Game Pass users. The only problem when it launched last fall was the $1,000 price tag. And in Japan at least, that’s just gone up even higher.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/rog-xbox-ally-x-20260216-421609/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Asus has raised the price of the ROG Xbox Ally X in Japan from 139,800 yen tax included ($911)&nbsp; to 169,800 yen tax included ($1,107). That’s a jump of 30,000 yen or almost $200 at the current exchange rate. Notably, the price hasn’t been chanced on Microsoft’s website in Japan, though its listing for the ROG Xbox Ally X then sends users to the Asus page with the new price.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, the base ROG Xbox Ally price has remained the same. That price is still listed at 89,800 yen, or roughly $585. One obvious reason for the discrepancy is that the regular Xbox Ally has 16GB of LPDDR5-6400 memory compared to 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 in the Xbox Ally X. As RAM prices spike amid the ongoing shortage, the Ally X is going to be much more susceptible to the pricing volatility.</p> <p>Asus <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">was one of the first PC gaming manufacturers</a> to tell its partners at the start of 2026 that some prices would be going up as AI “hyperscaler” companies race to acquire available memory supply to build out data centers. At the time, nothing was mentioned specifically about the Xbox Ally X handhelds. While it’s unclear just how many Asus has sold, it promised consumers late last year that it <a href="https://www.asus.com/event/Investor/Content/attachment_en/2025Q3%20IR.pdf">was ramping up production</a> to meet higher demand than originally expected.</p>

 <p>A similar issue is facing every other hardware manufacturer in the gaming space. Valve already delayed announcing the price of the Steam Machine as it evaluates the rapidly changing economic conditions, and its existing Steam Deck, a much cheaper competitor to the Xbox Ally X, has quickly become impossible to buy. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">launch of the PS6</a>, Nintendo is looking at having to hike the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a>, and god help you if your PC is at the end of its life and you need to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">buy or build a new one</a>.</p>

<p>ArtPlay and Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement’s creative director, Shutaro Ida, has passed away at 52 from cancer. </p>



<p>Announced through the official <a href="https://x.com/ArtplayEN/status/2023213425707647237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) account of ArtPlay, their creative director, Shutaro Ida, passed away on February 10, 2026, after a one-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. Shutaro has been a significant figure in the gaming industry, not only in ArtPlay games but also in popular franchises such as Metal Gear Solid and Castlevania. </p>







<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-be-completed-to-shutaro-s-legacy-and-vision">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement be Completed to Shutaro’s Legacy and Vision</h2>



<p>The last project on which ArtPlay’s creative director was working was Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Shutaro was leading this project, and it has now entered its final stages. The development studio has promised to “carry forward his legacy and strive with all our strength to complete this work worthy of his vision and name.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is a 2.5D metroidvania title, set in 16th-century England. It features a gothic atmosphere with strategic battles, crafting, and exploration. The game features a new buddy system for the series, allowing players to play as both Leo and Alex to battle Demon Lord Elias’s reign of terror. </p>



<p>The title also features the series’s largest map yet, with a day-and-night cycle that includes dawn, day, dusk, and night. Players can learn new and powerful abilities as they progress, plus there is also a lot of crafting and cooking, along with customisation that can change the players’ attributes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shutaro Ida has passed away aged 52 after a one-and-a-half year battle against pancreatic cancer. The news was announced by his family via a statement on Ida’s <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account</u></a> on February 15. Longtime colleague Koji Igarashi has vowed to finish the designer and director’s upcoming metroidvania Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement, the sequel to 2019’s Castlevania-infused Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shutaro Ida (sometimes romanized as Shutaro Iida) worked at Konami from 1996 to 2015, mainly as a programmer. His biggest contribution was to the Castlevania series. Starting with the GBA title Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and PS2 game Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, Ida played a key role in bringing the gothic action games into the sixth and seventh console generations, even directing Castlevania: Harmony of Despair on Xbox 360 and PS3. He was also a lead programmer on Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon the invitation of former Castlevania series producer Koji “Iga” Igarashi, Ida joined ArtPlay, the indie dev company Igarashi co-founded. There, Ida designed and directed the crowdfunded game Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, with Igarashi as producer. The game was well-received, and widely seen as a spiritual successor to the Castlevania series. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/25/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-review"><u>review</u></a>, we gave it 8.8, noting it “plays and feels almost exactly like the legendary Castlevania: Symphony of the Night.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting upon two decades of making games with Ida, Igarashi noted in his <a href="https://x.com/KojiIGA/status/2023210325970129391?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tribute:</u></a> “I’ve been working with him ever since Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow. It’s not an exaggeration to say that many games hailed as masterpieces would not have succeeded without his contributions. His talent was exceptional.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel that Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night’s success was also in a large part down to his incredible support," Igarashi continued. "Looking back, he’s been supporting me for over 20 years. He was the kind of person who always thought about games, tackling game development like he was burning his life away. I hope he can rest peacefully now as he was always running at full throttle.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ida’s final game, Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is still in development and is due out later this year. Igarashi described it as an invaluable work that Ida poured himself into. “We will take on his aspirations for the game and see that it is properly completed, so as not to disappoint him.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ida last <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2017126464664281512?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> back on January 30, saying that he felt the end was near as he was getting weaker each day. He finished with a simple request: “Please love Bloodstained 2 and all the games I made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/CurryHermit/status/2023200658544083439?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> from Ida’s family echoed this sentiment: “Shutaro’s adventures in this world have come to an end, but his creations remain. We would be happy if people could continue to enjoy the games he made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/3X_54wp1xiU?si=XHJYvYoBLUVQIPsl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement YouTube channel</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

"I think if someone deleted my 100% save file with everything unlocked and every piece of clothing bought, camp completed, map and journal drawings all there, dreamcatchers murals bones exotics and cards, a shout out from Roger Clark might heal the pain," said one fan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">IGN's big interview with Roger Clark on Arthur Morgan and Red Dead Redemption 2</a> to find out just how life-changing the iconic role was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Red Dead Redemption 2 fans recently made progress towards solving the game's newly-discovered spiderweb mystery, and now believe they've reached its final clue following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers"><u>major new discovery within Rockstar's epic cowboy sequel, dubbed the biggest uncovering of hidden content in years</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An intricately-placed breadcrumb trail of spiderwebs was found and plotted, leading to a further set of marked telegraph poles.
