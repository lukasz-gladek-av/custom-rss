<p>Activision has just revealed that DreamHack Dallas will serve as the staging ground for the Call of Duty League Major IV tournament. This grand event will unravel between May 23 – 25 at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the team has confirmed that DH Dallas will play host to a Challengers Open. This is great news for those competing in the tier <strong>below </strong>the Call of Duty League, as the Challengers circuit has felt a little overlooked in recent months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-first">Major First</h2>



<p>In a statement posted on the Call of Duty blog, Daniel Tsay, the GM of COD Esports at Activision, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re excited to bring Major IV to DreamHack for the first time in Call of Duty League history.</p>



<p>An event at DreamHack will allow our fans to enjoy this iconic celebration of gaming and esports, and also provide new fans the experience of competitive Call of Duty live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans are excited to see the return of Challengers Opens through 2025. Presently, three have been lined up for the year ahead, with the first one taking place at Major II in Texas. The only CDL Major this year to <strong>not </strong>have any Challengers events will be the upcoming Major I, set to take place next week in Madrid.</p>



<p>Every <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/news/2025-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Challengers Open event</a> will go hand-in-hand with a $100,000 prize pool, with $40,000 being reserved for the first-place team.</p>



<p>This season is one of many firsts in the CDL. Not only do we have the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history, but we now have the first CDL Major to take place at a DreamHack event.</p>



<p>If you’re not in the know, DreamHack represents one of the most well-known and prolific gaming and esports ecosystems in the world. This historic event dates back to 1994, and in the last 30 years, it has travelled the world and played host to many top-tier tournaments.</p>



<p>Last year, the Overwatch Champions Series World Finals event was held at DreamHack Stockholm.</p>

      <div><p>Steamforged Games recently launched their crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-brings-complex-ww2-grand-strategy-to-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game</a> Gamefound. The tabletop adaptation of Paradox Interactive's beloved military strategy game has completely overtaken its funding goal, reaching it 13 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/hearts-of-iron-board-game?refcode=v1JUB3G5fUmqA6iMaMS28g#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game allows players to re-enact major events during World War II. Two to five players can take on the role of the Allies or Axis powers. Players must manage resources, make political alliances, and keep their nation stable while maintaining political and military strength.</p>

<p>At the end of 2022, VALORANT’s biggest star and hottest free agent was Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker. Arguably the best player during pro VALORANT’s Chamber meta, yay converted his electric season with OpTic Gaming, which included a trophy at Masters Reykjavík, into <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/cloud9-set-to-sign-valorant-star-yay-from-optic-gaming-report-says-1943658/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major deal with Cloud9</a> at the start of the partnership era.</p>



<p>What followed yay’s terrific tenure with OpTic was a two year odyssey of setbacks and losing. Yay was dropped from Cloud9 after two matches, with the organization citing “role issues.” Yay played seven matches with Disguised, a tier two NA VALORANT team owned by streamer Disguised Toast, losing all seven matches. He then went across the world to BLEED Esports in the VCT Pacific league, winning just one match in eight matches played.</p>



<p>Yay now finds himself on Evil Geniuses, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a place where every player ends up not by choice,” according to the team’s world champion coach Christine “potter” Chi</a>. After EG defeated FURIA at the VCT 2025 Americas Kickoff, yay’s first win in the Americas league ever, the reborn VALORANT star spoke to Insider Gaming about his new agent pool, his “back” status, and how he’s grown during his tumultuous journey.</p>



<hr>



<p>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Astra isn’t really an agent that utilizes the Operator very much, but you couldn’t tell by watching your performance today. Do you feel like the best version of yourself is the one that has the Op in your hands?</strong></p>



<p>I would say…yes and no? That’s tough to be honest. I would say my rifle is almost equally as good as my Op. That’s one of my strengths as a player throughout my whole career: I’m able to do both very well. I feel like I can pick up anything to be honest with you.</p>



<p>The Operator is really strong on Abyss in general, and [using it with Astra] is something that potter recommended. Since I’m able to place smokes from anywhere on the map, it’s good to have it in my hands so we can let Icy entry, and then I can just hold anything.</p>



<p><strong>IG: This is the question that everyone has been asking: is yay back?</strong></p>



<p>[Laughs] I would say not yet, but I think as we continue to progress as a team and I continue to work on certain things, I will fully regrow that confidence. This was a big step; getting another win on the board.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the highest level of “back” you think you can reach? Are we talking OpTic yay?</strong></p>



<p>That was a very unique situation in which I was on Chamber for an extended period. I like to believe I [still] have a very high ceiling that extends well beyond Chamber and that whole meta, but I think I need to build more confidence with that. You won’t see the same yay, but you’ll hopefully see something similar [with] a new style. And hopefully some championships as well.</p>

<p><strong>IG: What do you want to accomplish this year?</strong></p>



<p>I would really like to make another international event, at bare minimum. And rebuild a lot of the self confidence I used to have. I think I’m pretty much there, but now it’s about proving it to myself at this point.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You’ve mentioned getting your confidence back a few times now. How badly did those two years away mess with you, personally and on the server?</strong></p>



<p>It was a pretty rough period. It’s a very hard feeling to describe to someone, because you go from the very peak [of VALORANT] to not being able to flat out win anything. It’s something that throughout my entire pro career, even extending back to other games, I’ve never experienced before in my life. To go from such high highs to low lows in such a short time frame, it takes a toll on you, and I’m not gonna pretend that it didn’t.</p>



<p>But I think I’ve done a pretty good job of figuring out and working through that, and I’m excited for the future.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Is that experience something you’re trying to learn from, or one that rather just forget about entirely?</strong></p>



<p>You take what you can from that situation. There’s some things I learned in terms of just being a better human being. Like not relying so much on the results of what’s going on around. For a long period, what defined me was VALORANT, and when results aren’t going well, you feel very bad about yourself.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the most important thing you’ve learned on this big journey?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve learned how to deal with expectations. I put a lot of stock into what the community or what other people thought of me. I’ve learned to realize that what the outside world thinks of you doesn’t really reflect who you are. It’s [more] important to realize what’s important to you and what you stand for. And if I do need to fix something or change I have people I can rely on for that.</p>

                <p>Not every player can experience video games in the same way, especially if they have impairments. That's why Ubisoft is laying out the accessibility options that are included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which may open some doors for players who might otherwise feel excluded. </p><p>One of the key additions to Shadows is that the cinematics will have audio descriptions available, which will be a first for the series.

"This shows how far we've come along in the last few years, in terms of people being aware of and caring about accessibility at Ubisoft. I am proud to see this evolution, awareness, and care spreading and making our games more accessible every time."</p><p>Some of the other accessibility features utilized in Shadows include colorblind options, HUD customization, improved subtitles, the ability to simplify or skip QTEs, and screen narration for menu items and HUD modules.</p><p>Additionally, Ubisoft has revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">there will be an expansion for Shadows</a>, which is going to be a pre-order bonus rather than a standard DLC.

<section><p>Xbox's latest Developer Direct highlights what makes the company's showcases stand out: its developers.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Long before I was a Games Journalist™ and thus required to watch just about every video game showcase, conference, and direct for my job, I was an eager video game fan doing the exact same thing but without, you know, a professional obligation. Regardless of whether these events required me to rise well before the sun (looking at you, Nintendo), for well over a decade I've been there, buzzing with excitement and ready to preorder things I certainly did not need.</p><p dir="ltr">Chances are that if you're reading this, you too enjoy watching these events. Though you'd be correct in calling what's shown at these conferences glorified commercials, I've often thought of it as us gamers getting our own little "Super Bowl commercial celebration" every month or so, which is pretty neat if you ask me.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the years of partaking in these often-solo watch parties, I've come to associate and expect certain things from certain studios and publishers. Devolver will always offer up a somewhat convoluted but high-value production that leans into the absurd, while Wholesome Direct pairs pastels with short-and-sweet sizzle reels, giving each one of the many indie games it's highlighting a brief time to shine. Of the "big three" video game companies--PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo--Nintendo was the first, in my eyes, to really cultivate a strong, public facing identity. If it ever does away with its quirky voiceovers and charming segues, I'd be heartbroken, to say the least.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation, I'd then argue, was the second. When PlayStation comes to play, you know you are getting far more action than talk. Though its State of Plays <em>might </em>feature someone in a suit saying a few words between trailers, the company largely does not indulge in bells and whistles. Instead, you get trailer after trailer, with the company's narrative-heavy prize jewels getting ample screentime. I get this approach and admire it: Sometimes we really should just let the games speak for themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">And that leaves us with Xbox. In more ways than one, Xbox has struggled with an identity problem for years. Is it the catalog of first-person shooters and multiplayer titles that makes it appealing? Should we see it more as a home entertainment ecosystem? Is it the fact that the console now allows you to play in a variety of ways--including not on the actual consoles--that sets it apart? Does the company's greater emphasis on accessibility make it the best way to play? <em>Is </em>Game Pass truly the best value in gaming and a major selling point?</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, this isn't a dig at Xbox. I think it's wondrous to be ambitious, well-rounded, and ever-changing--the current media and entertainment landscape demands it. But for a while, this led to the company not having a very clear identity. However, Xbox's latest Developer Direct got me thinking about how far the company has come and how, over the past few years, it's made great strides towards establishing a much-welcomed identity.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, Xbox has been all about one thing in particular: the developers. Some of this, of course, has manifested in ways that I don't particularly love, as both Xbox <em>and </em>PlayStation have been quick to identify and acquire seemingly any studio willing to sell. But whereas PlayStation outwardly focuses more on the games and franchises they are acquiring, Xbox feels quicker to highlight the studios and teams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703"></a><figcaption>A still of Hazel from South of Midnight</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/">January 2025 Developer Direct</a>, Xbox spent close to an hour highlighting just five games: Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, South of Midnight, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-an-action-packed-slick-new-turn-based-rpg-revealed-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6524081/" data-ref-id="1100-6524081">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The company provided plenty of gameplay, allowing unfamiliar but interested audience members a chance to see what they were about, and kept the time spent on each game remarkably equal, despite certain titles having more mainstream awareness. But even more compelling to me was how they gave the studios behind these games ample time to actually talk about themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who is all about dark fantasy and gothic vibes, getting to hear the team behind South of Midnight wax poetic about these topics, and express their reverence for the American Deep South's folklore, was delightful. Though Clair Obscura's turn-based combat lends itself to JRPG comparisons, it was interesting to hear that the team's decision to structure its RPG as such was born out of a deep attachment to the genre and their longing to make something that combined it with their own sensibilities and culture. And id Software--the studio behind Doom--focused on the company's legacy and how they are incorporating the series' staples, such as fast-paced action and metal music, alongside additions like new medieval-style weapons and the ability to control a mech. Lastly, as someone who, for some wild reason, has yet to play the Ninja Gaiden series, I appreciated hearing the developers explain the game's world and what pairing up with Platinum Games means for Team Ninja.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has said time and time again that it is focused on supporting developers it acquires, not assimilating them into its own ecosystem and way of play. Unfortunately, we have seen the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">not always stick to this</a>, as it shuttered Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games just last year--it would frankly be disingenuous to not point this out and express my disappointment in this. However, this showcase still means a great deal to me and makes me hopeful that these closures will happen less and less going forward: that they will learn how to properly support studios and prevent what even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reacts-to-redfalls-bad-reviews-explained-what-went-wrong/1100-6513812/">Phil Spencer noted</a> was a failure on the company's part to properly aid developers in executing their vision.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of why this is so important to me right now is because I firmly believe we are dealing with a large-scale dehumanization crisis. I recently saw <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexaray.bsky.social/post/3lgbksuapq22k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a BlueSky post</a> that really resonated with me, that essentially said that, because games are becoming increasingly affiliated with the tech sector, they are being treated in a more capitalistic way rather than as art. It's plain to see, with one example of this being how many studios are instructed to follow certain trends--such as live-service games--rather than play to the strength of the developer.</p><p dir="ltr">Games are growing larger, more jam-packed, and more technologically impressive than ever before. But are we willing to sacrifice artistic vision and personality for that? This, alongside the push for greater AI usage in ways more ethically questionable than ever before, has me feeling that, in spite of certain game's grand scale and presentation, we are somewhat regressing. When developers are being laid off left and right, and when those who remain's voices feel silenced while others accept accolades off-screen, I can't help but be irked by the way the people who make games are all too often forgotten or dismissed.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox is by no means a perfect company. To be clear, none of these companies are. However, I do have admiration for the way it is tackling its showcases with more humanity and emphasis on developers. It is a trend I hope other studios, big and small, follow, lest we lose the innovation, humanity, and magic that makes my favorite hobby so incredibly special.</p>

That’s roughly eight heroes a year, and that means <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ roster could be nearly twice the size it is now in just a few short years. How does NetEase plan to do that? </p><p>Well, from the looks of it, the studio has dozens already in the pipeline. Leakers and dataminers have been reporting that file names already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ code reference several characters who are likely in the works.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite the continued rise of VALORANT and the post-release energy surrounding Counter-Strike 2, the most watched esport in the world is still League of Legends, and it’s not really that close. The MOBA that serves as Riot Games’ foundation nearly doubled the amount of total hours watched from the second most watched title of 2024.</p>



<hr>







<p>According to <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-games-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> from Esports Charts, fans watched 749.6 million hours of League of Legends esports events in 2024, up 27% from the year before. The 2024 World Championships, known commonly as Worlds 2024, unsurprisingly was the biggest event of the year. Worlds 2024 accumulated over 190 million hours watched, accounting for over a quarter of League esports hours watched all year. The event peaked during its grand finals, with a record 6,856,769 viewers tuning in to watch <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-2024-winner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T1 and the legendary Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok win their fifth Worlds event</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Trailing behind League of Legends is the mobile-based MOBA, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, which is wildly popular in Southeast Asia. In third place is Counter-Strike 2, followed by VALORANT, and then Dota 2 in fifth place. 2024 represents the first time that VALORANT has surpassed Dota 2 in total hours watched. While the Dota 2 scene suffered due to the discontinuing of the Dota Pro Circuit, VALORANT continued to grow internationally.</p>



<p>Esports Charts’ data doesn’t track viewership from Chinese livestreaming platforms though, due to “the unreliability of the reported statistics and lack of transparency in regards to how they are calculated.” But it’s clear that China is a massive priority for the top performing games. VALORANT expanded with the VCT China League in 2024, and also saw the first Chinese team, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edward-gaming-wins-valorant-champions-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EDward Gaming, win its world championship</a>. For the first time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history, a Major was held in Shanghai, where <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Spirit lifted the trophy</a>.</p>

The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review"><u>PlayStation 5</u></a> and the more powerful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> are built for stunning graphics and ultra-smooth gameplay, and to fully experience that, you need an HDMI cable that can handle all that power. Fortunately, there are some great options out there that will ensure you're getting the best possible performance from your console in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – These Are the Best HDMI Cables for PS5:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 supports 8K@60Hz or 4K@120Hz, so you’ll want to choose an HDMI cable that’s designed to support the latest features of the PS5, including 4K resolution at 120Hz and even 8K resolution for future-proofing. Whichever cable you go for, upgrading to a high-quality HDMI cable can really enhance your gaming experience on the PS5. Clearer visuals, smoother gameplay, and reliable performance –  what’s not to love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While an improved connection is a great start, you'll also want to upgrade to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tvs-for-ps5">good PS5 TV</a> or one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-monitor-for-ps5">best monitors for the PS5</a> to get the best possible experience.</p><p id="best-overall"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best overall" id="powera">1.

Yes, it comes with a premium price tag, but if you want the best of the best, you’ll have to part with a bit of cash. Supporting HDMI 2.1, this HDMI cable can output 4K@120Hz, and even 8K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Matching the console’s simple, clean, and white aesthetics, the PowerA Ultra High Speed HDMI Cable is durable, minimalist, and sports gold-plated connectors. And, at 10-feet long, you’ll have plenty of wiggle room between your console and your display should you need it.</p></div><p id="best-high-speed"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best high-speed" id="belkinhigh">2.

With HDMI 2.1, the cable can handle speeds of up to 48Gbps, more than your PS5 or PS5 Pro will ever output. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With slim profile connectors, this HDMI cable fits nicely into the back of your PS5 and your TV. Everything here is high quality. Knowing you can game in 4K@120Hz with a compatible display, or watch videos in 8K@60Hz warrants the higher price tag. It's likely you'll even be able to use this for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-6">PlayStation 6</a> when it eventually arrives, making this a worthwhile long-term investment.</p></div><p id="best-angled"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best angled" id="ugreenangle">3.

Enter the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable. Instead of taking a risk and bending your HDMI cable, why not invest in a right-angle cable from the offset?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You do sacrifice a few things with this cable, however. For instance, it’s much shorter than many HDMI cables at only 3.3 feet. This might be fine for some people, but you should double check how much cable you need to connect your PS5 to your TV first. There’s also the fact that it only supports HDMI 2.0, so you won’t be able to enjoy the 120Hz refresh rate the PS5 is designed to be capable of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, if you need a right-angle cable at a very affordable price, the Ugreen Right Angle HDMI Cable is your best bet.</p></div><p id="cheapest"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheapest" id="basics">4.

The Amazon Basics HDMI Cable does what it says on the box – there are no fancy features, braided cable, or right angles – it costs a little over $6 and is capable of speeds of up to 48Gbps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the length could pose a problem to some users, this HDMI cable is also available in 6-foot and 10-foot options. It’s incredibly affordable and can easily be a suitable replacement for the included HDMI cable you get with the PS5 if you have lost it, broken it, or need a spare.</p></div><p id="best-everyday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best everyday" id="anker8k">5.

Since it’s HDMI 2.1, you could use it to connect your monitor to your PC, too, should you need to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are definitely more affordable HDMI cables available, if you want a solid cable that’s going to last a long time, Anker’s is a no-brainer. The only thing you might want to do is spend a little more and get a slightly longer 6-foot or 10-foot cable.</p></div><p id="best-premium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best premium" id="cablebraided">6.

With lots of marketing jargon, it’s easy to get lost and spend over and above for what you actually need. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 can output 4K@120Hz; HDMI 2.1 is the standard that supports this, so if you have a TV capable of this resolution, you should look for a HDMI 2.1 cable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re on a tight budget, don’t have a compatible TV, or just need a spare, then you could get away with a HDMI 2.0 cable – but this can only reach 4K@60Hz.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, though, for around the same price, it’s not hard to find a suitable HDMI 2.1 cable. You just need to assess the distance between your PS5 and TV, ensuring you invest in a cable that gives you plenty of room. This is especially true of you don't have a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-stand">good TV stand</a> that has holes in the back for cords to slip through,</p><p id="faq"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="FAQ">PS5-compatible HDMI Cables FAQ</h2></p><h3 data-cy="title3">Are expensive HDMI cables worth it?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have a modern 4K or 8K TV, you shouldn’t get sticker shock when looking for an HDMI cable. At these high resolutions, the amount of data the PS5 is pushing to your PC is massive, and cheaper cables run the risk of corrupting that data by using lackluster materials. However, if you’re playing your PS5 on an older display, you might want to consider either upgrading your TV, or opting for a cheaper HDMI cable.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What kind of HDMI cable does the PS5 use?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To get the most out of your PS5, you should use a HDMI 2.1 cable. This supports 4K@120Hz, or 8K@60Hz, providing the best gaming experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Does the PS5 come with a HDMI 2.1 cable?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the PS5 does come with a HDMI 2.1 cable. You don’t need to buy any additional cables unless you want a longer cable, one with features like braiding, or you need a spare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is HDMI 2.1 backward compatible?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, HDMI 2.1 is backward compatible. If you plug a HDMI 2.1 cable into a HDMI 2.0 port, it will still work. If you plug a HDMI 2.0 cable into your PS5, it will still work, but it won’t offer support for the same video output.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kegan is an avid gamer who has been playing games since his Atari days.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351191/ayaneo-3-price-release-date-indiegogo-specs-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Ayaneo builds the best-looking handheld PCs in the business, but they’ve always been boutique. The 2023 Ayaneo 2, for example, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23604799/ayaneo-2-review-handheld-gaming-pc">cost $1,300 for an arguably worse experience than the $400 Steam Deck</a>. But that experience isn’t dampening my excitement for the new 7-inch Ayaneo 3. </p></div><p>Not only does this one start at $900, within striking distance of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">highest-end handhelds you’ll find at retail</a>, it’s the most feature-packed portable I’ve seen — with two USB4 ports <em>and</em> OcuLink <em>and</em> RGB-ringed Hall effect joysticks <em>and </em>your choice of two seemingly killer screens. Perhaps most exciting: a way to finally fix a handheld’s joystick and button layout to match your ergonomic preferences!</p><p>Just watch:</p><div><figcaption><em>Finally.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Animation by Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Ayaneo is calling the Ayaneo 3 “the world’s first modular handheld,” because there’ll be other modular options too. An extra $139 buys a set of six modules that let you swap out your joysticks for analog sticks, a six-button microswitch pad for fighting games, or even D-pads and face buttons with conductive silicone underneath for a different feel. </p><div><figcaption><em>Six modules and extra joystick toppers come with the “Magic Module” kit.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>But importantly, that basic module that lets you change joystick and button orientation and swap joystick caps comes with the handheld by default, and it’s not the only feature Ayaneo is impressively cramming into the $900 kit. </p><p>While you’ll “only” get a Ryzen 8840U, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and 512GB of storage that that price — no <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 option</a>, and the HX 370 model starts at $1500 — you do get your choice of OLED or IPS right away. </p><p>That OLED screen is a 1080p 144Hz HDR OLED panel promising 800 nits of global brightness and 110 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, specs which suggest it could even beat the Steam Deck OLED’s excellent screen.</p><div><figcaption><em>An actual photo of the Ayaneo 3.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ayaneo</cite></p></div><p>Like the Deck OLED, it unfortunately <em>doesn’t</em> have variable refresh rate for added smoothness — but if that’s important, the IPS panel option does! That one’s a 120Hz, 500-nit, native landscape 1080p display, according to the company, with 7ms response time and only 100 percent sRGB coverage (read: nowhere near as colorful as the OLED panel). </p><p>On top of all that, the Ayaneo 3 comes standard with both top <em>and</em> bottom USB4 ports, both of which are capable of 65W PD charging, <em>plus</em> the still-rare-on-handhelds Oculink port <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24319196/egpus-continue-to-evolve">for eGPUs</a>, and it takes full-length M.2 2280 SSDs for easy storage upgrades.</p><p>Plus, there’s a dedicated hardware mode switch on the bottom edge to switch the controller and virtual-mouse-and-keyboard modes. I doubt that will make up for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">the current state of Windows</a>, but it could help! Also, new trigger locks for its Hall effect triggers, if you want to switch them into a hair trigger mode.</p><p>I do have a few hesitations, even without having touched the Ayaneo 3. First, the company says its modules <em>electronically</em> latch into the frame — you have to eject them by pressing a software button, which activates a motor to release the latch. Sounds potentially fiddly?</p><p>Second, I’m sorry to report that this 1.5-pound handheld only fits a 49 watt-hour battery, even though the Asus ROG Ally X manages to fit an 80 watt-hour pack into roughly the same weight. Fingers crossed, but I wouldn’t expect great battery life here with neither a giant battery pack nor a particularly handheld-optimized chip.</p><p>Lastly, it’s always important to point out that these products are crowdfunded, and while Ayaneo has a history of delivering its promised handhelds, they haven’t always been great — and this is the most ambitious one yet. If that sounds worthwhile, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ayaneo-3-the-world-s-first-modular-handheld">you can find the Ayaneo 3 on Indiegogo</a> here. </p><p>The company says the handheld should ship at the end of April; here’s the whole price breakdown.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t feel bad if you missed that news, because <em>Star Trek: Section 31</em> has been barely marketed and isn’t in a theater near you. Instead, this spin-off film starring Michelle Yeoh is a streaming-only movie exclusively available on Paramount+. </p><p>The movie sees Yeoh reprising her role as the evil mirror universe version of Philippa Georgiou from <em>Star Trek Discovery</em>. However, Georgiou is now working with the Federation and its secretive group known as Section 31. She forms a team, does some sci-fi mission, and the horrible movie that you shouldn’t watch ends with her and the team sharing drinks together. That’s when the team’s leader, Control, appears via hologram and we get a big last minute cameo. </p><p><strong><em>Stop right now if you are still planning on watching this movie and don’t want the ending cameo spoiled!

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is coming out in February.

It’s a shorter list that positions the new update as one of the smaller in recent memory, but that doesn’t mean it won’t keep players locked in for the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans often show up for the FPS gameplay and stick around for the guns, so the Gunblade already feels right at home. This two-in-one rifle doubles as both a ranged weapon and a giant blade. Using both to catch your opponents off guard may prove useful in the heat of battle, especially on the new Rivals Bridge map. This suspended, concrete location leaves no room for small talk by putting players into close-quarters combat from the jump with only a few concrete walls and a bus standing in between them. Nosniy says the arena is located in Seoul and comes from creator @GreatGuyBoom.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/22/roblox-rivals-update-9-1737584645781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Rivals Update 9 adds the Gunblade to the Roblox FPS experience's arsenal.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, fans will notice that the Rivals Update 9 patch notes don’t mention any specific bug fixes, balance changes, or quality-of-life additions. The developers acknowledge their decision to ditch any other tweaks in favor of adding the Bridge map and Gunblade. Although there was room to “slightly” modify the skins for the Demon Shorty and Demon Uzi while renaming a few other weapons, Nosniy does promise more to come with the next major content update. Among the new additions will be one long-awaited feature: Ranked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hear all of your feedback and want to reassure you all that every necessary &amp; additional changes/improvements will be made in time for Ranked,” the team said in a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rivals fans have enjoyed regular updates since launch arrived last May. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rivals-update-7-patch-notes-outline-plans-for-weekly-weapon-drops"><u>Update 7</u></a>, for example, brought along the introduction of the Energy Rifle, Energy Pistols, Crossbow, and more.

However, the developers have confirmed what the game is not, and that is a "cosmic horror in feudal Japan." Executive Michal Nowakowski <a href="https://x.com/michalnowakow/status/1758597188555591758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said previously on social media</a>, "It's definitely NOT a cosmic horror in feudal Japan."</p><p>Given that Project Hadar is a new IP, it stands to reason it will take place in a new, original universe featuring brand-new characters. The word "Hadar" has <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/hadar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many definitions</a>, including a fossil site in Ethiopia and a star in the Centaurus constellation, but there is no telling if however the word may be defined is in any way associated with what the product might be when it's done.</p><p>CD Projekt developer Maria Mazu told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-studio-dev-thinks-it-only-makes-sense-for-cd-projekt-red-to-make-a-new-ip-that-comes-straight-from-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that they were "so happy" to learn they would get to make a new IP. "I feel like it only makes sense given how many kinds of people we have on this, like the storytelling side of things but also our artists," Mazur said. "It feels like a waste not to invest all that into something new or something that comes straight from us. I am very excited about Hadar."</p><h2 id="Project_Hadar_game_engine">Project Hadar game engine</h2><p>Project Hadar is likely to be developed with Epic's Unreal Engine, though this is not confirmed. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4</a>, and it would make sense for the deal to cover CD Projekt's other games. But again, this is not confirmed.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_Project_Hadar_">Who's developing Project Hadar?</h2><p>CD Projekt is developing Project Hadar. As of October 31, 2024--which is when the latest data was published--CD Projekt said it had 18 people working on Project Hadar. This was actually down from 20 people at the end of July 2024. As you can see in the chart below, the overwhelming majority of CD Projekt's developers are working on Polaris, which is the codename for The Witcher 4.</p><p>CD Projekt has evolved in recent years to become a bigger studio that is making multiple games simultaneously. In addition to Hadar and The Witcher 4, CD Projekt's teams are working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-witcher-game-project-sirius-is-undergoing-some-changes/1100-6512512/" data-ref-id="1100-6512512">Witcher spin-off called Sirius. </a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498" data-ratio="0.56085918854415" data-width="838" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4433498"></a><figcaption>Only a small number of CD Projekt developers are working on Hadar right now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4433498-screenshot2025-01-24at1.55.44pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Project_Hadar_development_news">Project Hadar development news</h2><p>CD Projekt <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1577317922460024834" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced Project Hadar in October 2022.</a> At the time, the studio said the game was "created from scratch" and was, at the time, in the "earliest stages of the creative process." At the time, the studio made it clear that it was not developing an actual game yet, but instead putting together the "foundation" for a game.</p><p>No one should expect Project Hadar to be released anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is the studio's current main focus, and it just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">entered full production at the end of 2024.</a></p><p>CD Projekt making a new IP is a major development for the studio, as the company is best known for its adaptations of other creator's works. The Witcher is based on Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, while Cyberpunk 2077 is based on Mike Pondsmith's role-playing game.</p>

On top of all the other mechanics and features, this ends up being a lot of information to remember. It’s a bit of an abrupt surprise for a game that otherwise bills itself as being chill and cozy. There is no need to worry though! We’ve got you covered with a breakdown of every currency in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> along with their uses and how to get them.</p><h2 id="h170033"><a id="bling"></a>Bling</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-recommend-id="image://9c3e7441d7e881f0d56f4baeca4152de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nikki points toward a pair of floating Bling on a rooftop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bling is the only currency that <em>technically</em> isn’t related to any gacha banners. It can be used on the Surprise-O-Matic, which is a separate gacha mechanic that’s accessible pretty early on. Bling can be used to purchase items and materials from merchants you encounter in-game. Upgrading outfits and Heart of Infinity nodes are also dependent on it.</p><p>Bling will be the currency you accumulate the most in terms of quantity. While everything else will be gathered in the hundreds and thousands, you’ll be able to surpass millions of Bling eventually. But in-game items and such do get pretty expensive, so it works out. . And don’t be surprised if you need to farm for some more Bling in the endgame.</p><p>In addition to quest rewards, Bling can be found all over the open world. You’re bound to find a lot simply by going out and exploring. Exchanging materials for some in the Realm of Escalation will be the go-to strategy for you later on.</p><h2 id="h170034"><a id="diamond"></a>Diamond</h2><figure id="" data-id="e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-recommend-id="image://e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-recommend-id="image://e650a4ce77bdad8b19ac01f65b4ced61" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Diamond tab on the store, showing the options to use them toward Resonite Crystals and Revelation Crystals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps the most important out of all the currencies, <strong>Diamond is used to purchase both Resonite and Revelation Crystals, which are needed to pull on the permanent and limited-time banners respectively.</strong> They can also be used for refilling Vital Energy, but I recommend trying to use them for Revelations Crystals only.</p><p>You won’t find Diamonds just laying around out in the wild, but there are many ways to earn a tiny amount here and there. Activating Warp Spires and opening chests will give you a nice amount early on. Play some more and you’ll receive them for leveling up, completing quests, and completing various challenges. No matter if you’re a F2P user or someone with a wallet at the ready, these are always worth getting more of.</p><h2 id="h170035"><a id="stellarite"></a>Stellarite</h2><figure id="" data-id="9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-recommend-id="image://9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-recommend-id="image://9d3d52370957b9dfe1a9b5ebac4d613e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Stellarite tab on the store, showing the various bundles ranging from $0.99 to $99.99." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Stellarite is the sole premium currency in <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, meaning you have to spend real money to obtain these.</strong> They can then be applied directly toward special outfits or some feature packs with HP recovery items. The more common use is to convert them into Diamonds with a one-to-one ratio. Although you can’t use your real money directly for the gacha banner pulls, there are only a couple of currencies you need to transfer around to do just that.</p><p>Remember that Stellarite is only obtainable with real money. You shouldn’t hold out hope that they’ll offer these in events or through special redeemable codes. The next couple of currencies are what you might see pop up in those situations.</p><h2 id="h170036"><a id="resonite"></a>Resonite Crystal</h2><figure id="" data-id="5267e90c77485655c93caf54f448fa47" data-recommend-id="image://5267e90c77485655c93caf54f448fa47" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The permanent Distant Sea banner that requires Resonite Crystals.

It highlights four distinct looks for Nikki." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em>’s primary gacha banners are pulled by spending two types of crystals. <strong>Resonite Crystals are used specifically for the permanent Distant Sea banner.</strong> The outfits you can get here won’t be leaving, so you don’t need to feel too urgent when it comes to pulling for this banner.</p><p>Your primary method for obtaining these crystals is by trading in other currencies, namely Diamonds, Surging Ebb, and Tranquility Droplets. You can also earn some here and there by raising your Stylist Rank, Mira level, or by progressing through the free track of the Mira Journey battle pass. Pay attention to any upcoming events since those can give some out as rewards too.</p><h2 id="h170037"><a id="revelation"></a>Revelation Crystal</h2><figure id="" data-id="e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-recommend-id="image://e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The limited-time Blooming Fantasy banner that requires Revelation Crystals. It highlights a fairy look and another that’s carrying a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The limited-time Blooming Fantasy banner that requires Revelation Crystals. It highlights a fairy look and another that’s carrying a camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-recommend-id="image://e167f4a0c5a635269d902b9ae9348bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The limited-time Blooming Fantasy banner that requires Revelation Crystals. It highlights a fairy look and another that’s carrying a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the second and arguably more valuable crystal. <strong>Revelation Crystals are used to pull in the limited-time banners.</strong> Just like any other gacha, the idea will be to get as many of these as possible before using them all to hopefully get the item you want.</p><p>There will be temporary codes to redeem and the occasional mail reward offering some Revelation Crystals. Otherwise, you can get them by exchanging with other currencies or through the paid track of Mira Journey. If you’re looking to exchange but aren’t sure which crystals to go for, I recommend focusing on Revelation Crystals. The fact that these are only used for time-limited banners inherently makes them more valuable.</p><p>On a related note, you might also be wondering what the Limited-Time Revelation Crystals that come with events are. <strong>Limited-Time Revelation Crystals work the same way as the regular ones, but they’ll expire at the end of the current banner.</strong> This isn’t a common mechanic among gachas, although one of the developer’s previous works had this function. I suggest using these up before they expire. Even if the banner doesn’t interest you, it’s better to use them to get some new items than let them waste. </p><h2 id="h170038"><a id=""></a>Tranquility Droplets</h2><figure id="" data-id="a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-recommend-id="image://a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tranquility Droplets tab in the store. It shows numerous items with a monthly limit, including Crystals and Bling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Tranquility Droplets tab in the store. It shows numerous items with a monthly limit, including Crystals and Bling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-recommend-id="image://a0a188b296ba90ec5f934a669c92995a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Tranquility Droplets tab in the store. It shows numerous items with a monthly limit, including Crystals and Bling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Whenever you pull from a banner and get a duplicate three-star outfit piece, you’ll receive Tranquility Droplets instead.</strong> They have their own tab in the Resonance store filled with materials and potions to buy. The catch is that every item on that tab has a monthly limit you can purchase. That being said, the best things to buy with them are Resonite or Revelation Crystals. </p><h2 id="h170039"><a id=""></a>Surging Ebb</h2><figure id="" data-id="5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-recommend-id="image://5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surging Ebb tab in the store. Its first seven items, including Crystals, have no limit attached to them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Surging Ebb tab in the store. Its first seven items, including Crystals, have no limit attached to them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-recommend-id="image://5858e709305523064a6b381c00b118a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Surging Ebb tab in the store. Its first seven items, including Crystals, have no limit attached to them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This currency works similarly to the previous one. <strong>Whenever you pull from a banner and get a duplicate four-star or five-star outfit piece, you’ll receive Surging Ebb.</strong> These also have a Resonance store tab, but with some different items and a handful of them not having a limit. Yes, you can trade these in for a limitless amount of Crystals. Just don’t expect to see this currency too often. Four-star and five-star outfit pieces are rarer to pull, and therefore rarer to get duplicates of.</p><hr><p>For as cozy as <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is, you’ll still feel like a gacha accountant with all these different currencies. The good news is that there isn’t crazy combat or metas to keep up with in this game. You can take it at your own pace and just vibe with all the Fresh and Elegant clothes acquired during your journey. Play the game and grind for the stuff you want, but make sure to take some time to just ride some bikes and look cute doing it.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Daredevil (Charlie Cox) still looks menacingly cool in the cel-shaded animation, Doctor Strange still has that ancient mystical aura about him, and Scorpion looks less like a lizard man and more like a mercenary in a protective suit with a tail. All around, the cast of characters has our fanboy senses tingling. </p><p>Trammell also says the show will have “different takes on classic characters,” before showing off a few that really push the show outside the margins of Marvel canon. We first see a blonde woman wearing a laser-shooting helmet that bears more than a passing resemblance to the head of infamous Spider-Man foe Rhino, which could imply she’s a variation on the character in this continuity. The most surprising new addition, however, comes near the end of the video when what looks like a version of Venom appears, with claws, horns coming out of its head, and a hairy back very reminiscent of Sabertooth’s. Remember, executive producer Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-disney-1851738403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-disney-1851738403">made it publicly known</a></span> that a moment happens in this series that breaks its story away from the MCU canon timeline. These different character variations could definitely be the show’s way of driving that point home. </p><p>With fan favorites being remixed, and early fan reactions of the show being overwhelmingly positive, it’s only a matter of time before the series debuts on January 29 and becomes our latest obsession. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Four years after its launch, US sales of Xbox Series X/S are trailing behind those of its predecessor, Xbox One, at the same point in the consoles' life time. Sales of PlayStation 5, however, are now firmly outpacing PlayStation 4.
</p>
<p>
That's according to sales data from marketing research and technology company Circana (formerly The NPD Group) in its latest monthly report. Circana executive director and games industry analyst Mat Piscatella summarised the company's finding  - covering US games and hardware spending up to December 2024 - in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">lengthy post</a> on Bluesky (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/us-ps5-sales-are-pacing-ahead-of-ps4-while-xbox-series-lags-behind-xbox-one/">VGC</a>).
</p>
<p>
Commenting on some of the reports highlights, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f">wrote</a>, "Through each console's first 50 months in the US market (life to date ending Dec 2024 for both Xbox Series X/S and PS5), PS5 lifetime unit sales are 7 percent ahead of PS4's pace, while Xbox Series X/S trails Xbox One by 18 percent." By comparison, Piscatella noted, "Through 38 months in the US (through Dec 2023), PS5 led PS4 by 6 percent while Xbox Series X/S trailed Xbox One by 13 percent."

<p>
Circana's 2024 end-of-year report charts what Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2dpa7su2n">called</a> a "rough" 12 months for gaming hardware, with consumer spending falling 29 percent compared to last year. On a more granular level, spending on PS5 hardware fell by 18 percent (although it remained the best-selling platform in December) while Series X/S and Switch declined by 38 percent. This drop, however, was "expected" according to Piscatella, given Switch's substantial time on the market, and PS5 and Series X/S both being "past their selling peaks".
</p><p>
While specific hardware sales figures weren't disclosed, Sony last year revealed, amid declining year-on-year sales, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">61m PS5s have been shifted</a> since its launch in November 2020. Microsoft does not share sales figures for Xbox Series X/S, but it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">also previously confirmed declining hardware sales</a> as it increasingly pushes Xbox as a hardware agnostic brand.
</p>
<p>
Piscatella's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2ddgpqc2n">full summary of Circana's latest report on US games and hardware trends</a> can be found on Bluesky and makes for an interesting read.

One is very functional and will make certain gameplay elements easier, while the other is all about overhauling the look of your outfits. So let’s dive into how to upgrade your threads to explore new heights of style.</p><h2 id="h9816"><a id="glow"></a>Glow-Up</h2><figure id="" data-id="390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-recommend-id="image://390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-recommend-id="image://390642dd3d9916641a080a9f56243be6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Glow-Up upgrade screen for Nikki’s Bubbly Voyage Ability Outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>One way to upgrade clothing in <em>Infinity Nikki</em> is with a Glow Up, which will improve its stats.</strong> A piece’s best stat will see the most improvement, so you can rest assured that your Elegant hair will come out with a much higher Elegant stat. The primary reason to interact with this mechanic is to increase how many points your clothing scores during Styling Challenges.</p><p>Each Glow Up will require a certain amount of Bling, Threads of Purity, and Shiny Bubbles. The amount needed for each will increase each time you go through with an upgrade. Furthermore, a piece’s rarity will also affect how many resources are required.</p><h2 id="h9817"><a id="evolution"></a>Evolution</h2><figure id="" data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Infold Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-recommend-id="image://d0788b47e52289dfc8dd7b2ba7954400" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Clothing Evolution screen with the Bubbly Voyage: Spring outfit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Another method of upgrading is called Evolution, and its sole purpose is to unlock a recolor of an outfit.</strong> There isn’t a gameplay advantage for doing this as stats remain the same as the original look. Any 4-star outfit will only have a single recolor to evolve into, but those with a 5-star rarity have three.</p><p>The requirements to go through an Evolution are dependent on a few factors. Ability Outfits you craft during the main quest line need the following:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>A duplicate of each item that makes the outfit</li><li>Bling</li><li>Threads of Purity</li><li>Calm Thoughts</li></ul><p>Any Ability Outfits you acquire from a banner can also evolve, but they’ll just need a duplicate set. That might sound easy at first, however, you’ll need to get these duplicate items from the banners as well. Time and a little bit of luck will be necessary to get enough of the items. Don’t be surprised if you’re suddenly tempted to fork over a bit of cash to get crystals and make more pulls on the banner.</p><p><strong>Outfits with a 5-star rarity are the most difficult to evolve.</strong> They can go through the process a total of three times, with only the final recolor requiring a set of duplicates. The first two evolutions will instead require a Heartshine to unlock the new duds. Heartshines are solely unlocked through the Deep Echoes mechanic of each banner, which rewards you with items for making various amounts of pulls. You can look forward to getting them after making around 180 pulls. Additionally, Heartshines are unique to each banner. If you complete a 5-star outfit and then decide to go for their evolved versions, you’ll need to grind out or pay for a lot of crystals.</p><hr><p><br><em>Infinity Nikki</em> can be downright overwhelming with its many systems, especially if you’re new to Gachas. Hopefully you have a better understanding of how to upgrade outfits so you can ace those Styling Challenges and look damn good while doing mundane activities. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a surprise reveal that came alongside confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-at-microsofts-xbox-developer-direct-2025">Microsoft is set to publish Ninja Gaiden 4</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S (including Game Pass day one) later in 2025. For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time"><u>considered one of the greatest action games of all time</u></a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The Tomb features a fan-favorite Wonder Weapon, which deals elemental damage and provides an additional way to heal downed teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the Citadelle des Morts final cutscene, Gabriel Krafft tells the crew to take the amulet they've acquired to an excavation site in France. As seen in the trailer below, the crew finds itself at the dig site, which features underground tombs and a subterranean temple.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlvFuhlYRMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tlvFuhlYRMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay for The Tomb shows off all these various layers of the map, and it gives us an even better look at the map's Wonder Weapon in action. The Tomb features the Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon, which is familiar to those who played the popular Origins map from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Staff of Ice is capable of firing icy blasts at enemies, slowing or freezing them in place, as well as dealing a more devastating area-of-effect attack. It also has the ability to heal, and the trailer shows a crew member using the Wonder Weapon to fire a restorative blast to revive a downed teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Origins is one of the most beloved Zombies maps of all time, and while this is only one of the four elemental staffs featured in the original Black Ops 2 map, it's really nice to see the staff return after all these years. Plus, having another way to heal teammates is always a bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 also adds the Death Perception perk from Black Ops 4, and augments will be available to unlock to upgrade the perk. Three more Gobblegums are introduced, including one Whimsical Gobblegum that dresses all the zombies with rubber ducky flotation devices.</p><p dir="ltr">All the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-roadmap-details-terminator-event-new-mp-maps-and-warzone-improvements/2900-6155/#1">highlights of Season 2's content can be found here</a>, which includes brand-new multiplayer maps, a Terminator crossover event, and ninja-themed operators.</p>
