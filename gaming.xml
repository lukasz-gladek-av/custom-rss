Initially, at least, it resulted in a wave of positive comments from fans.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🛠️Attention, Raiders!<br>We've just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:<br>• Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch<br>• Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch<br>• Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update<br>• Fixed an… <a href="https://t.co/xv0k1dIQ1t" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xv0k1dIQ1t</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Say what you want about embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t6g0y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user commented</u></a>, “but this was QUICK!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Dude I was literally in firing range, tried it (successfully), went back to Speranza to grab a bobcat and give it a 100 round mag in practice range, and it just stopped working,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r1zvfy/comment/o4t953g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Insane work Embark, I didn't even restart my client.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders has suffered from those looking to take advantage of dupe exploits since its launch in October, and Embark has played whac-a-mole with cheaters and exploiters since. This was the case earlier this week, when the Stockholm-based studio launched <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-pve-focused-event-and-new-rewards-as-embark-squashes-duplication-bug-in-new-update"><u>an update</u></a> fixing the latest dupe glitch only to find reports of a new one cropping up shortly after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an annoyance for players, who are often forced to confront Raiders who have earned their items and in-game currency through illegitimate means, and it’s apparently keeping Embark up at night, too. As players – and even popular streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/theburntpeanut/clip/KnottyFineSwallowSaltBae-7izWpIHRKvqiEVO6?filter=clips&amp;range=24hr&amp;sort=time" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheBurntPeanut</u></a> – began showcasing examples of the latest glitches, the developer launched the new hotfix, bringing adjustments just one day after its last patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to fixing the inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch and infinite ammo weapon glitch, the update tackles two bugs related to quests. Embark says it is “dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits” in Arc Raiders and will “keep you in the loop” regarding future issues. The problem is, these issues are already here, with what appears to be hundreds of players already taking to various Arc Raiders social media accounts to share that they’ve been impacted by a new problem.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨BREAKING 🚨 Since today's hotfix to fix the infinite ammo glitch, there are many reports of Raiders losing their loot when they extract. Be careful out there!</p><p>🎥u/hellfire13 <a href="https://t.co/zyO56MAydV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zyO56MAydV</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders PVP (@ArcRaidersPVP) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersPVP/status/2021659705484226879?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Reports related to a separate glitch, which seemingly robs players of their topside inventory when extracting, appeared moments after today’s hotfix went live. It’s unclear if this is an ongoing issue or if the lost loot bug is only affecting those who were mid-raid while the hotfix was published. The confusion has been enough to see fans directly ask Embark for their loot to be returned, while others worry a new topside run could result in them losing their gear, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Embark,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/since_the_infinite_ammo_hotfix_players_are_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>player said</u></a>, “come on guys.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Damn, they fix one thing and break something else entirely,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r20hlf/comment/o4tekrs/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>. “Good lookin out!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how the Embark team plans to handle the latest Arc Raiders glitch. For now, at least, it seems some of its community managers are working with fans to determine the cause.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Arc Raiders team can’t catch a break, at least when it comes to cheaters and exploits. Since laying out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters">a plan to deal with widespread reports of cheaters</a> last month, the studio has done its best to keep players coming back with frequent gameplay adjustments, new content, and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-promises-a-new-map-more-arcs-and-even-a-little-love-for-scrappy-by-april-2026"><u>four-month roadmap</u></a>. Its post-launch plan currently has it sitting in the middle of its Headwinds update, with its next chapter, Shrouded Sky, set to bring a new map condition, a new Arc threat, and more later this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>our interview with Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund</u></a>, where we talked about the past, present, and future of Arc Raiders.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment tied a bow on its Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight after showing off how the Warlock class will take over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-ii-resurrected">Diablo 2: Resurrected</a> in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40-minute presentation came to a close after giving fans a sneak peek at a dungeon’s worth of updates across its three Diablo pillars. Highlights include the reveal that the Warlock is coming to Diablo 4 and Immortal in April and June, respectively, and it’s out for Diablo 2: Resurrected with The Reign of the Warlock DLC right now. While new content definitely stole the show, the Blizzard team still made sure to offer deep dives into some of the quality-of-life updates players have been expecting, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re looking to learn more about the Lord of Hatred expansion or revisit a beloved early 2000s action RPG, we’ve gathered all of the highlights from today’s show. You can see everything announced at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The Warlock Class Is Coming to Diablo 4, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Players expected the Warlock to come to Diablo 4, but they didn't expect this. In addition to Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred, the Warlock is coming to Diablo Immortal and, yes, even Diablo 2: Resurrected. It's an unexpected update that brings the class to all three of today's games, with the full spotlight detailing how each offers different playstyles for different kinds of action RPG fans.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Is Summoning the Reign of the Warlock for Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021721334435205162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s 2021 reimagining might be a mostly faithful remake of a classic game, but that doesn’t mean it can’t add to it. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of the franchise, Diablo 2: Resurrected is getting a new expansion called Reign of the Warlock – and it’s out today for PC (including Steam), PlayStation, and Xbox for $24.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The content adds the demon-summoning Warlock as an all-new class not present in the original experience. It allows players to summon, bind, and devour demons, shaking up the Diablo 2 formula for the first time in 25 years.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blizzard Talks Terror Zones in Diablo 2</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Reign of the Warlock comes a few tweaks to Terror Zones. Specifically, players can now be stalked by hunters called Heralds of Terror when playing on Hell difficulty. Terrorized bosses beaten on the same difficulty mode also now unveil statues, with players encouraged to combine five of them to access new endgame bosses called the Colossal Ancients.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Quality-of-Life Adjustments Add Loot Filers, Advanced Stash Tabs, and More to Diablo 2: Resurrected</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The new quality of life changes in Reign of the Warlock give you sharper tools for even the darkest of journeys. <a href="https://t.co/yOWzcZ9my6" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yOWzcZ9my6</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021717067406487856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, time for what most fans expected when they heard Diablo 2: Resurrected would be featured at the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight: quality-of-life changes. Blizzard now allows players to create, share, and check out community loot filters, all without the use of mods. The update also comes with the ability to stack stash items alongside the addition of dedicated tabs for materials, gems, and runes. Finally, The Chronicle is an item tracker for players who like their Diablo experience to be nice and organized.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">A First Look at the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-warlock-1770852504435.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Warlock Class. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This June, Blizzard is bringing the Warlock to Diablo Immortal. This version of the summoning class utilizes demon skull, a sacrificial blade, and a beast known as the Soulgorger. The Warlock will get her own origin quest explaining her backstory at an unspecified point in the future.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lut Gholein Joins the Warlock in Diablo Immortal</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That previously teased location coming to Diablo Immortal is none other than Lut Gholein. Players will find the iconic location has been split between its Common Ward and High Ward districts, with Blizzard explaining that it pulled inspiration from real-world Moroccan cities when bringing it back to life.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Return of the Demon Queen Andariel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo Immortal's next "big bad" is the Maidan of Anguish, Andariel. She's sporting a new look, too, with associate art director Emil Salim describing her as "domineering, equal parts regal, and sadistic," adding that "she's driven by nothing less than a desire for dark godhood."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diablo Immortal Roadmap Sets Fire to 2026</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/11/diablo-immortal-roadmap-1770852022171.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Diablo Immortal Roadmap 2026. Image courtesy of Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo Immortal team has big plans for 2026. A roadmap shared during the 30th Anniversary Spotlight showed off just a few of the updates players can expect in the coming months, with some examples including a new battleground event and updates to classic zones. Expect a new subzone, along with new monsters and bounties, every quarter, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yes, the Second Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred Class is the Warlock</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the leaks and rumors weren’t enough to give it away, the Warlock is officially confirmed to join the Paladin when Lord of Hatred launches for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox April 28. Blizzard plans to share more about the new Diablo 4 class during a developer update that’s set to take place March 5.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lord of Hatred Is More Than Just a Class Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight gave fans a first look at how Lord of Hatred expands on Diablo 4 with Skovos and its many mountains and temples. Today’s presentation focuses on Temis, the location’s capital city and an area that holds more information about the Askari, the Prime Evils, and the origins of Santuary.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Skill Trees and the Talisman System</h2><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Forge a brand new path through Sanctuary with the all-new skill tree system coming to Diablo IV: Lord of Hatred 🌳 <a href="https://t.co/UBMf4gX5wl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UBMf4gX5wl</a></p>— Diablo (@Diablo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/2021718519596097808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Major changes are coming to Diablo 4, regardless of whether you choose to pick up Lord of Hatred. Referring to a running joke that has seen players calling the game’s skill trees “skill twigs,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian unveiled a closer look at the skill tree rework launching with the expansion this April.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Blizzard team says it’s about giving players “meaningful choices and options” from the get-go, calling it a “major disruption to the current class system.” One example shown during the presentation highlights the Sorcerer’s Hydra skill, which players can fine-tune to increase attack speed, launch explosions, and even use frost projectiles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Talisman, meanwhile, is a new itemization system with Lord of Hatred that brings back charms and sets. Footage of the foundational update teases more ways for players to customize their builds to their playstyle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">“They’re going to freak out…”</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Game director Brent Gibson closed out the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight with a tease of what’s to come. In a tongue-in-cheek moment just before the event reached its conclusion, Gibson says, “Oh, my god. They’re going to freak out at BlizzCon when we announce—.” There’s no telling what exactly Diablo fans have to look forward to, but it at least sounds like Blizzard has plans to pull back the curtain when BlizzCon takes place September 12 - 13.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

<p>Unfortunate news coming out of Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Alex Graner, Senior level designer for Highguard, revealed in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?datePosted=%22past-24h%22&amp;keywords=Wildlight&amp;sid=~Hb">LinkedIn </a>that he, “along with most of the team at Wildlight,” was laid off on February 11.</p>



<p>Notably, he says there was a lot of unreleased content that he and the team had designed for the game, which he was looking forward to sharing with the public.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-bumpy-road-for-highguard">The Bumpy Road for Highguard</h2>



<p>Highguard launched on January 26 and received mostly negative reviews on Steam from the outset. They continued to push forward with updates, including new modes and events, but less than a month later, news broke of massive layoffs.</p>



<p>The game was launched with big hype as the final announcement from the 2025 Game Awards ceremony. However, there was virtual radio silence following that event until the game’s launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-layoffs-becoming-more-common-in-the-gaming-space">Layoffs Becoming More Common in the Gaming Space</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, mass layoffs are becoming a trend in the gaming industry. Ubisoft recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of multiple projects, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>



<p>Wildgate also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wildgate-developer-moonshot-confirms-layoffs/" id="171549">recently announced</a> layoffs. As did <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-downsizing-2xko-team-focus-shifts-to-core-improvements/" id="175347">Riot Games.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Wildlight for comment. We will update the story as new information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Developer Wildlight Entertainment released its free-to-play raid shooter, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/highguard">Highguard</a>, last month, on January 26, to mixed results. Now, just a few weeks after the game's launch, most of the team has reportedly been laid off. That's according to former Highguard level designer Alex Graner, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/">who posted on LinkedIn today</a>, stating, "Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today."&nbsp;</p><p>In Graner's post, he says this layoff "really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard." If we take his words literally, it sounds like that content might never be released, which would be shocking but not unprecedented in this industry, which has been under constant disruption due to layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Highguard has been climbing a steep hill since <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/new-fantasy-shooter-highguard-announced-from-former-titanfall-devs">its reveal as the final "world premiere" at The Game Awards 2025</a> back in December. Its reveal didn't go over well with audiences, likely due to its placement as the closing spot during the awards ceremony and its difficult-to-parse style of FPS. Nonetheless, Wildlight released the game for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on January 26.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Game Informer </em>Editor-in-Chief Matt Miller called it a promising contender in his <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/highguard/promising-contender">Highguard review</a>.

              <p>Wildlight Entertainment, the studio behind the new not-hero shooter&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a>, has reportedly laid off “most” of its team just weeks after the game launched on January 26.</p> <p>Level designer Alex Graner posted about the news on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7427480816940892161/?originTrackingId=%2FqMD4ALWpJvcsmxWmoXMGw%3D%3D">LinkedIn account</a>, saying he’s looking for whatever’s next after he and an unknown number of his fellow employees have been let go. <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>has reached out to Wildlight for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <blockquote><p>Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.</p> <p>This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>However, I’m excited for my next adventure. If your team or anyone you know needs an experienced Level Designer, hit me up!</p></blockquote> <p><em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>was announced in December during the 2025 Game Awards, and it <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088">didn’t go over very well with some sides of the internet</a>. Then the team at Wildlight went <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-breaks-radio-silence-and-the-internet-reacts-2000662650">radio silent for weeks</a> until the game finally launched at the end of January and press and content creators <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136">got hands-on time</a> with the game. The response to the final game was a bit lukewarm, though Wildlight was quick to respond to feedback about the game’s small 3v3 team compositions by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-surprise-5v5-mode-is-sticking-around-but-its-not-enough-2000665423">adding a 5v5 mode</a> within the first week.</p>

 <p>Though the game seemed to struggle in terms of concurrent players, director and studio head Chad Grenier said in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/highguard-wildlight-interactive-interview/"><em>Polygon</em></a> that the team was less concerned with player counts than it was with making something its player base enjoyed. “Whether it gets a thousand people or a hundred million people, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “What matters most is that the game is loved by the people who played it.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816</link>
            <guid>1433014</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard is bringing a new class to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-is-mostly-just-diablo-ii-for-be-1847741744"><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected</span></i></a><span> for the first time ever, giving players a new way to make their way through the nearly 26-year-old RPG for the first time in decades with the </span><i><span>Reign of the Warlock </span></i><span>add-on launching today, February 11. It’s a big swing for the remaster, as it toes the line between preserving the original experience and creating something entirely new. The team is aware that some might view it as sacrilegious, so it isn’t making this change lightly.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on the Blizzard Irvine campus last month that</span><i><span> Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, game producer Matthew Cederquist and game designer Tim Vasconcellos talked about adding to the legacy of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-ii-resurrected-dev-folks-deciding-if-theyll-buy-1847702995"><i><span>Diablo II</span></i></a><span> and whether or not the Warlock is the last addition fans can expect. It sounds like the Warlock was one of a handful of classes in discussion, but it wasn’t the only one.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We started with maybe, I don’t know, three or four [classes] that were top of mind,” Cederquist said. “But then we kind of shopped that around to the team, and the team was most excited about two specifically out of those, but then we thought, ‘All right, we’re gonna rock out the Warlock just because the team was so excited about it.’ They’re like, ‘oh yeah, we can make this amazing.’”</span></p> <p><span>While they wouldn’t say what the runner-up class was, Vasconcellos says the Warlock’s summon-based blend of melee and ranged functionality lets it take up some unfilled space in </span><i><span>Diablo II</span></i><span>’s line-up. But still, the team worries about “painting over the Mona Lisa,” so to speak. They wanted to find ways to make the Warlock feel like a natural fit, as if it had always been in the game, and the devil is in the details.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We looked at the warlock and said, ‘Okay, so what would make this feel as if we were coming out of </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> and this is a class that would have launched with </span><i><span>Diablo 2?’</span></i><span>” Vasconcellos said.&nbsp; So you’ll find references […] Did you notice the </span><i><span>Diablo I</span></i><span> icons in the skill tree? Subtle hints like that try to make it feel familiar, as well as something that’s new still in the game. How it’s expressed and what space do you actually have to develop in that are all things that we’ve tried to consider, and we’re eager to hear from the community of whether or not we actually accomplished our design goal.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Blizzard reiterated during the interviews that the people working on </span><i><span>Diablo II: Resurrected </span></i><span>are longtime players who still play the game to this day and want anything new they bring to the package to be additive, but whether or not the studio keeps doing this will depend on whether or not players take to it. Although the team said they would like for this to not just be a one-off marking the series’ 30th anniversary, they had nothing further to announce at this time.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During today’s Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight event, Blizzard announced the series’ newest class is the Warlock, and it’s coming to Diablo II: Resurrected, Diablo Immortal, and Diablo IV — each game featuring a unique interpretation of the demon-wielding archetype. While the Diablo team is holding back details of the Warlock’s class identity in Diablo IV’s Lord of Hatred expansion and Diablo Immortal, it is bringing the new character to Diablo II: Resurrected today via the new Reign of the Warlock DLC.&nbsp;</p><p>Diablo II’s rendition of the Warlock can summon three demons: the Tainted, the Defiler, and the Goatman. The class can also bind (read: tame) themself to almost any demon in the game, benefiting from its unique abilities. Additionally, the Warlock may choose to devour the bound demon, granting themself temporary buffs based on the consumed demon.&nbsp;</p><h2>Watch the Diablo 30th Anniversary Spotlight:</h2><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnAsWN-6hvw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KnAsWN-6hvw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“From the very get-go, it feels like such a natural extension of Diablo to have a character like the Warlock,” associate game director Zaven Haroutunian tells me. “From a narrative perspective, Necromancers [...] are all about maintaining a balance. They’re almost neutral in tone and in how they think. [...] Warlocks, however, are more ostentatious [...] they’re very loud with all the things they do.”</p><p>“Mechanically, they’re actually very different from Necromancers, which are all about building up an army,” Haroutunian continues. “The Warlock doesn’t do that. [...] All the stuff he’s bringing in is disposable. He doesn’t actually care about them. They are just his tools, right?”</p>

<p>When asked how the disparate teams are differentiating the class’s abilities across three games (while still maintaining a unified theme), Haroutunian tells me that each team did whatever it needed to to make the Warlock fit their game. The associate game director likens the process to the creation of Diablo IV’s recent Paladin class and how his team distinguished it from Diablo II’s standard.</p><p>Diablo II: Reign of the Warlock is available now on&nbsp;<a href="http://battle.net/">Battle.net</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/news/2026/02/11/diablos-new-class-is-the-warlock-and-its-coming-to-diablo-ii-resurrected-today]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The dataminers were right, there is a warlock class coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, as part of the The Lord of Hatred expansion that arrives in April. I played it at Blizzard a couple of weeks ago, and although I can't tell you in detail about it yet, I can say it's the dark complement to the light-bringing paladin class that's also in Lord of Hatred - the yin to its yang, if you like.</p>
<p>But there are more reasons to be excited about the warlock. One, it's a brand new class for the Diablo series, meaning the warlock has never appeared in any previous games. But two, and this is the show-stopping bit, it's coming to two other Diablo games as well: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-immortal">Diablo Immortal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-ii">Diablo 2</a> Resurrected. To emphasise the show-stopping bit there: this is the first new character class Diablo 2 has had in 25 years, and it's being released today in a paid Reign of the Warlock expansion for the game. It costs $25.</p>
<p>The warlock's arrival in Diablo 2: Resurrected begins a new era for the game whereby it will progress beyond its classic state with additional ongoing development. There will effectively be two instances of the game, one known as Diablo 2: Resurrected, the time-locked classical version of the game, and a second modern version called Reign of the Warlock, which will push the game on. Is that a dangerous road to walk? Yes, but as Blizzard told a group of press I was in, "We don't want to mess up the Mona Lisa." I will write more about this in a subsequent article. </p>

<p>Blizzard announced the warlock triple-drop in a Diablo Spotlight video today. The other notable major Diablo 4 announcements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fishing mechanic,</li>
<li>A skill-tree overhaul, which significantly expands what's there by adding new skills and potential for customisation</li>
<li>A new endgame pursuit called War Plans, whereby you can make bespoke lists of activities you want to do, modify them, and earn rewards for carrying them out. To me it seems like an evolution of Adventure Mode - a new pursuit to keep you busy once the game's campaigns are done</li>
<li>A "hyper-rare" event called Echoing Hatred, which throws infinite waves of enemies at you and gives you loot depending on how long you survived</li>
<li>The Horadric Cube, which lets you combine materials and items</li>
<li>Loot filters</li>
<li>And the return of Charms and Sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Diablo 4: Lord of Hatred launches 28th April on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The other notable Diablo 2 announcements are: Enhanced Terror Zones for the game, and new quality of life features including much-desired loot filters, advanced stash tabs, and a loot-tracking database called the Chronicle, which notes everything you've found and where you found it, thank god.

</p><p>Each of the three games' warlock interpretations are different, by the way, tailored to their various gameplay styles. Diablo 2's is perhaps the most fiddly - I have played it too - particularly in the demon taming skill tree, which lets you dominate demons you face and either use them like pets or consume them for power. It's another layer of micro-management.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the best-known names in game development are in Las Vegas this week for the annual DICE Summit and one of the first orders of business is <a href="https://kotaku.com/vince-zampella-death-car-crash-tributes-reactions-2000655379">paying tribute to the late Vince Zampella</a>. “His legacy isn’t just in the franchises or awards,” EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/vince-zampella-dice-tribute">an on-the-ground report by <em>Game File</em></a>. “It lives in every studio that chooses trust over fear, craft over shortcuts, people over ego.”</p> <p>Bethesda’s Todd Howard, <em>Metal Gear</em> creator Hideo Kojima, and others appeared via pre-recorded video segments to share memories of and tributes to the man who helped shape and shepherd some of the biggest studios and franchises in gaming. “Vince was the real deal,” Howard said.&nbsp;“I would always seek his advice with every game that I did, or how to maneuver on all that is going on in the industry.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">At DICE, Hideo Kojima revealed that he had many discussions with Vince Zampella about creating a first person Metal Gear Solid game together after the release of Metal Gear Solid 4. <a href="https://t.co/hhjbCqG7T2">pic.twitter.com/hhjbCqG7T2</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Zampella died tragically and unexpectedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-vince-zampella-battlefield-boss-and-call-of-duty-co-creator-killed-in-car-crash-2000655216">in a car crash last December</a> that also claimed the life of his passenger. He worked on <em>Medal of Honor</em> in the early 2000s before cofounding Infinity Ward to lead<em> Call of Duty</em>. He later cofounded a new studio, Respawn Entertainment, amid an acrimonious split with Activision over studio bonuses. At the time of his death he had become an executive president at EA overseeing <em>Battlefield</em> and other franchises.</p> <h2>The first-person <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> that wasn’t</h2> <p>Kojima, who had his own messy split with publisher Konami back in the 2010s, said Zampella took him on a tour of Respawn while he was in the process of getting <em>Death Stranding</em> maker Kojima Productions off the ground. “He gave me a lot of support and advice,” Kojima said, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/vince-zampella-dice-tribute">according to <em>Game File</em></a>. “He showed me his studio, and I incorporated some of the good aspects into our own studio.”</p>

 <p>Kojima <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2021671381382181056">even revealed</a> that the two had at one pointed talked about possibly collaborating on a first-person <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> shooter sometime after <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> was released in 2008. Howard added that he’d previously nominated Zampella for a lifetime achievement award, but he’d refused to accept the honor.</p>

              <p><span>One of the best ways to get someone into a hero shooter is to compare a character they don’t know to one they have intimate knowledge with. I haven’t played a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-campaign-master-chief-release-date-2000651439"><i><span>Halo </span></i><span>game</span></a><span> in over a decade, so I didn’t clock that Emre, one of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new heroes</span></a><span>, feels a lot like Master Chief from Bungie’s classic shooters. But some friends I was playing with last night made the comparison, and then I woke up this morning to find the internet is </span><a href="https://x.com/bentoDRAWS/status/2021347046469533930?s=20"><span>running wild with it</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very nice of them to add a Halo guy to Overwatch <a href="https://t.co/3IKSLenHXQ">pic.twitter.com/3IKSLenHXQ</a></p> <p>— bento (comms open!!) (@bentoDRAWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/bentoDRAWS/status/2021347046469533930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Emre is definitely cut from the Soldier: 76 cloth in that his kit is one of the more straightforward shooter movesets in the game. He’s got a three-round burst rifle on which he can aim down sights without losing any of his movement speed, a side arm that fires explosive rounds and makes him run fast, and an ultimate that lets him fly and rain fire down on his enemies. But he also has frag grenades that bounce around just like Master Chief’s do in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, and both those and his rifle seem to be immediately activating long-dormant muscle memory for those who haven’t played as Microsoft’s mascot for a bit.</span></p>

   <p><span>If you upgrade his perks accordingly, Emre’s grenade can also stick to enemies, much like the plasma grenades from </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, so the comparisons just keep coming. If you were considering getting into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>after its soft reboot</span></a><span> this week and don’t know who to pick first, Emre might be an easy place to start. There are 50 heroes now with varying degrees of complexity, and starting with more simple heroes is a good way to acclimate yourself to all the chaos. Just don’t panic when you see </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>a flying cat</span></a><span> carrying a giant German man with a hammer over the battlefield.</span></p>

The publisher and distributor announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2673080/view/491590284956666227?l=english">Steam</a> (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mema6bshls25">Wario64</a>) earlier today.</p>
<p>From <strong>31st March 2026</strong>, you'll no longer be able to purchase the game digitally. However, if you already own it (physically or digitally) or buy it before 31st March, you'll be able to redownload and play it at any point.</p>
<p>No reason for the delisting was given, but it's likely due to licensing rights expiring, similar to what happened with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bill_and_teds_excellent_retro_collection">Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/bill-and-teds-excellent-retro-collection-is-about-to-be-delisted-on-the-switch-eshop">a few years back</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ugykhw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's Limited Run Games' statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to give you an early heads-up that the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection will no longer be available for purchase on digital storefronts after March 31, 2026.</p>
<p>If you already purchased the game, don’t worry — you’ll still be able to redownload and play it anytime.</p>
<p>In the past, we learned how important it is to provide plenty of notice for changes like this, so we’re committed to being as open and transparent as possible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to give fans every opportunity to grab the game before it’s too late. Thanks for understanding!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jurassic Park: Classic Games Collection came to Switch on 22nd November 2023, so by the time it gets removed from the eShop, it'll have only been out for around two years and four months. The games included are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic Park (NES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (SNES)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (Game Boy)</li>
<li>Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition (Genesis / Mega Drive)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the Collection perhaps <em>isn't</em> the best showing for the iconic dinosaur franchise, but it's a time capsule of 8 - and 16-bit games made in the wake of the 1993 movie's huge success. We acknowledged this as much in our review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection">scoring the selection a 6/10</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ubisoft developers are striking outside the company’s Paris offices this week. Over 1,200 of them, according to union reps. They’re dancing, too, as they call on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> maker to reverse its controversial return-to-office policy and call for <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">accountability from its top executives</a>, including co-founder Yves Guillemot.</p> <p>“At this stage, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees,” Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris Marc Rutschlé <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring">told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>.&nbsp;“The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year.”</p>

 <p>On February 10, the first day of the this week’s strike, speakers were blaring the 2014 Game Boy chiptune banger “<a href="https://soundcloud.com/kenobit/kenobit-disco-sanwa-2014">Disco Sanwa” by Kenobit</a>. Developers danced even in the rain while protesting the direction of the company.</p>   <p>The three-day strike this week includes developers at Ubisoft Milan as well and comes after the French publisher announced a new emergency pivot that included delaying some big games and cancelling many others. In addition to a fresh cost-cutting program that amounts to another 200 layoffs, and annual raises that have shrunk during hard times, Ubisoft is calling for employees to go back to being in the office full-time by the end of 2026.</p>

 <p>That message, delivered by CEO Yves Guillemot in an internal email and recent townhall meetings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">has gone over like a lead balloon</a>, not least of all because of the person who’s delivering it. Despite saying the company needs to change and evolve, Guillemot and his brothers, who founded it back in the 1980s, remain in charge thanks in part to a $1 billion bailout by Tencent.</p>

 <p>One employee in Canada <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-montreal-lead-fired-david-michaud-cromp-work-from-home-linkedin-2000665081">was fired for the way he criticized the new policies</a> in work channels, which Ubisoft said violated the company’s code of conduct. Unlike France, Ubisoft’s major Canadian studios in Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto are not unionized. Ubisoft’s smaller mobile gaming team in Canada briefly unionized earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">but was subsequently shut down</a>. The company said the closure had nothing to do with the labor organizing.</p> <p>Unions <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stjv.fr/post/3mejkg2umyl2q">blamed this week’s walkout</a> on the “arbitrary decision of the CEO who doesn’t even dare talking to employees anymore.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, the god-simulator from Fable creator Peter Molyneux, launches on April 22, and ahead of the game's PC release, developer 22 Cans has released nearly seven minutes of all-new gameplay in an extended trailer. The game, which puts players in control of a god-like hand to master real-time strategy, town management, and simulation, also lets players become one of their villages' many NPCs to explore, fight, explore dungeons, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a taste of all that and more in the new trailer, and you can check it out below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y_Jph0SH_l4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"Masters of Albion is a bold reimagining of the God Game genre, from the creator who defined it," the trailer's description reads. "Revel in the freedom of true Godhood. In Masters of Albion, there is no single solution. Build whatever, wherever. Hire whoever, wherever. Kill or carry, crush or coax. You are the ultimate power."&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, Masters of Albion will be Molyneux's final game, as he and 22 Cans said <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?si=wgxWrMJrTAOFcIlB&amp;v=CSLGKKAuZwo&amp;feature=youtu.be">when the team announced it during Gamescom 2024</a>. Molyneux, who is the mind behind Populous and Black and White, as well as Fable (the original), said Masters of Albion is "the culmination of my life's work" back when the game was first announced.&nbsp;</p>
