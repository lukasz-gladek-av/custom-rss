Nintendo has released a new trailer highlighting some of the new powers she’ll have and all the places she’ll get to use them. </p><p>Princess Zelda will have the whole of Hyrule to explore in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. She’ll traverse the harsh landscape of the Gerudo Desert, the calming waters of Jabul, the jungles of the Faron Wetlands, and the scorching lava floes of Eldin Volcano. And to get around the wide world of Hyrule, Zelda will be able to summon a trusty steed to her side, just like Link.</p><p>Zelda’s got a couple of new powers that will aid her in her quest to save Hyrule from dangerous rifts that threaten to consume the land. In addition to being able to summon copies of creatures or objects called echoes, she’ll also be able to bind or reverse bond objects. With the bind power, Zelda will tie an object to her movement, letting her move giant obstacles or enemies out of her way. For reverse bond, Zelda herself will move along with the object, helping her get over big gaps or climb tall cliffs.</p><p>It’s a little more than a month before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out for Nintendo Switch owners. With the reveal of these new locations and powers, it seems like <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> will have an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22959702/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-open-world-five-year-anniversary">open-world vibe</a> similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-updates-possibly-tease-october-filming-toy-bonnie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As spotted <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/horror-movies/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-starts-filming-in-october-matthew-lillard-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by GamesRadar</a>, film actor Matthew Lillard gave fans a major update during a new interview, teasing that filming on the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 movie could begin in October 2024.</p>



<p>Lillard appeared on YouTube channel JayBee &amp; Milly for an interview, and briefly spoke about his availability. He stated that he’s doing a TV show right now and “doing FNAF in October.” </p>



<p>In the first film adaptation, Matthew Lillard portrayed William Afton. Five Nights at Freddy’s earned the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-opening-weekend-is-the-biggest-for-a-live-action-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest opening weekend</a> for a live-action video game adaptation. So, Blumhouse naturally greenlit a 2025 release window for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 in May 2024. </p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/FNAF_ScottGames/status/1820217342489735365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, FNAF_ScottGames also revealed a production image for the anticipated sequel. The post has fans speculating on the character under construction.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans identify the character as Toy Bonnie, opening the door for a lot of potential story beats. Toy Bonnie remains a fan favorite character, who originally appeared in the Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 video game. </p>



<p>The toy animatronics are beloved characters, and they are tied to crucial elements of the larger mythology. It’s unclear if Toy Bonnie and corresponding characters will appear in flashbacks, given the game series timeline.</p>



<p>The original Five Nights at Freddy’s movie did include a lot of fan service. However, it still took many creative liberties. </p>



<p>The update teasing Toy Bonnie shows a lot of progress on Five Nights at Freddy’s 2. Actor Josh Hutcherson previously said the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-story-is-already-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story was in development</a> back in January 2024. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it's showing off the game's version of the timeless land of Hyrule, as well as how you can get around it.</p>
<p>Titled "A Tour of Hyrule", the trailer describes&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s world as "a land of plentiful abundance" in which you'll discover "diverse regions" filled with "interesting people".</p>
<p>First, we get to see the iconic Gerudo Desert, which has made an appearance in several&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games including <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time"><i>Ocarina of Time</i></a>,&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>, and, most recently,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. It returns here, complete with a town where you'll meet members of the Gerudo tribe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule-gerudo-desert.jpg?itok=Q5yn7862 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-hyrule-gerudo-desert.jpg?itok=xCkm5paJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gerudo Desert returns once again in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We're then introduced to Jabul Waters, an idyllic location that plays host to both the Sea Zora and the River Zora, who look vastly different but who both inhabit the water.</p>
<p>Eldin Volcano and Kakariko Village are also making a return, and naturally, Eldin is where you'll find the Gorons, as well as their favorite treat in the form of rock roast.</p>
<p>The final new area we're introduced to is the Faron Wetlands, a swampy area that is home to the Deku Scrubs, who are rumored to have a "voracious sweet tooth", according to the trailer. As you can see, you'll be well-served if you're hoping to spot classic&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>staples in&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>.</p>
<p>Following the new areas, we're then introduced to&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s quest log, which works similarly to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>'s, as well as its travel waypoints, which are fast travel points you can revisit once you've discovered them.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a horse, which you can use to hop over small walls and send smaller enemies flying. You'll be able to summon it from anywhere in the overworld.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">launching next month</a>, then you should check out the trailer in full. It also touches on new abilities, items you can equip, and the crafting-adjacent smoothie system, plus more.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>arrives <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Echoes-of-Wisdom-2590490.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a> on September 26th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom continues to look brilliant in this latest trailer from Nintendo that gives you a whistlestop tour of its version of Hyrule. 
</p>
<p>
From Hyrule Castle to Gerudo Desert and Kakariko Village, the upcoming Switch game will let Zelda see all the sights, plus hang out with Gorons, Deku Scrubs and both flavours of Zora. 
</p>
<p>
As well as fast travel points, Zelda will also be able to explore on horseback to hop over small echoes. Just create a carrot "echo" - using your ability to conjur up objects you've seen previously - and your trusty steed will come running.

<p>
Other sections of the trailer gave a look at other new powers, such as Bind - the ability to make objects or enemies move as you do. It's handy for moving boulders, or even monsters, right off of cliffs. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, Reverse Bond lets you attach yourself to moving objects, including animals such as flying gulls or wall-climbing spiders, to explore further.
</p>
<p>
Cooking also appears to be present - of a kind - although here you'll be making smoothies. Business-orientated Deku Scrubs will let you blend ingredients you've collected for helpful boosts - such as giving resistance to elemental effects or recharging hearts.
</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's launch on 26th September, fans have been busy trying to work out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-react-to-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reveal-with-timeline-speculation-and-adorable-artwork">where in the series' timeline Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sits.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creatures-of-ava-review-mystery-of-avatar-with-song-in-its-step</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creatures-of-ava-review-the-mystery-of-avatar-with-a-song-in-its-step.944886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creatures-of-ava-review-mystery-of-avatar-with-song-in-its-step<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> was a game that I went into expecting some fun animal collecting and puzzle solving, For the most part, that's what I got, but one major aspect of the game that I didn't expect to come away from was a shift in perspective about conservation, Climate Change, and how we always view it from human-kinds eyes.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> puts you in the shoes of Vic, an employee of the Aleph corporation, whose mission on the dying planet of Ava is to research the lifeforms that inhabit it, capture some to save them from the planet's destruction, and investigate the hostile 'Wither' that is infecting all life.</p>
<p>Early on in your adventure you meet Nim'ar, a member of the Naam race, who is investigating the ancient sites of Ava looking for information on how to stop the 'Wither' from continuing to take over the planet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=fMjbQJJw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-08.jpg?itok=r4m9DkMn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nim'ar is one of the Naam, a race that is able to hear the songs of the creatures and the planet itself</figcaption></figure><h2>Save The Creatures, Save Ava</h2>
<p>Through your journey, you won't just be working to preserve the flora and fauna of Ava from the Wither, but you'll also be investigating ancient ruins for Nim'ar. If you're already roaming the planet looking for different species, it can't hurt to also follow up on some leads of how it may have been combatted in the past.</p>
<p>As soon as I set foot on the planet of Ava my mind was drawn to parallels with the <em>Avatar </em>film franchise. Not only in the creation of a fantastical world filled with unique flora and fauna but also in the Naam race and the way they're a part of a hive mind with all other creatures and Ava itself.</p>
<p>It was a very interesting approach to the story, that Ava arriving had the best intentions but we are just humans showing up declaring that we'll save everyone without really understanding the problem or asking those on the planet if they even want to be saved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=LXgpKjqt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-11.jpg?itok=moRQzx9n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Vic isn't just investigating ancient ruins, but also the ruins that her own company has left behind</figcaption></figure><p>As the story was building I as the player was feeling at odds with the job that I was there to perform on behalf of the company, and how much of a 'savior' complex our character has. As more was learned about Ava I definitely could see how Vic's thinking was shifting, but even then the turns that the story takes I couldn't have predicted. They left me feeling quite humbled as a human in the presence of nature.</p>
<h2>Explore Four Biomes</h2>
<p>The gameplay of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> has Vic exploring each of the four areas of Ava. Within each, you'll be learning the song of the animals - as a way to tame and have them assist you in your exploration - seeking out new creatures to tame and transport back to your base, and exploring the ruins to help Nim'ar learn about how the ancient civilizations dealt with the Wither.</p>
<p>Whether you're following the primary quest line, hunting down any of the side-quests, or just exploring at your own pace you'll encounter countless little puzzles to tickle your brain with.</p>
<p>You might see an interesting item through some brambles. To reach that you'll first need to remove the Wither from a nearby beast, play its song to ingratiate it to you, and then use its ability to break away the bramble. As you get further into the game puzzles might require you to utilize the abilities of two or three creatures at a time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=IjhWXWqf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-01.jpg?itok=UPwXDWCP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Raga has a variety of abilities that you can use to reach new areas</figcaption></figure><p>To cleanse the Wither from a creature you need to form a link to it with your ancient staff, once a connection has been made the creature's infection will slowly whittle down. You can use abilities to drain the infection faster, raise the creature into the air, or even slow the creature down to make the process easier. You can cleanse multiple creatures at a time by creating a beam chain between them all.</p>
<p>While you're cleansing the creatures you have to be careful as they will fight back. They could charge at you, blast you with shockwaves, or dig up from under your feet. You'll need to be watching everyone's movements and dodging accordingly while maintaining your connection.</p>
<p>Cleansing feels like the gameplay of the poltergust of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4a328c3b-49f3-48a6-9879-9ac7c3863b9d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/luigis-mansion-3-review"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> but with a lot more going on than just 'don't break the chain'. For each combat scenario, you'll need to be balanced making a steady pace toward your objective, cleansing the creature, while also dodging left and right, and watching out for your ability cooldowns. At no point would I say that the process was difficult but enjoyably challenging.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-13.jpg?itok=3a_3eVgX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-13.jpg?itok=xQSdxB7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your beam has been established it's a game of avoiding taking damage</figcaption></figure><h2>Relaxing Exploration Of Ava</h2>
<p>Reaching a new area I always made it my goal to just pick a direction and start exploring. Whether I found new creatures to pet or take photos of, upgrades for Vic, or the main plot I was having not only a wonderful but a relaxing time.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel pressured to progress the story, and the world never felt so large or daunting that I wasn't happy to explore every inch of it. This might be one of the most relaxing games I've ever played because of it.</p>
<p>Each new area you travel to is also sizably smaller than the one before, meaning that as the story reaches its natural crescendo your progress isn't stopped because you still have 1/4 of the game to get through. I felt my time and attention was respected in this way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=A3U3RsrY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-19.jpg?itok=queYZUoF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>While I appreciate a clear 'point of no return' I would much rather not be locked out of half of the game</figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of <em>Creatures of Ava</em> that did frustrate me as someone who enjoys collecting in games, but also in making story progress is the number of "point of no returns" that are present in the game. Starting with the second biome once you're done with the story quest of that area you lose access to it.</p>
<p>Because of this, at any point in time, you only ever have access to two out of the game's four areas. You'll be presented with a helpful 'point of no return' screen, but it also felt like I was being shamed by the game for wanting to progress the story while I hadn't taken a photo of all of the wind chimes in the area.</p>
<p>It's disappointing to think that in a game that has so many fun puzzles stashed away in its world, you can lock yourself out of half of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=icPwHy0A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/creatures-of-ava-17.jpg?itok=NQaEre5r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Through your adventure, Vic will see Ava in a very different way</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Creatures of Ava</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is going to be one of those games that sit with me for a long time. While completing the story and scouring the world might not promote replayability, especially with how much of the game you lose access to as you play, the message of the game is one I'm going to continue to muse on.</p>
<p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> shows a beautiful world on the verge of death, and while science is trying to protect and preserve it, starts to ask big questions about how we understand and interact with nature from a very specific human point of view.</p>
<p>The gameplay was relaxing and rewarding, with so many interesting nooks and crannies of the world to explore. I also enjoyed that <em>Creatures of Ava</em> never overstayed its welcome. It arrived, politely shared with me an interesting story about a strange and fantastical world, and then left leaving me with delightful things to ponder.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
Creatures of Ava is a wonderful adventure that wraps together an interesting story about humankind's view of nature, exploration of a beautiful alien world, and interesting creature taming mechanics. While I'd wish to continue exploring this game a major detriment is how you get locked out of half the game as you play through it.

Zelda will also be able to ride a horse that can jump over ledges, and fast travel between waypoints she discovers on her journey. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-link-to-past-1851551343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-timeline-link-to-past-1851551343">This version of Hyrule might</a></span> be in a retro-chibi art style but it’s anything but a throwback to the older games’ overworld maps. </p><p>Here’s a look:</p><p>The new footage takes players through Hyrule Castle and the surrounding city, the desert and its Gerudo village, the aquatic homes of the river Zora and sea Zora respectively, and the fiery mountains where the Goron eat rocks all day long. Zelda will also encounter tons of side-quests during her journey, where she’ll be called on to use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-meme-reactions-1851550785">her wand duplication magic (called echoes)</a></span> to clone objects and help residents and fellow wanderers in need. </p><p>In addition to her trusty steed, which can trample enemies and be summoned by creating carrot echoes, there are also smoothie shops where Zelda can mix-and-match the ingredients she’s collected on her travels to get various status buffs, just like Link has been doing in the cooking minigames for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Zelda can change outfits too, in order to augment not just her look but also her abilities. </p><p>The final mechanic outlined in the trailer is Zelda’s bind ability. In addition to summoning echoes of objects found in the world, she’ll also be able to bind objects to her that will follow her around when she moves. Reverse-bind, meanwhile, will make her follow the objects, help her hang from moving platforms or catch rides on fast creatures in the world around her. </p><p>Out September 26, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> really does seem like it’s shaping up to take the lessons learned from <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> when it comes to open world experimentation and freeform puzzle solving. A lot of fans have been hoping Zelda’s first playable entry in the series wouldn’t be just an off-year B-side, and so far that thankfully doesn’t seem to be the case at all. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/05/monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-focus-mode-seikret-slinger-wirebug/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Capcom has released a trio of short explainer videos for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, the next game in the hit monster hunting series, showcasing both core gameplay fundamentals for the Seikret and Slinger, as well as the new Focus Mode.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basic mechanics:</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Basic Mechanics Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lc57d8BTSpM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This video digs into the absolute basics, such as how hunter have both sheathed and drawn weapon states, with the former allowing faster movement and the use of items. It also shows off the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment. Pretty handy!</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Focus Mode Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v3lnXyNFhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Focus Mode is a new mechanic and combat technique, letting you aim your attacks and guards more precisely. They will now go in the direction the camera is facing, giving you more manual control. Focus Mode will highlight wounds on monsters, which you’ll then want to directly target to deal extra damage. It also enables Focus Strikes, which are particular special attacks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Great Sword | Weapon Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t2h3Uxj7nNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And finally, there’s a look at the Great Sword, one of the many weapons that will feature in Monster Hunter Wilds. A series staple, this is at the slower, heavier end of the scale, but the weapon overview video shows how it can be used with hit-and-run tactics, can guard, and then how Focus Mode can deal massive damage.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC in 2025. With two big trailers for the game shown so far – see them <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/first-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-revealed/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer/">here</a> – the next is expected to be released during Opening Night Live for Gamescom 2024 later this month.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-director-monolith-soft-new-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-directors-monolith-soft-studio-announces-brand-new-rpg.944853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-director-monolith-soft-new-rpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>director Tetsuya Takahashi and his studio Monolith Soft have announced that they're recruiting for a brand new RPG, and it sounds like it might be a bit different to what you're used to from the developer.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/recruit/production/rpg.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message</a> on the official Monolith Soft website (which is in Japanese; we're using machine translation), Takahashi says he's recruiting staff for Monolith's "first production for the first time in a long time". It's unclear exactly what he means by this, since <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-3-release-date-unveiled">launched just two years ago</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phrasing might be a quirk of machine translation, or it might mean that Takahashi and Monolith are setting out to create a brand new IP, which would be the studio's first since 2010's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(if you don't count 2012's&nbsp;<em>Namco x Capcom&nbsp;</em>followup&nbsp;<em>Project X Zone</em>, that is).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-3-monolith-soft-tetsuya-takahashi.jpg?itok=o1kGMmqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-3-monolith-soft-tetsuya-takahashi.jpg?itok=Oef4e54D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade</em>'s Monolith Soft is working on a new game.</figcaption></figure><p>Takahashi says that the days of creating large-scale games with smaller teams are over, and that it now needs people with "a wide range of knowledge", as well as "connections that utilize that knowledge".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that each area of an RPG, from its overworld to its characters and battle system, is "closely linked" to the next, and so it's important to have staff members who can work together on these elements rather than separately.</p>
<p>Sadly, details about Monolith Soft's new RPG are somewhat thin on the ground; Takahashi says he can't go into detail regarding what the RPG will look like now, but that he and his studio want "as many customers as possible" to enjoy his games.</p>
<p>He also reiterates that Monolith is, despite his newfound ambitions, "not a rigid organization"; rather, it's still a "relatively rough and sloppy organization", and that's what makes his team "unique".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-monolith-soft-shulk.jpg?itok=xrKoHtzB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-monolith-soft-shulk.jpg?itok=qzi2IBji 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Monolith Soft's last new IP was&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, unless you count&nbsp;<em>Project X Zone</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever we can expect from Monolith Soft's new project, it sounds like it won't be a followup to any of the studio's existing properties, so it might be a good idea to stop holding out hope for that&nbsp;<em>Xenosaga&nbsp;</em>sequel. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

<p>This is significant because in the&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>series, New Mexico is where you'll find the headquarters of the Black Mesa Research Facility, or at least you would have done before the events of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>took place.</p>
<p>As such, if&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands&nbsp;</em>isn't a new&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>game of some description, then Valve is playing a rather nasty prank on its fans. Then again, it's entirely possible this internal codename was never supposed to see the light of day, and that it's an ironic inside joke of some kind.</p>
<p>It might seem particularly cruel to throw a bone to&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>fans almost 17 years after the last non-VR&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>title gave them (or perhaps I should say "us" hope), but could this be cause for new optimism? I, for one, very much hope so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-episode-2-project-white-sands.jpg?itok=uKZaEvCQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-episode-2-project-white-sands.jpg?itok=nykMsO_7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's been 17 years since the last Valve-developed non-VR&nbsp;<em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the second suggestion within the last few months that Valve might be ramping up its development wing again. Back in May, leaked info regarding a hero shooter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Deadlock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-theres-leaked-footage-of-valves-new-game-deadlock" rel="noopener" target="_blank">started circulating</a>, although Valve hasn't confirmed whether that's a project in active development or not.</p>
<p>Of course, just like&nbsp;<em>Deadlock</em>, there's a chance&nbsp;<em>Project White Sands&nbsp;</em>might never see the light of day, although if Valve is far along enough to hire voice actors, that might be an encouraging sign. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The <strong>13-inch M3 MacBook Air </strong>with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $849.98 (around $250 off) in all available colors at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX22ZW1T?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. And for those who want more storage or RAM, Amazon is also selling the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX261SRT?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">8GB RAM / 512GB configuration for $1,049.98</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX246FNZ?tag=theverge02-20">16GB RAM / 512GB version for $1,249.98</a> — each around $250 off.</p><p>If you can spend the extra dough, that highest-specced model is ideal since it has the performance headroom to last quite a long time. However, even the base MacBook Air is a great all-around machine, especially since its 256GB SSD no longer clocks at slower speeds like previous generations.</p><p>Apple’s latest version of the Air came out earlier this year and was given some modest upgrades over its predecessor, including a faster M3 processor, the ability to use two external monitors with the lid closed, and Wi-Fi 6E. There are really no downsides to picking the M3 Air over the older M2 model, aside from the higher price — and today’s deal makes that delta just $50.</p><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">Read our review of the 13-inch MacBook Air M3</a>.</h4></p><div><p>The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A further helping of great deals</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>10ft Philips Hue Solo Lightstrip</strong> is selling for a new low of $54.17 (about $15 off <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.philips-hue.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Flightstrips-solo-lightstrip-10-feet%2F046677589875">MSRP</a>) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D328GL5M?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-incorporate-this-absurd-game-shuffling-sonic-mod-into-every-other-video-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Every so often, the fine folk of Resetera take a break from their usual schedule of complaining that video games journalists get all their news from Resetera, and post a Thing Of Beauty. For example: it's thanks to Resetera member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-sonic-mod-is-insane.944673/">AstralSphere</a> that I know about Alistair Aitcheson's <a href="https://www.alistairaitcheson.com/games/magicbox.html">Magic Box and BizHawk retro emulation tools</a>, which - amongst other things - allow you to play old Sonic the Hedgehog games in giddy parallel, shuffling between them whenever you collect a ring.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you have even the slightest understanding of games featuring Sega's prickly pinball, you will know that switching games whenever Sonic collects a ring is a recipe for panic and confusion beyond Dr Robotnik's wildest and wettest daydreams. That was certainly the conclusion of streamers participating in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zw-wW20VG8&amp;t=368s">the latest episode of Random Number Generation</a>, a Games Done Quick show dedicated to randomisation mods and their communities (beware rapid screen-flashing during the transitions). </p>
<p>Here's the thing, though: I played Sonic a bunch back in the day, and as regards certain Sonic levels, <em>I think I could keep up with this</em>. Specifically, Green Hill Zone and its equivalents, of which I have muscle memories so deeply engraved they will be visible as glinting threads within the swirling tissues of my spirit, as and when the Good Lord packs me off to my personal 16-bit heaven.</p>
<p>More importantly, it strikes me that shuffling between games based on certain actions would be a wonderful way to clear my backlog, by splicing together games at random. Picture it: you're hoeing the pumpkin patch in Stardew Valley and all of a sudden your hoe is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-best-weapons">Bloodhound's Fang</a> and the pumpkin patch is a cauldron of Rot and there is a stinking golden lady with big hair doing butterfly combos at you. You dodge-roll past her and oh shitballs, you've just invaded the Karaz Ankor and Thorgrim Grudgebearer is absolutely livid.</p>
<p>After many hours of hard campaigning and a gruelling battle in the foothills of the Everpeak, you succeed in felling the High King, which isn't much consolation now that you're trapped in a cupboard in Amnesia: The Bunker. Forget mods: this should be an official platform feature. Perhaps a certification requirement. Imagine it, a games industry built like the Quantum Leap TV show, with games full of hidden wormholes into other games. Questions of pacing would become irrelevant, and today's arguments about skill would fade to echoes, because nobody would have a clue what the hell they're playing at any given second, or what the hell they'll be playing next.</p>
<p>If Alistair Aitcheson seems like an RPS kinda guy, that could be because (as I've just discovered) our former deputy editor Alice B went to school with him. His other works include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-book-ritual-is-a-game-about-shredding-a-book-made-by-someone-i-was-at-school-with">the Book Ritual</a>, in which you shred books that "think they're human" - the loose idea being to explore your attachment to a physical object. It feels like the Magic Box and BizHawk tools are kind of doing the same thing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>“Helping people with their troubles is a big part of your journey,” the trailer says, “and wise heroes are often rewarded for their good deeds.”</p>



<p>There are also various waypoints for fast travel that will help you along your journey. You’ll also get access to a horse mount that you can call using a carrot echo from anywhere in the overworld.</p>



<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is the first game in the classic franchise that has players play as Princess Zelda, herself.

    <p><span>Regions and other useful functions introduced.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,550 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a></em> introducing some of the regions players will visit during their adventure, as well as other useful functions. <span id="more-903598"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Regions</strong></p><p>Welcome to Hyrule, a vast land where Princess Zelda will journey through her grand adventure. Hyrule is a land of plentiful abundance, from the Central Plateau where Hyrule Castle stands enfolded by its Castle Town, to the outermost reaches, you’ll encounter new and interesting people in each of its diverse regions.</p><ul><li><strong>Gerudo Desert</strong> – The Gerudo Desert consists of scorching dunes as far as the eye can see and is prone to frequent sandstorms that’s no problem for the women of the Gerudo Tribe. Though there are many ruins full of mysteries here, and an oasis—a great place to relax.</li><li><strong>Jabul Waters</strong> – Jabul Waters is home to some of Hyrule’s most scenic waterways. It’s also where you can find the Sea Zora and the River Zora, who each reside in their respective villages. Though they don’t always get along. What could they be fighting about?</li><li><strong>Eldin Volcano</strong> – Daunting cliffs and lava flows dominate the Eldin Volcano region. Pacarico Village is nestled at the mountain’s base, but you’ll have to brave treacherous trails to reach the home of the Gorons. Those rocks may look delicious—alas, they are not for Hylians.</li><li><strong>Faron Wetlands</strong> – The Faron Wetlands are a lush labyrinth of vegetation. As you wander the jungle you might come across a Deku Scrub. Rumor has it these peculiar creatures have a voracious sweet tooth.</li></ul><p>During your travels you’re likely to encounter people dealing with problems great and small. Keep track of quests by browsing your <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,647 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a> Log whenever you’d like. Helping people with their troubles is a big part of your journey, and wise heroes are often rewarded for their good deeds.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Waypoints</strong></p><p>Objects known as Waypoints are scattered throughout the land. Once you’ve discovered one, you can return toit quickly by selecting it on your map. Even with the benefit of fast travel, getting around Hyrule can prove challenging. At times like these, why walk when you can ride? Gallop right over weaker enemies to send them flying, and hop over small obstacles with ease. Once you learn to make a Carrot Echo, you’ll be able to call upon your trusty steed from anywhere in the overworld.</p><p><strong>Smoothie Shops</strong></p><p>As you explore you may come across smoothie shops manned by Business Scrubs. Here you can blend the ingredients you’ve collected into delicious drinks. Smoothies have different effects based on the ingredients you choose. They’re sure to come in handy during your travels. You can also equip outfits and accessories to enhance your abilities—and to look fashionable, obviously.</p><p><strong>Abilities: Bind and Reverse Bond</strong></p><p>Whether you’re trekking over rugged plateaus, through winding caves, or other complex locales, creating Echoes is key to success. But sometimes they may not be enough. A huge boulder like this cannot be learned as an Echo, and your other Echo won’t move it either. For obstacles like these, Tri has got you covered with the power of Bind. Use it to make even a massive boulder follow Zelda’s movement. Bind can help you unearth buried treasure, or even reposition troublesome enemies. You can also use Bind on your Echoes. So get creative and find ways to forge ahead.</p><p>Alternatively if you want to follow a moving object yourself, you can use Reverse Bond to go where it goes. Take advantage of a creature’s ability to fly or to move around quickly. Swapping between Bind and Reverse Bond is a great way to find clever paths forward. Let your imagination run wild and you’re bound to come up with all sorts of ideas. Use Bind in combination with your Echoes to overcome obstacles. Understanding how these two abilities work together will be essential to your progress.</p><p>Mysterious rifts are overtaking Hyrule. What else will Zelda have to contend with in her grand adventure to save her kingdom? There’s only one way to find out!</p></blockquote><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,737 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> on September 26.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><h2><span>Traversing Hyrule Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Traversing Hyrule Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DolGuwvAnfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="ゼルダの伝説 知恵のかりもの | ハイラルのあるきかた2 大地篇" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0bJcXdkAla0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Like the previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, the publisher is aiming to make this new entry in the Monster Hunter series more accessible to newcomers, as anyone looking to hone their skills can use the new Focus Mode to deliver powerful killing blows.</p><p>When using Focus Mode, you can aim your attacks or set up a guard more precisely, as these moves will be directed to where the camera is facing. You can also use Focus Mode to highlight wounds on a monster--these are formed by attacking the same spot several times--and deal extra damage when you strike these vulnerable spots.

From a new battle pass (well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-will-now-have-two-battle-passes-per-season-says-respawn/1100-6524756/">two new battle passes</a>, technically) to a new map--and even a new way to wield everyone's least-favorite weapons--the upcoming season will have plenty of content to keep players entertained. But behind every new feature added to the game is a story, so GameSpot spoke to Respawn's Apex Legends development team to learn more about Shockwave's creation.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to world director Ed Agostini, lead weapons designer Eric Canavese, design director and director of player investment Chris "C4" Cleroux, game designer John Larson, associate design director Josh Mohan, and senior design director Evan Nikolich, GameSpot got a behind-the-scenes look at some of the biggest game-changers set to hit Apex when Season 22: Shockwave goes live on Tuesday, August 6.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends - Official Shockwave Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of the most shocking features unveiled in the Shockwave's gameplay trailer was the new "akimbo" pistol mechanic, which allows players to dual-wield a pair of P2020s or a pair of Mozambiques. These two weapons are easily some of the weakest in the game, and players usually abandon them in favor of a stronger weapon as soon as they find one. GameSpot was eager to hear the story behind the akimbo pistols, and was surprised to learn that the dual-wielding feature was originally used in the testing process for a new (currently unreleased) weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">"We just really wanted to do it," Canavese explained, grinning. "You know, I've played dual-wield weapons in a lot of games before, and [there has] always [been] that question in the back of our minds: 'What would that ever look like in Apex?' I think we had finished releasing a weapon, and it was like, 'Well, what should we do next?'"</p><p dir="ltr">"We were trying lots of different prototypes, and we were like, 'Well, what if we try dual-wielding pistols?'" Canavese continued. "The way that it started was we actually had designed a whole new gun around akimbo, and it was fun and there were some cool quirks to it. But when we were playing it, we said, 'Oh, well, what if we just made this a system and used it on guns that we currently have?' And there were no better options than the P2020 and the Mozambique, which are generally very weak and lower-tier weapons that you get rid of [early in a match]. So there was this desire to kind of find out what it would be like to finish games and unironically run [the P2020 and Mozambique] into the endgame and final rings. Focusing in on their CQC capabilities meant they were a really viable option for those final rings where everybody kind of closes in on each other. You don't really need to be ADSing at that point, so [there's] just this, like, crazy hip-fire spray-and-pray with these guns [that] felt really good."</p><p dir="ltr">Canavese explained that the development of the new akimbo pistols required a lot of trial and error, but ultimately, the devs emerged victorious.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345514-akimbo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345514-akimbo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345514"></a><figcaption>Apex's new akimbo mechanic lets players dual-wield the P2020 or the Mozambique. The best part? Akimbo pistols only take up a single weapon slot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345514-akimbo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"This is what we landed on, and we're actually really, really happy with how they turned out," Canavese said of the dual-wielding mechanic, which effectively trades the ability to ADS for major weapon buffs, making the pistols fully automatic with an increased rate of fire and tighter bullet spread when hip-firing.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, the next thing we wanted to know was if the original, currently unreleased weapon Respawn had initially used to design the akimbo mechanic would ever appear in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"If it ever comes back, it will probably be much different," Canavese told GameSpot. "We did like things about it, it just didn't feel like the right time to release something like that. But never say never! It's in our tool chest of prototypes, and if we ever find that a season needs something like that--or the weapon roster and the meta are feeling stale in some way, and that sort of addition can improve it--then absolutely. We always like going back to old prototypes that had some legs. That's always on the table."</p><p dir="ltr">Moving on to the topic of Shockwave's new map--the enormous, cyberpunk-themed E-District--we inquired about the inspiration behind the map itself and the POIs within it. During previews, Apex Legends world director Ed Agostini said that "building a night map brings its challenges," and explained that creating the densely packed map forced the dev team to ask themselves, "What does a night map look like that's well-lit?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the POIs were designed first and foremost for gameplay," Agostini told GameSpot, adding that Tokyo's Shibuya Center was a huge inspiration for the map at large, but also its Neon Square POI.</p><p dir="ltr">"Shibuya Center [was] the inspiration [for Neon Square] because we were creating a downtown core and we had this major intersection," Agostini explained. "Blossom Drive has some inspiration from other parts of Tokyo as well, with the canals and the sakura trees. I think the other POIs--when we talk about other cultures--we would infuse cultures into some of the POIs like the Galleria has a very Arabic theme, same with our resort. We have all of our apartments, [and] you'll find Korean and Chinese influences in there. Some of [the architecture] has a bit of Japanese or Asian flavor, because we were inspired by Ghost in the Shell and [other] anime as well. So we're trying to capture a bit of that in every aspect of the map."</p><p dir="ltr">But a new map--especially one the size of E-District--brings with it new challenges, and GameSpot was eager to learn if the development team faced any roadblocks while creating Apex's latest digital playground.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think [when you're] building a dense map like this, you know that not every square inch is going to be playable," Agostini said. "Not every building is going to be enterable, and in Apex, more often than not, all our buildings can be interacted with. So we had to kind of come up with a visual language that was very clear. Buildings that are enterable are well-lit, they have color on them, and then the buildings that are not [able to be entered] are usually more [like a] backdrop and kind of grey. Now, we do have buildings that you can still clamber over and play on the rooftop, but we call them 'dud buildings.' They fill up the rotations and they just give you a bit more cover as you're going through the spaces."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345519-e-districtmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345519-e-districtmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345519"></a><figcaption>The new E-District map draws inspiration from a number of real-life Asian cities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345519-e-districtmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That was one challenge: to think outside the box and [think about] how we take the Apex design language and layouts and translate that into an urban environment," Agostini continued. "And then another [challenge] is probably just setting this whole thing at night. We've done night maps before, but I think this time we wanted to make sure that players [aren't going] to feel frustrated because it's too dark. So we had to find that right level of artificial light from light pollution and all the neon, and bring up the visibility so that it still gives you the impression of night, but it's gameplay-friendly, first and foremost."</p><p dir="ltr">While on the topic of visibility, GameSpot asked the devs about some of the new changes to Battle Sense, an in-game system meant to function as a sort of "sixth sense" for players. Season 22 will see the introduction of both visible enemy health bars and a new feature that highlights enemies when they're close to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">"Enemy health bars will take the guesswork out of how much damage you're doing to each opponent, and [allow you to see] if they really are 'one shot' [away from being downed]," associate design director Josh Mohan explained during Season 22 previews.</p><p dir="ltr">"Exactly how far [away enemies are highlighted], I don't think we know right off the top," Canavese told GameSpot. "We were tuning it up and down right until the very end, so where exactly it landed is much more of a 'feel' thing than it was to make sure that it worked at specific ranges. I think players will notice that as they're playing it. Hopefully they'll be like, 'That seems about right.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"These [Battle Sense features] will be opt-in/opt-out so players can play the way they want," Mohan chimed in. "We feel these are powerful tools--we're going to turn them on by default--but ultimately, it's in the player's hands to control the kind of experience they want."</p><p dir="ltr">After getting the lowdown on the new map and seasonal gameplay changes, it was time to learn more about what is easily the most controversial change to Apex's seasonal formula: the decision to swap out a single, 110-level battle pass for two individual, 60-level battle passes each season.</p><p dir="ltr">Initially, Respawn announced that the new battle passes would also be accompanied by a change in how those battle passes are purchased. Instead of being able to use Apex Coins (AC) earned from completing previous battle passes to unlock new ones, players would only be able to purchase them directly for $10 each, putting an end to five years of battle passes that were effectively free once a player completed the first battle pass they ever purchased.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-steam-review-score-plummets-in-the-wake-of-new-battle-pass-changes/1100-6525121/">players review-bombing the game</a>, sending its Steam user-score plummeting from "overwhelmingly positive" to "mostly positive" (it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently sitting at a "mixed" overall rating</a>). In response to the negative feedback from players, Respawn made some last-minute changes to the new battle-pass system, once again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-22-battle-pass-changes-again-following-outcry/1100-6525269/">allowing players to unlock each pass by spending 950 AC</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345520-battlepassanger.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345520" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345520-battlepassanger.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345520"></a><figcaption>Players were not pleased with certain aspects of the new battle pass system, so Respawn walked back some of the changes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4345520-battlepassanger.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">During previews, the devs explained that the reasons behind the changes to the battle-pass system were twofold: Many players weren't even finishing their battle pass, so splitting it in half seemed like the best solution to that issue. Additionally, players who <em>did</em> finish their battle pass weren't equipping most of the loot they'd unlocked by completing it, which resulted in a loot overhaul and the removal of seasonal stat trackers.</p><p dir="ltr">"The thing is, [seasonal splits] do attract some players to come back, or re-engage[s] new players, and if you're coming back and you've lapsed in the battle pass, it feels too daunting [to complete it], and [players] also feel like, 'Why? Why should I care?'" senior design director Evan Nikolich told GameSpot. "If you're new, it's not even worth it for you to engage, so splitting up the two battle passes allows for [mid-season re-engagement], and also meets the player-behavior expectations in today's market. Players get pulled all around [by] the different games that come in and out, and having an option to come back in and play your game [and let it have] a meaningful progression is something we wanted to do."</p><p dir="ltr">But these changes also mean that players who want to complete an entire season's pair of battle passes will ultimately be faced with a total of 120 levels to grind through each season instead of 110. So why split the battle pass in two--adding an extra 10 levels for players to unlock every season--instead of just increasing the amount of XP Boosts gained in each battle pass?</p><p dir="ltr">"We could do the the rocketing of XP and whatnot, but with it comes a more tricky economic balance versus splitting it up in two," Nikolich explained. "I think [splitting it] is just a cleaner option for the player."</p><p dir="ltr">With all the changes coming to the game in Season 22, we wanted to know which new feature the dev team was most proud of, and most excited to see players react to.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm gonna say Bot Royale, giving players an opportunity to have that kind of safe space to be able to practice and onboard their friends," design director Chris "C4" Cleroux answered, referring to a new PvE limited-time mode that will launch during the new season. "It's accessible to everybody, and it's not [like] that limited orientation match. I really hope players will enjoy that experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends players will get a first-hand look at all the new features discussed above when Season 22: Shockwave goes live on Tuesday, August 6 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p>

<p>From Kuo-Toa brandishing their simple weapons, to powerful creatures like Miska The Wolf-Spider and Tasha herself this box offers a wide variety of miniatures to add to your collection. This variety comes from the variety of regions that players will be visiting throughout their time in the Vecna Adventure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're interested in checking out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/podcasts/vecna-eve-of-ruin-session-1-techraptor-podcast-117">start of the <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em> adventure then you can see TechRaptor playing most of the first chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Wizkids <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e5de03d1-d8cd-419d-8918-561c018bd3c0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins"><em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em></a> offers a variety of packages for those interested in purchasing. You can obtain Miska the Wolf-Spider as a stand-alone mini, a group of Kuo-Toa, and blind box miniatures - each with one large mini, and three medium minis.</p>
<h2>Miska The Wolf-Spider Spins A Web</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-miska-the-wolf-spider.jpg?itok=cXGW_HSI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-miska-the-wolf-spider.jpg?itok=PYpBEIjc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starting large Miska the Wolf-Spider is a demon lord with "the lower body of a massive armored spider, four arms, and two enormous wolf heads that drip poison." While only at the Large size class the details in this miniature should be enough to strike fear into the heart of any party.</p>
<p>Each wolf head is covered in smatterings of blood as Miska holds their reigns. A nice touch for this mini is that the legs of the spider section of Miska's body aren't connected. As you pick up or move this mini each leg can slightly flex adding to the creepy sensation.</p>
<p>Unlike most Wizkids minis this one is posed in a different method from their official artwork, which depicts Miska channeling energy through his hands. The action-ready post of the miniature is a nice touch.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-spider-and-drider.jpg?itok=BGiLicb- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-spider-and-drider.jpg?itok=tHVCwB0G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Continuing with the theme of spiders the Drider and Giant Spider can be obtained from the Blind Boxes. Feeling like a de-evolution of Miska the Drider raises tall brandishing their weapon, ready to strike down.</p>
<p>The spindly legs of both of these miniatures mirror the effect on Miska adding a level of realism to the mini. Faint texturing across the back of the spiders also does a good job of catching just enough light to look like hairs standing up.</p>
<h2>Witches, and Robots, and Bears</h2>
<p>Headlining miniatures from the blind boxes include the important Lady Alustriel Silverhand and Tasha. These two characters are important not just for the greater <em>D&amp;D</em> lore but are two primary NPCs that the party will interact with throughout <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin.</em></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-aulustriel-and-tasha.jpg?itok=BYZvMiHz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-aulustriel-and-tasha.jpg?itok=lsUNe3j7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lady Silverhand stands at the ready, arms outstretched in a flowing blue dress, with her Unicorn head topped Staff of Silverymoon.Her outfit features many of the important gold decorative features going down her torso and along the trim of her dress. Her face too is filled with a calm look that shows the confidence of this CR 21 combatant.</p>
<p>The Tasha present in this box, Tasha The Witch, is not the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="440d3268-9205-402d-a672-1f2e65ddd393" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-review-perfect-for-more-than-one-shot-but-not">present-day Tasha</a> but a version of herself summoned by her present-day incarnation to come to the aid of Alustriel's request. This miniature of Tasha is a capital-W witch complete with a wand, purple cloak, cape, and pointed hat.</p>
<p>The soft plastic of the WizKids miniatures did warp her wand somewhat but a bit of time outside of bubblewrap and packaging has corrected it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Humanoid Creatures</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-humanoids.jpg?itok=yhaGzFye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-humanoids.jpg?itok=QUmKW2Uh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I pulled a few interesting humanoid characters including a Black Rose Bearer, Deadbark Dryad, Moonlight Guardian, and a Warforged Blade.</p>
<p>Each of these characters is quite striking in their poses. Each has an arm outstretched, whether it be the Black Rose Bearer holding the flower of it's namesake or the Moonlight Guardian lurching forward with its Moonlight Slam.</p>
<p>The action being shown in these Minis are some of my favorites from the set.</p>

<p>A unique set of Mini's that I obtained from the blind boxes were three different types of Angry Commoners. Whether it be a raucous day in town, or under some kind of magical influence I got a real kick out of the idea of being able to place down some standard commoners to create some conflict for the party.</p>
<h2>Devils Filled With Details</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-large-devils.jpg?itok=V9_T6yxK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-large-devils.jpg?itok=gj9WWMHY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different range of devils crawling their way out of Avernus was a sight to behold. Within the 8 Blind Boxes I received I managed to pull six different devil related miniatures, five of which contained the word Devil in their name.</p>
<p>For large miniatures, the Horned Devil draws forth its spear with raised wings while the Ice Devil stands stoic with its insectoid features. The Horned Devil is a really exceptional mini with how large its wings are and how it really controls the space around it. I do have some concerns with how you might fit other minis around it, but it also adds to its oppressive nature.</p>
<p>This group of Devils really shows just how versatile the field of Devils is, even if their naming isn't.</p>
<p>Joining them are the Bearded Devil and Chain Devil. Much as the names would imply the purple devil has a green beard of poisonous spurs. The purple mixed with green is definitely not a natural color and really stands out fiercely when looking at this mini from a distance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-devils.jpg?itok=7phvYHjS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-devils.jpg?itok=9nPGqY8L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Chained Devil is just as on the nose about its theme being draped head to toe in chains. Even though there are a lot of chains there's been a lot of work put into the texturing to make sure it doesn't look like it's wearing a lumpy grey sweater but that it's actually wearing chains.</p>
<p>The smallest Spined Devil is a great representation of the kinds of stereotypical imp devils. Wings out with a small dragonoid head and a pitchfork in hand.</p>
<p>While only a CR 2 this creature can use the spines on its tail for ranged attacks, has magical resistance, and doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity when flying. For a low-level party, there are a large number of tricks that this creature can break out.</p>
<p>While not a devil in name the Merregon, a servant soul of fallen evil warriors, can be found in "everlasting servitude" in the Nine Hells. Despite suffering from some misshaping of its halberd the build on this character is truly intimidating.</p>
<p>Contrasting the large frame and shining gold armor the headpiece for the Merregon is that of a baby. Honestly it just makes the whole ensemble more terrifying as you look at it.</p>
<h2>Kuo-Toa Whether You Want Them Or Not</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=DbpD5MUJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-kuo-toa.jpg?itok=M5OcMjq0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While you can get Kuo-Toa as a separate package it's also possible to get Kuo-Toa in the Blind Boxes. Within the 8 that I opened, I happened across six additional Kuo-Toa to add to my collection.</p>
<p>While the Kuo-Toa box and Blind Box variants wear different colored outfits there are a variety of poses and roles for each. The ease in obtaining different Kuo-Toa does mean if you're interested in them there's a high chance to get them, and with different roles and colors you can make one stand out in a group of them.</p>
<h2>Humans, Skeletons, Boars, and More</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-skeletons.jpg?itok=VCdEEvKD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-skeletons.jpg?itok=_cIRDMZo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Adding further to the kinds of evergreen miniatures available to players are skeletons of different poses. Whether unarmed but angrily shaking their fists or brandishing weapons there are a number of skeletons that will fit into any encounter.</p>
<p>Some more large creatures that I came across were a Warg, complete with a goblin rider, a Blazebear baring its teeth and paw ready to attack, a Vrock, and a Star Angler.</p>
<p>Each of these shows off just how strange the creatures of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> can become. The Blazebear shows what happens when ambient magic is able to corrupt a creature. Not only will attacks from this bear do additional force damage but if it attacks a spellcaster as a reaction there's a chance that they'll force the spell to fail.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-abominations.jpg?itok=3CxIdLaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizkids-vecna-eve-of-ruin-miniatures-abominations.jpg?itok=naRabKoq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Vrock looks to be something pulled straight out of The Dark Crystal, a missing link between dinosaurs and birds. This is another instance of a strange creature influenced by magic and toxicity.</p>
<p>The Star Angler just looks wrong. As if you flipped a fish upside down, but decided to give it a light stalk. These denizens of Wildspace can lure prey with their lights before enveloping them in their maw. It's really hard to look at this scaled being and not just immediately understand that there's something 'wrong' about it. It's unsettling nature is a testament to the creators at Wizkids.</p>

<p>As always Wizkids has done an incredible job representing key creatures from an officially released Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure. In this collection you've got a mix of fodder enemies, all the way up to important characters like Tasha or Miska the Wolf-Spider.</p>
<p>Obviously with Blind Boxes there's no perfect way to know what you're going to get but there is enough variety there to keep bringing surprises to your table. The benefit of the Vecna adventure is also that it spans a variety of planes so what you can get can truly be all over the place. If you're wanting something consistent to a theme for a home game this is a wild-card situation.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
The Wizkids Vecna Eve of Ruin D&amp;D Miniatures set features a variety of high CR monsters down to fun fodder to throw at your table. While the theme is a bit all over the place that is the nature of the adventure it coincides with. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>On the official Monster Hunter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>, Capcom shadowdropped three brand-new Monster Hunter Wilds gameplay trailers today.</p>



<p>The trailers concentrate on basic mechanics, the signature Great Sword, and the new Focus Mode. It also showcases some of the monsters and environments players will encounter.</p>



<p>Although longtime fans may recognize some mechanics in these trailers, they also show new features coming to Monster Hunter Wilds. Besides Focus Mode, that includes a breakdown of the Seikret and its mount system.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: Focus Mode Overview" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v3lnXyNFhI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Today’s trailers reveal that Focus Mode allows players to use their camera to aim both their attacks and guards. Focus Mode will also highlight weak points, and any wounds inflicted on monsters. Players can use the mode to deal extra damage to those wounds.</p>



<p>Though previous trailers and promos revealed some Seikret features, the new trailer showcases some neat additions. The Seikret can guide players to their target monster during quests. </p>



<p>Players can also continue to perform essential actions as they would on foot, like healing or gathering. The hook slinger is also allowed while riding around on the Seikret. Further, the mount gives players the ability to “switch between a primary and secondary weapon.” </p>



<p>The Great Sword trailer may not introduce much for existing fans, but it does offer another look at upcoming monsters. Each of Capcom’s new overview trailers feature in-game action.</p>



<p>Capcom <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced</a> Monster Hunter Wilds with a trailer at Summer Game Fest 2024. It still has a broad release window of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-wars-trademark-sega<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has filed a trademark for something called&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars</em>, although it's not clear exactly what that title might refer to.</p>
<p>The trademark listing appears on the Japanese trademark site Chizai Watch (<a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1820278382480802210" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as spotted by Wario64</a>), and while the listing is entirely in Japanese, we can see that it pertains to something simply called&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars</em>&nbsp;and that it was filed by Sega.</p>
<p><em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>is a pretty evocative title, and it could belong to a number of potential games. One user on X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/raiderking__/status/1820279462836994222" rel="noopener" target="_blank">suggests</a> that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could be a <i>Yakuza&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover, while another theorizes that it could be <a href="https://x.com/Rusty_01_91/status/1820280318378528874" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a tactical RPG</a> set in the&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>-slash-<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-wars-trademark-kiwami-2.jpg?itok=a6xmLBuN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-wars-trademark-kiwami-2.jpg?itok=adX_0Iym 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could a tactical&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>spinoff be on the way?</figcaption></figure><p>What's particularly interesting about this trademark is that Sega appears to have opted for the franchise's old Western name,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>, rather than the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>name that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/three-new-like-dragon-games-announced-at-rgg-summit">currently being used both in Japan and in the West</a>.</p>
<p>That might lend some weight to the <i>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</i>crossover theory; after all,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>rolls off the tongue much better than&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em><em>Wars</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Sakura Wars&nbsp;</em>is a Sega franchise.</p>
<p>The name change could, however, simply be a case of Sega covering all eventualities.&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could eventually end up being called&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon Wars</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>could simply be a trademark grab to stop others from using that name.</p>
<p>Given that we don't know much about whatever&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Wars&nbsp;</em>will turn out to be right now, we can only speculate. It's likely we'll have to wait a while for any concrete info about whatever the project turns out to be.</p>

<p>In the meantime, it's all go for the franchise.&nbsp;The latest mainline installment,&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>, is the fastest-selling game in the series, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-has-sold-1-million-copies-fastest-selling-game-in-series">sold a million copies within just a week</a>.

<p>The ‘Basic Mechanics’ video should be familiar territory to anyone that’s dabbled in the monster-mash-to-majestic-merkin pipeline before, although we do get a closer look at the  Seikret - your lizardy mount who can<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo"> carry a second loadout in its pockets</a>. A small addition, but a neat one, is a hook attachment for your wrist-slinger that allows you to collect herbs and such from a distance, as well as bring stalactites down on your foes. You can even use it while mounted.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new additions are stowed away in the <a href="https://youtu.be/_v3lnXyNFhI">Focus Mode</a> trailer. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>’s camera could often be its deadliest nemesis without some menu tweaking, so this new precise aiming mode is very welcome. With focus mode, you’ll be able to better direct your attacks and guards, and highlight monster wounds for increased damage. And, because it’s Monster Hunter, the gradual wounding of the monster as the fight goes on is all fleshy and horrible and brilliantly rendered.</p>
<p>And that’s your lot for now, says Capcom. Don’t blame me, I voted for more. Wait, Edwin has more, you say? He went hands-on with Wilds back in June, and has since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">written a memorial to his dearly departed Alpha Doshaguma</a>. “You absolute fucking bastard, I mouthed at him from across the auditorium, smiling and offering a thumbs-up,” Edwin recalled, in the manner of man who shouldn't be allowed to play any more Monster Hunter so Nic gets all the code when it comes in. “You filthy bear-baiting scumbag. Vengeance! Vengeance for Monsters! Vengeance for the Alpha Doshaguma!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monolith Soft has announced through a post on X that it is hiring new development staff for an upcoming RPG directed by Tetsuya Takahashi, the company’s CCO and Director and the creator of the Xenoblade Chronicles series.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the title besides the genre being “new RPG.” Tetsuya Takahashi stated in a <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/recruit/production/rpg.html">blog post</a> that the “new RPG” will take on newer challenges than the previous Monolith games. They want to expand as “the content to be created is becoming more sophisticated,” interested developers can apply for eight job types, ranging from “asset creation to lead.”</p>



<p>Takahashi further explained that Monolith Soft has created games with a smaller staff. Still, the current situation in the gaming industry requires them to hire more people. For instance, the Xenoblade Chronicles director explained that they cannot use “human wave tactics to produce a large amount of material” for their new RPG and want to “provide an efficient production environment.”</p>



<p>Interested developers can apply for eight job types for Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG, including 2D Designer (artwork staff, Leader Class), 3DCG Designer (character), 3DCG Designer (map), Development Environment Engineer, Field Level Designer, Assistant Director, In-game animator, and Effect Designer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tetsuya Takahashi’s last mainline instalment for Monolith Soft was Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Released in 2023, the title was appreciated by critics and general players. It received a Metascore of 89 and a user score 8.5 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/xenoblade-chronicles-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a modder has added sliding and other movement mechanics to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-sliding-enhanced-movement-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4.</a> Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Season 2 teaser</a> has revealed content beyond the game. What are your thoughts on Monolith Soft’s upcoming RPG by Tetsuya Takahashi? Let us know in the comments.</p>

        <p>"Do I think this is Half-Life 3? I gotta be very careful in answering that question, but yes."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Following yesterday's bombshell news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">Valve <em>could</em> be developing a new Half-Life game</a>, Valve expert Tyler McVicker has stepped forward to say he too believes it's true.</p>
<p>Codenamed "HLX", McVicker asserts the new game "seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game, something that seems too good to be true".</p>
<p><strong>I'll go into some of the details after the video embedded below, but please be mindful there may be spoilers for this new game.</strong></p>

<p>"Almost everything you're about to hear is real, is not speculation, and comes directly from datamines of Valve's recent updates," McVickers says at the start of the video.</p>
<p>"Valve and the team behind Half-Life Alyx started pre-production on another single-player title [around the same time as Half-Life Alyx]. We found out the codename of that title in 2021: HLX.</p>
<p>"There were arguments at the time and in the few following years that HLX wasn't actually representative of a fully-fledged game in development, but maybe could represent an engine feature, or was just a file format for saves.</p>
<p>"In the interim, I have been slowly and silently digging into this story. HLX is a confusing one. HLX seems to be a fully-fledged non-VR Half-Life game, something that seems too good to be true, and something that I wanted to be very sure of before going live with any of this information."</p>
<p>McVicker adds that as "Valve is actively developing many titles on Source" – perhaps most notably "Citadel aka Neon Prime aka Deadlock" – for a while, he couldn't be sure what HLX was.</p>
<p>"Half-Life Alyx was announced almost five year ago, and fully released over four and, as it turns out, that entire time has been spent developing the next major single-player title, codenamed HLX. And now – thanks to a screw up by one of the voice actors on the project – we now know the internal codename that Valve uses to hide the real project name whilst casting voice actors is called Project White Sands."</p>
<p>Interestingly, McVicker points out that, like a lot of studios, Valve uses "very random" codenames, such as "Hot Dog" for Left 4 Dead VR and Left 4 Dead 3, and "Jamiroquai" for Half-Life Alyx. So quite why this one is so candidly associated with the Half-Life series, we're not sure.</p>
<p>McVicker has since "learned a lot" about the project via datamining. According to "strings" inside games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, the character you play as "in whatever HLX is" wears a HEV Suit, and will go "Offworld" where there are "workers", "storks", "pentatanks", "feral man hacks", and "Xengorillas, Xenjellyfish, and Xenswoopers". McVicker reckons these things were initially cut from Half-Life Alyx but have "continued to receive some form of development according to the most recent updates to Valve's Source 2 projects".</p>
<p>"Do I think this is Half-Life 3?" McVicker adds. "I gotta be very careful in answering that question.</p>
<p>"But yes."</p>
<p>Vickers added: "I think this is a non-VR, Half-Life game [in which] you play a HEV Suit-wearing character in development at Valve Software that has been in development since Half-Life Alyx."</p>
<p>The actor's website that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">Project White Sands</a> to the world last night has already been updated to remove the reference.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Larian began a continuation of its work on the beloved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> last year as it was "the obvious thing" to do - before ultimately deciding to change course. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/">PC Gamer</a> on the anniversary of Baldur's Gate 3's full release, Larian boss Swen Vincke said the initial decision to continue working on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based franchise saw his team focus on an obvious follow-up - an idea that sounds like it was initially pitched as an expansion, before being considered as the basis for a potential Baldur's Gate 4. 
</p>
<p>
"It's something that you all would have liked, I think," Vincke said. "I'm sure, actually. And we actually went pretty fast, because the production machine was still warm. You could already play stuff."
</p>
<p>
So why did plans change? Vincke says the idea was initially something the team believed it could get done in a year, as what sounds like an expansion - but then realised it would require much longer.

<p>
"It's going to take two, three years. And having just done six years of D&amp;D, which is not our own thing, are we really going to spend all this time on this and abandon our own plans? Yeah, maybe not for an add-on, but maybe BG4? That makes a lot of sense. So why don't we do it for BG4? Oh, yeah, that sounds like a really good idea. Let's make BG4. All the stuff that we did for this thing, we can just move it in there, people are gonna love it. Go for it."
</p>
<p>
But this then sparked a similar thought process, Vincke continued, with the team considering whether it really did want to continue holding off it's own plans even longer to begin another mammoth D&amp;D game development. After a rethink over the Christmas break, the decision was made to do something different entirely. 
</p>
<p>
"It very rapidly turned, and I don't think, as developers, we ever felt better since we took that decision," Vincke concluded. "Honestly, you really cannot explain or express it, how liberated we are. So morale is super high, just because we're doing new stuff again. We're doing our own thing again, we're not rehashing, we're not trying to convert rules from 50 years ago into something new."
</p>
<p>
Little is known about what Larian is developing next, other than it has two projects in the works, and that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-next-game-likely-early-access-launch-too">considers another early access launch to be likely</a>. We do know, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">definitely isn't Baldur's Gate 4</a> - although that doesn't stop another studio stepping in to make it instead.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-xbox/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Phantom Blade Zero may release on Xbox consoles at some point, as the developer has not ruled out any platform.</p>
<p>In a new statement shared <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1820217285543600590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820248251519627307%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today</a>, the game's developer S-GAME addressed <a href="https://gameplayscassi.com.br/noticias/ninguem-precisa-desta-plataforma-black-myth-wukong-e-phantom-blade-zero-nao-sao-exclusivos-do-playstation-mas-as-versoes-do-xbox-nao-sao-prioridade-dizem-desenvolvedores/82482/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview</a> that's been making the rounds conducted during this year's Chinajoy, where an unnamed developer talked about the low Xbox demand in Asia in very definite terms, saying that this statement does not represent <em>"S-GAME’s values or culture, as we believe in making our game accessible to everyone and have not ruled out any platforms for Phantom Blade Zero."</em> As such, the studio is hard at work on both the development and publishing fronts to ensure that as many players as possible can enjoy the game.</p>
<p>It would be a shame if Phantom Blade Zero ends up skipping Xbox consoles, as the game in development by S-GAMES looks like a great mix of Soulslike and action games, as highlighted by Kai in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-beautiful-and-stylish/">preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>Draped in a bleak and muted aesthetic, the villages and temples of Phantom Blade Zero are secondary to the player character and the multi-faceted combat. The demo opens with a quick tutorial, running through the basics of traversal from jumping, crouching through narrow openings, and sprints before stumbling across a lone enemy that’s the perfect punching bag to serve as a tutorial to the combat. S-Games&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that they don’t want to be considered a Soulslike title. Instead, one of the developers mentioned that they’re bringing back the classic “combo-driven traditional action into a Souls map” and how it’s a fusion of the two archetypes. There’s a cinematic Wuxia style to the combat that will leave players quite surprised as they learn how to take off their Souls blinders and approach Phantom Blade Zero with new eyes.</em></p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero will launch on PC and PlayStation 5 on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-4x-fps/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-will-soon-be-able-to-quadruple-framerate-in-all-pc-games.944751/</guid>

			<p>Lossless Scaling frame generation is about to reach new heights, judging from some new videos shared online in the past few days.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@vyathaen">Vyathaen</a> shared a new video showcasing the 4x FPS mode that will be implemented into the frame generation option of the upscaler in the coming weeks. As a YouTube video isn't the best way to showcase the amazing improvements coming to the frame generation option of the upscaler, those with a Discord account can also join the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2F5cCP6aACgT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lossless Scaling official Discord server</a> to find a Cyberpunk 2077 video that better showcases the 4x FPS mode. According to reports from beta testers, latency is the same as the 2x FPS option, so most games should be perfectly playable with a high enough base framerate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling x4 FPS showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jamkbPaFihs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lossless Scaling has made impressive progress since its release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-2-1-can-now-triple-your-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Version 2.1</a>, which was released in June, introduced a 3x FPS mode that triples framerate, performance optimizations that made the 2x FPS mode faster than in the previous release, and some changes for when the final frame rate exceeds the monitor's refresh rate.</p>
<p>Lossless Scaling is now available for purchase on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. It works with any GPU and every PC game, including emulated games.</p>
