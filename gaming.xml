<p>If you saw the post-credits scene in the original movie, this probably shouldn't come as a surprise. The first movie starred Jack Black as Steve, who was joined by Jason Momoa and a crew of misfits, tasked with saving the Overworld from the Piglin invasion.</p>
<p>A promotional shot has also been shared alongside this announcement, which shows two pickaxe with a purple glow. This has already led to speculation about <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End_(biome)">The End biome</a>, and everything related to it. Jason Hess is also <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/minecraft-2-movie-officially-in-the-works-set-for-summer-2027-release/">confirmed to be heading back</a> to the mines to direct.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067mhrswp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>When the first film made its debut in cinemas earlier this year, it was positively received and ended up becoming a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/minecraft-movie-box-office-success-1236362729/">major box office success</a>. While it's admittedly no cinematic masterpiece, this live-action adventure does a great job recreating the world of Minecraft with all sorts of lore and references to the hugely popular crafting and survival video game.</p>
<p>Mojang even released some free DLC and as well as an in-game event inspired by various "iconic scenes" from the movie.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/gamezone-video-game-journalism-reviews-archives</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamezone-a-website-dating-back-to-1994-has-had-its-archives-wiped.1321456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Old heads or students of games media might remember a site called GameZone, which while never a titan in the industry had managed to survive in one way or another since 1994, enjoying various periods of success throughout, which is an <em>incredible</em> achievement in such a volatile field. Sadly in recent months it appears to have been all but killed off by its owners, with archives spanning decades wiped in favour of front page content that doesn’t feel like it was written by or for human beings.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite appearing long dormant--its featured content for most of 2025, like a PS5 review, was years out of date, its<a href="https://www.facebook.com/gamezone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Facebook page hasn't posted since January 2024</a> and its<a href="https://www.youtube.com/GAMEZONE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> YouTube channel hadn't been updated since 2019</a>--in the early months of this year users could still visit GameZone and access decades of older features and reviews. One of the oldest articles I could find a link for via the Wayback Machine was a review for <em>Tiberian Sun</em>, which came out in 1999!</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looked like in 2005</figcaption></figure><p>This continuity wasn't just a legacy archive for a long-running site and for games media in general, but was also a way for games writers and those who have since moved to other positions in the media and games industries to link back to their old work. If you go searching through the footnotes of Wikipedia, especially for articles on older games, you'll often find GameZone mentioned, whether it's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Def_Jam:_Fight_for_NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Def Jam: Fight for NY</em></a> or<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons:_Hit_%26_Run" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em></a>.</p><p>Luckily those Wikipedia links point to archived copies of those articles, because GameZone's own backlinks are now dead. With the site having been redesigned in the last few months, GameZone has removed the ability to search the site, and its archives now only contain 12 stories, some of which feature AI-generated imagery (like the example below), and many of which are bylined by Javier Lassus, who is a "Solutions Engineer" and web developer at a company called Playwire. Other posts have Louis Barbati's byline, who is also a "Solutions Engineer" at Playwire, and another whose resume has a lot of customer service and web development on it. If someone told me all their posts--with their bullet points, generic text and rambling on about unrelated topics--had also been written by AI, I would not raise either of my eyebrows.</p><p>(I contacted Playwire for comment on this but at time of publishing have not heard back.)</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gabe brought to my attention that GameZone, the website I wrote at for five years and became Editor-in-Chief of, has seemingly erased every article ever written for the site.</p><p>This includes thousands of news articles, reviews, rare interviews, and features I wrote. <a href="https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK">https://t.co/JFqPDt1vtK</a></p></div>— Cade Onder (@Cade_Onder) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cade_Onder/status/1972424612974903752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>I spoke to Gabe Reisinger, a former writer for GameZone, and Cade Onder, its last functional EIC who departed in late 2020, and neither of them say they were given even a courtesy heads-up that years of their work was going to be deleted by the site's owners.</p><p>Playwire,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-coo-for-playwire-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the company that has owned GameZone for years</a>, isn't really a traditional media publisher; they're an ad company, and recently<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7255204402938966017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> celebrated inking a sales deal with the Gamurs network</a>, a<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> group of websites we have covered a few times before</a>. Having left the site (Facebook page aside) long dormant, it’s unclear why Playwire decided to reboot it now, at a time when<a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the prospects for games media websites are as dire as they've ever been</a>, even if the plan is to juice stuff via things like SEO.</p><figure><figcaption>A snapshot of what GameZone looks like in October 2025</figcaption></figure><p>The redesigned site still boasts of its 1994 heritage at the foot of the front page, saying:</p><blockquote><p>Founded in 1994, GameZone has been working to bring gamers everything there is to know about the games industry, from reviews on the latest game releases to breaking news and rumors. In addition to gaming, we bring relevant culture and entertainment news.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>But when I contacted the email tips line right next to that text to ask about the redesign and its content, the email bounced back with an "Address not found" error.</p><p>Look, GameZone wasn't a relevant games media resource in 2025. It hadn't been meaningfully updated in years, and seemed to exist solely to juice some social media accounts with large legacy followings and as an archive for 30 years’ worth of video game journalism. But that last point was important! This is history, of the industry and the medium and of all the work everyone who wrote for GameZone since 1994 had put in, and to have it all just deleted like that without notice doesn't just suck, it should--<a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I've said before</a>--be something that has some consequences.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review"><h3>100 Meters Is A Soulful Gem About The Poetry Of Running</h3></a><p>Studio Rock’N Roll Mountain’s rotoscope take on Uoto’s track manga unearths raw truths and soulful cadence with every thunderous footfall</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gamezone-video-game-journalism-reviews-archives]]></content:encoded>

Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII Remastered are being released together in a “twin-pack” box, while Final Fantasy IX will have a box all its own. All of the games feature some modern conveniences that weren’t available in their initial release. They cost $39.99 each and are now available for preorder at various retailers.</p><p id="final-fantasy-9-switch"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 9 (Switch)">Final Fantasy IX</h2></p><p id="final-fantasy-7-8-remastered"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered ">Final Fantasy VII &amp; VIII Remastered Twin Pack</h2></p><div catalogid="0493e958-f62a-434f-b66f-21a8c2137182" id="229385"><div id="229385" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy 7 &amp; 8 Remastered Twin Pack</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEd16?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0FVGBTNHF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a> - $39.99</li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8DpB?object_uuid=7c2b4a9f-e2be-439b-802d-47e3217b418d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at SE Store</a> - $39.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these games are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-final-fantasy-games-on-nintendo-switch-in-order">already available on Switch</a> (and other platforms) in digital form. But this is the first time they’ll be available in the US in physical form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VII was a major release in 1997, and was the first time the series debuted on a non-Nintendo platform. It follows former SOLDIER Cloud Strife as he and a team of freedom fighters battle against the evil Shinra corporation. This version of the game features 3x speed mode, the ability to turn off random encounters, and “battle enhancement mode.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy VIII Remastered is an enhanced version of a game that hit the PS1 in 1999. It follows Squall and the rest of the members of SeeD as they fight back against the sorceress Edea, who’s causing quite the global ruckus. This version of the game has various battle assist options, a 3x speed boost, and the ability to turn off random encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of its initial release in 2000, Final Fantasy IX was something of a throwback to the medieval-settings settings of the first six entries in the series. This game follows Zidane and a troupe of actors, who “kidnap” Princess Garnet, who secretly wanted to be kidnapped to get away from her deranged mother, the queen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The visuals have been gently revamped to look better on modern displays. It has other new features as well, including auto-save and seven game boosters, including high speed and no-encounter modes.</p></div><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-deluxe-edition-where-to-buy">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Deluxe Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-8-and-9-physical-editions-for-switch-are-up-for-preorder-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy 7, 8, and 9 (Switch) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/100-meters-is-a-soulful-gem-about-the-poetry-of-running.1321411/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, anime has routinely spun athleticism into artistic spectacle, be it ping pong duels, basketball games, or wacky, high-octane races that blur the line between vehicular sport and myth. <em>100 Meters</em>, the latest theatrical release from GKids and Studio <a href="https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-kenji-iwaisawa-director-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock’N Roll Mountain</a>, doesn’t chase flash. Adapted from Uoto’s manga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Meters_(manga)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hyakuemo</em></a>, this rotoscoped-driven gem trades bombast for breadth, offering a quietly powerful and inspiring view of an athlete's ambition fighting underneath the pitfalls of competition, burnout, and career-threatening injury.&nbsp;</p><p>At its core are Togashi, a prodigy whose speed and natural-born athleticism feel God-sent, and Komiya, a scrappy underdog fueled by grit alone. Their friendship-turned-rivalry unfolds across years, framed not by medals or podium envy but by a single refrained question: Why do you run? While the film explicitly answers this question, it never feels like it needs to. It's evident in the way the characters’ bodies move—whether they’re leading the pack, trailing behind chasing glory, or simply chasing each other.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="劇場アニメ『ひゃくえむ。』本編冒頭映像６分特別公開！【大ヒット上映中】" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ObspfdX4jGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a>, <em>100 Meters</em> scratches the itch of watching two people from wildly different walks of life wrestle with maintaining their passion. But where Tatsuki Fujimoto’s work spirals into grief and artistic obsession, <em>100 Meters</em> stays grounded in the purity of the 100-meter dash, a brutally simple sport where runners have just ten seconds to prove they’re the fastest and etch their name into history. If someone’s a hair quicker, or your body fails you, you’re forgotten in the blink of an eye.&nbsp;</p><p>Although <em>100 Meters</em> flirts with the ephemeral glory of being the best in a sport predicated on “who’s on top right now” over who once was, it never wallows in the futility of the Sisyphean pursuit of greatness. Even in its most agonizing defeats and major setbacks, it refuses to become grim. Instead, it finds beauty in the act of picking yourself back up and starting again—to compete not for legacy, but for love. For the joy of movement, and to run shoulder to shoulder with the like-minded people beside you.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes <em>100 Meters</em> truly magnificent is how, despite being about track and field, it refuses to embellish or exaggerate its modest place in sports. The stands aren’t packed; races aren’t roared over outside of the confines of its niche fandom. The sport isn’t the celestial body around which the universe revolves. It’s just something that <em>100 Meters</em>’ characters collectively chose.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Rock'N Roll Mountain/GKids</span></figcaption></figure><p>Visually, <em>100 Meters’</em> rotoscope animation—arguably the biggest selling point— is sublime. With herculean production feats like a three-minute and 40-second one-shot long take totaling <a href="https://x.com/ROCKNROLL_MT/status/1970718588081189235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 9,830 animation cels</a> across foreground and background layers, Rock’N Roll’s craftsmanship is undeniable. But its rotoscoping truly sings in the film’s quieter moments. Subtle gestures, flickers of emotion, and the rhythmic ebb and flow of movement—both in anguish and elation—are illustrated with painterly grace.&nbsp;</p><p>Complementing this is the film’s soft watercolor background art, where every brushstroke and stain evokes the cozy tactility of a Little Golden Book, tying its visual poetry together with warmth and texture. A texture that erupts from the frame with rapturous adrenaline as its ensemble hits its eighth gear, diving headlong into their runner’s high to finish out strong with primal ferocity.&nbsp;</p><p><em>100 Meters</em> doesn’t grandstand. It just runs. And in doing so, it discovers something achingly beautiful and universal in the blur of its poetry.</p><hr><p><em>100 Meters hits</em> select theaters on October 10 and will be available nationwide from October 12 to October 14.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange"><h3>Baby Steps’ Manbreaker Did Not Break Me</h3></a><p>Baby Steps' Manbreaker is an optional, brutal challenge that is as much a test of your humility as it is your skill.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/skin-deep-patch-notes-impaled-swordfishes"><h3>Good Patch Notes</h3></a><p>"The trash chute now ignores impaled swordfishes"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/100-meters-gkids-anime-movie-review]]></content:encoded>

These originally launched in Japan and Europe a few years ago, but US fans were stuck with digital versions on the eShop. While you could import and play the physical versions from other regions thanks to the Switch's region-free hardware, these new US releases will (hopefully) be easier to find when they launch on December 9. Preorders for both games are now live at Amazon for $40 each. While there are no preorder bonuses announced at this time, it's still worth securing early copies, since physical Final Fantasy Switch releases tend to be very popular.</p><p dir="ltr">All three games offer the same core experience as the original PS1 RPGs, but with HD graphics and higher resolution presentation. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered in particular features new character models that are more detailed than the PS1's--though they still resemble the PS1's 3D models' art direction, and use the original animations, so it's not a <em>huge</em> change. All three games also feature optional toggles to turn off random encounters, make your characters invincible, and more. While these are Switch games, you can of course play them on Switch 2 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">With these new Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack and Final Fantasy IX physical releases, it's now possible to grab physical editions of almost every mainline Final Fantasy game--plus some of its best spinoffs--on Switch. The first six entries in the series are all included in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a>, and the Switch version is on sale for $69 (was $75). Though if you're looking for the best deal, it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available on PS4</a> for just $53. The pixel remaster versions of these games maintain the classic 2D gameplay of the NES and SNES RPGs, but feature new pixel art (and not the ugly redrawn sprites of the mobile re-releases from a few years ago), as well as other tweaks like the ability to play with the original chiptune soundtracks or new orchestrated versions, optional battle speed and difficulty settings, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For the later entries in the series, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster</a>, which includes Final Fantasy X and its sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. These versions feature upscaled graphics, orchestrated soundtracks, and the extra content from the International Editions of both games, including the roguelike mystery dungeon-style bonus game FFX-2: Last Mission. The CG short Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm--which bridges X and X-2--and the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will are also included in the collection. The Switch edition is on sale for just $25 (was $50).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is available on Nintendo's handhelds via the Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age edition. This re-release of the PS2 RPG includes similar features as many of the other Final Fantasy remasters, including upscaled graphics, a re-recorded soundtrack, and battlespeed modifiers, plus all the bonus content and gameplay changes from the PS2's International Edition that was left out of the US release--including the excellent new Job System that adds welcome variety to how you build your party.

Both Final Fantasy X/X2 HD and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age are being sold and shipped by Amazon, which we assume means Square Enix recently reprinted both games, since previously it was only available from third-party sellers. It's also surprising that both games are just $25, given that the eShop versions are $50 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, the fictional world created by the beloved spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics, which recently saw its own high-quality remaster in the form of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. This version includes the option to play with the original PS1 graphics, or the newly remastered version with higher resolution graphics, voice-acted dialog, an overhauled UI, and other changes. The Switch version is available in a $50 Amazon-exclusive physical edition that includes the game and a bonus fold-out poster, as well as a free Switch 2 Upgrade.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Physical Final Fantasy Switch and Switch 2 Games</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Switch)</a> -- $69 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX HD (Switch)</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Amazon Exclusive Edition (Switch)</a> -- $50 | Switch 2 upgrade included</li></ul><p dir="ltr">That leaves Final Fantasy XI Online, Final Fantasy XIV Online, the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, Final Fantasy XV, and Final Fantasy XVI as the last numbered entries in the series not playable on Nintendo's handhelds.

You'll also find other Final Fantasy spin-offs like World of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles HD, and Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon on the eShop as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the Switch 2 still has some big Final Fantasy releases headed its way. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</a> launches on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and preorders are available for $50 at Amazon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few short days ago, Epictellers launched a Kickstarter campaign for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>. The campaign promises an in-depth cRPG videogame adaptation of Paizo's spacefaring TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder</em></a>. A project that is off to a strong start, raising over $400,000.</p>



<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> is an exciting turn-based, narrative-rich, RPG set in the world of Starfinder. The game will center on your custom character and the crew of your own spaceship as you explore the Pact Worlds. The game will feature branching narratives based on your choices, romanceable crew members, and a 40+ hour main story experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=-j5qec7z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=aRmoxMLa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That is quite a lot of material to promise for a Kickstarter. But, the campaign prefaces this by stating the game has been in development for a while. It has already spent a year in pre-production, onboarding developers and voice-actors. Additionally, a development pipeline is in place, with the game set to release in Early Access at the start of 2026, followed by a full release in 2027.</p>

<p>As for the voice-actors confirmed for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em>, they contain some fantastic industry staples. Big names like Fred Tatasciore, Carolina Ravassa, and Imel Tomlinson are confirmed as major crewmates. But the biggest head turner is the inclusion of voice-actor and voice director of the game is Neil Newbon, most well known for the roguish vampire Astarion in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A second major selling point for the game is on the gameplay side. The game would not just be a turn-based RPG, but one built on the ruleset and mechanics of <em>Starfinder: Second Edition</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-crewmate-artwork.jpg?itok=IsxjHF-M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starfinder-afterlight-crewmate-artwork.jpg?itok=TYQpbA71 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With both of these selling points in mind, it is clear that <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> is following in the steps of Larian Studios' masterpiece. While other games like Owlcat's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</em></a> have done well, this is the first time a game has tried to adapt Paizo's system into a videogame.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Akitonian Merchant for $41:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special Akitonian in-game dice, and Kickstarter-exclusive digital wallpaper</li>
	<li><strong>Member of the Starfinder Society for $70:</strong> A digital PC copy of the game (Steam), special in-game Starfinder Society items, a digital art book and soundtrack</li>
	<li><strong>Khali's Crew for $105:</strong> Everything in the Member of the Starfinder Society tier, and Khali's Dawn in-game items, and closed beta access</li>
	<li><strong>Complete Edition for $175:</strong> Everything in the Khali's Crew tier, STL files for companions and villains, sacred larva in-game dice, and PDFs of Starfinder Second Edition&nbsp;</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, <em>Starfinder: Afterlight</em> has raised&nbsp;$444,016, more than five times its initial funding goal of $<span><span><span>87,336. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the project, which include new playable ancestries like the Skittermander and Pahtras, as well as full voice-acting for all sidequests. The campaign ends on November 8.</span></span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-roster-expands-with-cecil-story-mode-teases-arrival-of-brand-new-character-who-hasnt-yet-appeared-anywhere-in-the-invincible-universe">Invincible VS just announced its eighth playable character: Cecil</a>. The no-nonsense director of the Global Defense Agency is a surprise addition to the roster. He lacks any superpowers, so it’s hard to imagine him lasting more than a blink of an eye against the likes of Omni-Man and co. But Invincible creator Robert Kirkman was adamant Cecil be in the game, and left it to the developers at Quarter Up to figure out how to make him work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their answer is to lean on all the cool gadgets we see Cecil use in Invincible, which in this 3v3 tag fighting game levels the playing field somewhat. But there’s more: Invincible VS has a sizeable Story Mode in which Cecil plays a crucial role. Kirkman and Quarter Up won’t say much about it, but they describe is as a “playable episode,” so expectations are high.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In this interview with IGN, Kirkman, Invincible VS executive producer Mike Willette, art director Dan Eder, and narrative director Mike Rogers, talk as much about Story Mode as they are allowed to right now, and delve deep into how Cecil actually works in the game. Read on to find out if Invincible VS is canon to the show, details on Cecil's kit, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: It must have been an interesting challenge with Cecil. He doesn’t have any superpowers, but he’s smart and can teleport and uses a lot of weapons. So how did you go about making him work in a fighting game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> From a lore and narrative perspective, Cecil's always in control. We often see him as the man in the ear or the man watching the screen, but people forget that he's a trained agent. He knows how to get his hands dirty and he's got all the tech and all the money of the U.S. government behind him that can allow him to do that. There's just a lot of cool things that we've got in there that allow Cecil to be a really different character. We wanted him in there. There was no way we wanted to exclude him. And we saw opportunities like using his teleporter, like using Reanimen, like using The White Room, to get him in there in a unique way that people might not expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> From a gameplay perspective, you have all these different types of archetypes, and where Cecil really fits in, in a really unique fashion in our system, is manipulating space, almost like he manipulates people, right? So the ability to put out projectiles like his Sonic Mine, that will basically just hover in space and then detonate after a few seconds. So he can put hazards, put roadblocks, put almost like a bullet hell for the opponent to try to get through. And because of our active tag system, he connects one time, he can tag in one of his assists. And so he's got a lot of utility for just manipulating the screen, getting around it, pelting the opponent from afar, making it frustrating for them, and then putting him back into our combo system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So is he a zoner, would you say?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So his combo structure, while he does have auto combos like most of our characters, and the magic chain of light, mediums and heavies, he has a lot of utility for the mid and the long range. He can make people try to chase him down. He has a lot of boosted moves that can cause pop-up or hard knockdown. Or for his… we call it Shellhock, he goes down with a Flaxan weapon and he basically launches like a grenade, but when you boost it you can launch multiples. You can do it</p><p data-cy="paragraph">while retreating and try to fill the screen and try to just set up roadblocks, so you can kind of like reset and then continue to pelt from afar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So he can manipulate a lot more than other characters can, because he has to use these tools. He doesn't have an air dash. He doesn't have double jumps. He uses the teleportation a lot to make those old bones work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/gettyimages-2197035483-1760010568385.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Robert Kirkman is heavily involved with the development of Invincible VS. Photo by Michael Buckner/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Robert, I'd love to know what your input was on this. He’s not the obvious choice for a fighting game when you look at the characters in Invincible. I'm sure fans will love that he's in there. Was he a character you were keen to see realized in a fighting game particularly? How did it come to be that he was in the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> His presence in the game is something that's really exciting for me because it shows the versatility of what these guys are trying to accomplish with the game, by having characters that you wouldn't expect and working out how Cecil can be equally matched with all the other people that are coming into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really great the way they're pulling in story elements. There's a lot of character that is intact from the comics and the show that is clear in every frame of these characters. Cecil actually puts his hands in his pockets when he moves backwards, which to me was something that I thought was just absolutely brilliant. And it's just a really fun aspect of the character that's there visually as he's moving around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's definitely a wish list of characters that I wanted in the game. And Cecil was one where I thought it would be really cool and unexpected if he were to show up in the game. Never in a million years did I think they would be able to pull it off and pull it off this well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm gonna tease too much… I'm going to get in trouble, I can't say anything! But I'm very excited about this game!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to ask you about the story and the story mode. I don't know if that's something that you can talk about at this stage, but it'd be great to get some input on the narrative side of things, because I do understand that you're going big on that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> I've been working very closely with Mike Rogers, the narrative lead, and Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the series. She wrote the Adam Eve special episode with me and has done a lot of great episodes for the show. What we're really trying to do is provide an in-game experience that is like watching an episode of the television show. It’s a really cool story that uses the characters in a really exciting and authentic way, and I think goes into some directions that people are really going to be surprised by. There's a lot of unexpected twists and turns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> We wanted it to feel like a playable episode. It's this standalone narrative. In the same vein that the Adam Eve special is like a special episode, this is a special episode, too. And just getting to work with Robert and Helen and really craft something that feels right for the Invincible universe, it's been a real treat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is this canon, or is it like a What If? sort of scenario? I know it's an original story, so it's not something we've seen before. But, you know the fans will wonder how it all ties in with everything. They always do. I mean, I do! So what do we actually have here?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Robert Kirkman:</strong> It definitely fits very neatly into the narrative of the show. There's a tremendous level of care going into making sure that the characters are authentic and that everything works. Internally, there's actually a window where we're like, ‘Yeah, could fit there.’ But, you know, we're not going to talk about that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willlette:</strong> Just sit back and enjoy yourself!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/09/lineup-1760010430186.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Eight characters are now confirmed for Invincible VS.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You’ve got Cecil going up against Omni-Man, for example, which on the face of it would be impossible. But as designers of a fighting game, how do you balance everything where that can be a valid matchup, even though you would think that Omni-Man would essentially tear everyone to shreds?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> What's so awesome about just jumping right into this universe, there's so much deep lore and personality with these characters and things to pull from, from like all that comic resource. And then you have the show. And it's kind of the rule of cool, what makes this character and what's really fun for gameplay? And then merging these ideas together. And then you get to see what archetypes do they fit within or it's like, are they rushed down? Are they a grappler, are they strikers? Are they long range? You have this kind of triangle and then you're like, ‘Oh, do they fit more along these two aspects or these two?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then things just naturally start to fall in place, and especially within the meta that we've created of like, it's not just a single character, it's three characters that actually represent your kit. So you get to mix and match all these different things. I want to play pure keep away, or I want to have something that's a little bit more balanced where I do have a big bully who can push the corners and then I support that character with a bunch of ranged or mid-range characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when it comes down to balance, it's really just seeing what's the essence of the character, what belongs in their kit, and then how it works within our omni tag system, how do characters play well with each other or support each other, whether it's through the assist systems and the different types of assists that they can have, or how they naturally tag into each other. You can play almost any character like a point character or have it dedicated for a very specific role. It's really play the way that you want. And again, we're just given this beautiful sandbox by Robert and company that's just like, God, we have so much great source material. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> I will say one of the challenges of using an established IP is that you have to find the middle ground between being authentic to the IP but also making a fighting game that's gonna work. If you're authentic to the quote unquote power levels of the show, then that wouldn't be a very satisfying experience because it just wouldn't be very balanced. And if you know anything about fighting games, it’s that balance is key. We do want to allow people to be able to play with their favorite character and not be completely demolished just because the other one is so OP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think as long as you're authentic to the character and there's some sort of plausibility of, okay, that character would use those powers, right? Then I think a lot of it comes down to pure skill of whoever is playing that character. And that's how you stay true to the source material, but also just make it stand on its own. Because I think the reality is that not everyone is going to be intimately familiar with Invincible. We don't want to make this game just for the fans. We want to make this game for people who may not be aware of Invincible, and this would be their starting point. So then that wouldn't matter as much to them. ‘Hey, why is Omni-Man so…’</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> We're gonna turn them into fans, Dan!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dan Eder:</strong> Exactly. So I think there's a big opportunity to do our own thing, make the game stand on its own, without relying on the fandom, but also make it very pleasing for the fans. At the end of the day we're gonna have a lot of Easter eggs, we're gonna have a lot of small touches and character moments as much as we can. And I think it's gonna be an all around great experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Rogers:</strong> And Cecil was a character where we got to think about this also. Every character has a round reset in between rounds of the fight where they fly at each other, their fists smash and like, okay, if Omni-Man's fist is smashing into Cecil's, that's not gonna end well for Cecil, but he's got these Reanimen and can jump in and do that for him. He's got the teleporter that can allow him to dash around, sort of in the way he has a conversation with Nolan at the end of Season 1. And we got to interpret that and bring those into like, how do they work in a fighting game? And I think it brought an extra level of authenticity to the character. And that challenge for a character like Cecil yields more specificity, which is great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did all you fighting game developers all over the world get together one day and decide 2026 was going to see the return of tag fighters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> It's the most insane thing — and it's true — that all great minds think alike! Because we haven't seen a really awesome tag battle fighting game since like Dragon Ball Fighterz, and that's like, what? Eight years now. And then before that, the gold standard was Marvel vs. Capcom. So there was this huge void. And we all approached it differently. Our competitors are different from us. And that's actually a really good thing. And it's interesting, everyone has their own take, and we really like our take. We really like the universe that we get to play in, and we like the violence of it, the brutality of the stakes that are involved, and our unique style of combat and what it means to read someone — you read your opponent and be able to have large amounts of counterplay. Yeah, it's an exciting time. 2026 is crazy!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was a tag fighter right for you? And then 3v3?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mike Willette:</strong> Obviously being a huge fan of the comics in the show, when I was asked like, ‘Hey, Mike,  what game do you want to do?’ I'm like, ‘I want to do an Invincible tag battle fighting game.’ There's so many factions and teams that exist within the universe, whether it's like the Teen Team or The Guardians or The Lizard League or The Order, like there's just so many. And when you watch people fight, like yeah, there's solo fights, but there's also a lot of team fighting that takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been this lack of team fighter games for such a long period of time. And then this IP had lots of strengths when it came to teams and team synergy, and I always thought about the ideas of like, what happens when these characters team up and do shit together? Like when Eve and Mark fight together, how awesome is that? So we just wanted to play out those fantasies, and what better method than in a fighting game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-wanted-it-to-feel-like-a-playable-episode-robert-kirman-and-the-developers-of-invincible-vs-talk-about-its-mysterious-story-mode-and-making-cecil-work-in-a-fighting-game">IGN's interview with Kirkman and the developers at Quarter Up to find out more about how Cecil works and the Invincible VS story mode</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cecil’s announcement means we now know of eight playable characters in Invincible VS, voiced by the actors who play those characters in the hugely popular Prime Video animated series. They are Mark Grayson (Invincible), Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, Battle Beast, Omni-Man, and now also Cecil.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb on Cecil:</p><blockquote>A fan-favorite from the Invincible TV series and comic books, Cecil has been one of the most requested playable characters. Most often heard as a voice in Mark’s earpiece, Cecil enters the fight in Invincible VS with specialized weapons, including plasma pistols, projectile launchers and grenades to keep opponents at a distance. His ranged gameplay style is paired with tactical combat, allowing him to play cat and mouse with enemies. Want more? Cecil can also summon a limitless supply of Reanimen for backup; with access to The Hammer — a massive orbital laser — he is a devastating force on the battlefield.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Quarter Up talked more about the Invincible VS Story Mode, which is a standalone narrative set in the Invincible universe. It’s written by Invincible TV show co-executive producer and writer Helen Leigh and Invincible VS narrative director Mike Rogers, in collaboration with Kirkman. Expect over 25 minutes of bespoke animation in the Story Mode, which “plays like a special extended episode of the show,” featuring every announced playable character so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the Story Mode teases the arrival of a brand-new character who hasn’t yet appeared anywhere in the Invincible Universe. Quarter Up wouldn’t say who, but did confirm Cecil plays a pivotal role in the story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS Cecil Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Invincible has always been as much about  compelling storytelling as it is about bloody beatdowns and fights you can’t tear your eyes from,” said Kirkman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was really important to me that we capture the essence of both the comic and television series, and bring key characters into the game. With Story Mode, our hope is that fans feel like they are right back in the show, but experiencing the universe in a whole new way.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible VS will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Players can register for an upcoming Invincible VS Closed Alpha later this year here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>For gamers of a certain age, gibberish character sequences like <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/pageofdoom/cheat.html">idkfa</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/simcity-2000/cheats/">torg</a>, <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/genesis/563332-mortal-kombat/cheats">ABACABB</a>, and <a href="https://konami.fandom.com/wiki/Konami_Code">UUDDLRLRBA</a> are akin to long-lost magical incantations. They evoke an era where game developers frequently and routinely let players use cheat codes to customize their gameplay experience with everything from infinite health and instant level selection to <a href="https://tcrf.net/Help:Contents/Terminology/Debug_Mode">full debug menus</a> or <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigHeadMode">gigantic anime-style giant-headed avatars</a>. There were even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/how-the-new-game-genie-lets-you-hack-your-ps3-saves/">external cheat devices</a> that let players hack console games with cheat codes the developers never intended.</p>
<p>While the cheat code's heyday is long in the past, the idea of letting players manipulate their gameplay experiences in similar ways is coming back into fashion for some developers. Last month, Square Enix <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1966521540130009578">announced</a> that upcoming Switch 2 and Xbox ports of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> would include new "streamlined progression" features. As the name implies, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1nlcmn8/streamlined_progression/">new options menu</a> will give players the opportunity to blaze through the game with infinite health, magic, and money, quicker leveling, maximum damage attacks, and more.</p>

<p>While some responded negatively to what they derisively called a "cheat mode," director Naoki Hamaguchi defended the new options <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-boosts-and-sped-up-cutscenes-can-reduce-playtime-to-under-10-hours-director-hamaguchi-tells-us-why/">in a recent interview with Automaton</a>. "Personally, I like to try many different games just to keep myself up to date, but I don’t really have the time, so I only get so far," he said. "I personally believe that, with digital entertainment today, the player should have the choice in how they interact with content. That’s why I pushed for it."</p>
<p>He's right. Players are responsible enough to know if, when, and how to use these kinds of options to help streamline their progress through a game. At the same time, I think many games would benefit from hiding these kinds of gameplay-altering options behind the obscurity of old-fashioned cheat codes, rather than tempting built-in menus.</p>

<h2>Developer intent</h2>
<p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> is far from the first modern game to offer players a simple option for friction-free progress. In <em>Mass Effect 3</em> it's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/">Narrative Mode</a>. In <em>Nier Automata</em> it's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2016/09/19/nier-automata-auto-mode-lets-the-ai-do-the-fighting-for-you/">Auto Mode</a>. In <em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em> it's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/discovery-tour-lets-you-explore-assassins-creed-origins-combat-free/">Discovery Mode</a>. In <em>Death Stranding</em> it's just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/every-game-should-copy-death-strandings-very-easy-mode/">Very Easy Mode</a>. In a game like <em>Celeste</em> it's <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/celeste-difficulty-assist-mode/">a whole menu of accessibility options</a> that allow for fine-tuning of the game's precision platforming rules.</p>
<p>In each case, there's a recognition that some players might want to explore a game's world—to experience the characters, art, and dialogue that the developers worked so hard to craft—without struggling through mechanical reflex tests or grindy, repetitive challenges. Even players who enjoy the "intended" difficulty most of the time might want to treat the game like a giant sandbox on subsequent playthroughs, or quickly skip to their favorite part when revisiting years later.</p>
<p>As Penny Arcade <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/news/post/2005/05/16/we-are-so-very-proud-of-you">memorably put it back in 2005</a>: "I play games to enter a trance state and experience other lives, [others] play them to defeat the designer of the game by proxy. That’s a significant distinction."</p>
<p>But there are some games where this kind of built-in difficulty manipulation would be antithetical to a game's very nature. In <em>Baby Steps</em> for example, struggling with the game's controls and suffering when you lose significant progress to an errant step <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/baby-steps-is-the-most-gloriously-frustrating-game-ive-ever-struggled-through/">is very much the point</a>.</p>

              A "perfect balance" toggle would completely ruin the impact of this <em>Baby Steps</em> moment.

<p>A version of <em>Baby Steps</em> where you could plow through to the end with perfect balance or frequent save points would ruin the experience in some crucial ways. Just offering this kind of "Exploration Mode" in the options menu would undercut the message the developers are trying to impart, giving players an easy out in a game where those don't and shouldn't exist.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>FF7 Remake</em>'s Hamaguchi acknowledged a similar issue in discussing why he wouldn't initially offer "streamlined progression" options for the upcoming third game in the remake series. "If we were to add it to the third installment at launch, it would probably spark controversy," Hamaguchi said. "We’d risk disrupting the experience for fans who have been waiting the longest and deserve to enjoy it the most (through spoilers coming out early and similar)."</p>
<p>This is where I think the added friction of the old-fashioned cheat code can come in handy. While a tempting "easy mode" menu option can weaken the impact of a game's "intended" design, a hidden cheat code is much more clearly set apart as an unrelated option intended for tinkerers and fun-seekers.</p>

<h2>Making “easy mode” harder to find</h2>
<p>The difference comes down to context. Back in the day, players usually found cheat codes from a source outside of the game itself, passing around the arcane knowledge through online forums, printed magazines, or schoolyard rumors. That outside sourcing made it clear that, while these codes were obviously part of the game in a sense, they were also somehow separate from the core gameplay experience. Even the term "cheat code" connotes the idea that you're getting away with something by evading the game's built-in rules.</p>

<p>An ever-present "god mode" toggle or "accessibility" menu, on the other hand, presents those options as contextually valid and at least somewhat intended ways for different players to experience the same base game. And that's perfectly fine in many cases; as Hamaguchi pointed out, sometimes players will just want to experience the story as quickly as possible. But in games where the difficulty is integral to the developer's intent, putting that kind of option upfront can confuse the message and confuse the player as to which is the most "correct" way to play.</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<p>Toggling an "easy mode" through a menu is like flipping a light switch that the developers left invitingly available in a little-used corner of the house. Tracking down a cheat code, on the other hand, feels more like going to the hardware store and asking for help to install your own light switch. The effect is the same, but the path to get there makes all the difference.</p>
<p>In modern PC gaming, mods often offer that same kind of context change. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/babysteps/mods/2">This fanmade <em>Baby Steps</em> mod</a> offers the ability to fly to any location and save at any time, completely ruining the game as it was designed. But players that go to the trouble of seeking out, downloading, and installing that mod obviously have no one to blame for that bastardization but themselves.</p>

<p>Cheat codes also offer developers additional options for how and when they present new options to players. In <em>UFO 50</em>, for instance, players can discover many of <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/215407-ufo-50/cheats">the game's gameplay-altering Terminal Codes</a> by beating a subgame and watching the credits. Even outside the game, a developer can keep a cheat code's very existence hidden for months <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/decades-later-players-are-still-unlocking-secrets-in-classic-mortal-kombat/">or even years</a> after a game's launch, ensuring that early adopters experience the game as designed (this happened all the time in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/11/final-nintendo-power-cover-brings-the-magazine-full-circle/">the pre-Internet era of game magazines</a>).</p>
<p>Trying to bring back that era of hidden knowledge might seem silly in an age where Internet sleuths are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-datamining-has-changed-the-landscape-of-video-game-puzzle-and-secret-design">data-mining games before they even come out</a>. But I still think that a revival of the humble video game cheat code can help offer fun and helpful gameplay options for those who want them while protecting the intent of today's video game designers.</p>

<p>The Ninja Gaiden 4 release is quickly approaching, allowing players to download the game ahead of launch, and the preload and file size are available now.</p>



<p>If you have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-ninja-gaiden-4-pre-order-bonuses-amp-editions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-ordered the game</a>, you are just about ready to go, but to make sure you can play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the moment that it’s available</a>, you should get the download out of the way now.</p>



<p>Here is a preload guide for Ninja Gaiden 4 and the pre-launch file size on each platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-can-you-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">When Can You Preload Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The wait is almost over. Image by Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Preloads for Ninja Gaiden 4 are currently available on PC via the Windows Store and Xbox Series X|S. As of this writing, PlayStation 5 and Steam players will have to wait just a little longer before they can start downloading the game.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, we do not have a confirmed date or time that Steam and PlayStation will allow players to start the <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/ng4/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> preload. The release date is set for October 21, so you should expect it to be available any day now.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-file-size-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 File Size Explained</h2>



<p><strong>As of pre-launch, the Ninja Gaiden 4 file size sits at 54.9 GB on PC through the Windows Store, 36.82 GB on Xbox Series X, and 23.55 GB on PlayStation 5. Steam players can probably expect a similar file size to the Windows Store version.</strong></p>



<p>As is pretty usual, the file size on PC is larger because the game has to account for a larger variety of hardware that will be running the game, a lot of which is stronger than you see in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. With that said, the PlayStation 5 version being less than half of the PC version is definitely a testament to the compression work in that version.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that these file sizes are for the game ahead of launch. If there is a day-one patch or update, who knows how much the file sizes could jump up.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-preload-ninja-gaiden-4">How to Preload Ninja Gaiden 4</h2>



<p><strong>To preload Ninja Gaiden 4, you will have to pre-order the game digitally through any of the supported platforms. Anyone looking to get the game physically will have to wait until release, when they have the disc in hand.</strong></p>



<p>If you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-ninja-gaiden-4-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the game now</a>, there should be an option at checkout to start downloading the game immediately. If you have preordered previously, look in your owned games library for the option to start downloading. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> can go to the Game Pass app and search for the game to find the pre-install option.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Ever since Ghostface appeared in Call of Duty years ago, I've been impatiently waiting for my favorite horror icon to arrive in my favorite multiplayer game. I knew it was just a matter of time, and thankfully that time is now. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnitemares-2025-all-skins-weapons-and-new-map/2900-7125/" data-ref-id="2900-7125">Fortnitemares 2025</a> adds Ghostface among so many other crossovers, like Scooby-Doo, Terrifier's Art the Clown, indie horror hits REPO and Poppy Playtime, and more, to Fortnite. But not all of these collabs got the same treatment, and even cooler than the upcoming Ghostface skin is the new Scream-inspired weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">In Fortnite's latest Halloween event, you can find the new Last Call weapon inspired by Scream's legendary slasher. The weapon is more like a set of features; it's a knife with attached movement abilities, voice lines, and, when equipped, a full Ghostface costume. Unlike the Scooby Snacks or Doja Cat's Thorn Ripper, which are both fun but also reskins of pre-existing items, the Last Call isn't quite like anything the game has included before, and as a huge fan of Scream, I think Epic absolutely nailed the design.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582880" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582880"></a><figcaption>The slasher GOAT arrives in Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4582880-g2zeihww4aaj1gp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First, there's how you acquire it. You can't pick up the Last Call knife in chests or find it as floor loot. Instead, you have to visit a phone booth. Stepping into the phone booth briefly, you emerge dressed as Ghostface, and you'll switch out of the all-black costume and iconic white mask whenever you unequip the knife, which taps into Scream's long list of killers claiming the role of Ghostface over the years.</p><p dir="ltr">It was pretty funny, I admit, when I was already playing as Michael Myers and switched between Carpenter and Craven with the press of a button, but I love how this subtle aesthetic choice captures an important facet of the Scream series--not to mention it gives some folks the chance to run around as Ghostface even if they haven't bought the skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, there are the Last Call's special features. While wielding it, you'll run faster. Speed has always been something that separates Ghostface from most other slashers. Where the likes of Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers slowly walk toward their prey--and that can be scary in its own right, no doubt--Ghostface sprints. Epic was wise to pair the knife with the movement speed buff to really capture the killer's vibe.</p><p dir="ltr">The finishing touch that I adore is the phone call element tied to the item. The knife includes an ability to "call" others on the map, which in gameplay terms plays out as pinging anyone within the item's radius whenever you use the ability between cooldowns. A phone ringing is the first thing we ever hear in the Scream series, and the voice of Roger L. Jackson taunting victims about their favorite scary movies and stalking them while in hiding is as integral to the series as the mask itself.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:f7h45eshrvbthfo3l445uej7/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2rxomnvss2u" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiabv53ovjynfsyhimakdgwgqvwndvju6j3jvyzyiu5lodn36zialq" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>Fortnite’s Ghostface weapon, the Last Call knife, includes a costume switch, a phone that calls and pings nearby enemies, faster movement, and voice lines (a bit buried here beneath pumpkin launcher noises).

  </div><p dir="ltr">In Fortnite, each time you pick up the knife from a phone booth, you'll hear Ghostface--and it does seem to be Jackson reprising his role--bark out a voice line. When you successfully ping someone nearby with the calling ability, he'll speak again. I've heard several different phrases in just a few rounds with the Last Call. These features give the knife a role-playing element thanks to how each aspect taps into the character's almost 30-year history.</p><p dir="ltr">Being such a big Scream fan, I'm already making a point to not just grab a Last Call every round, but I've even been playing with just this knife (and some movement items and heals, of course). Sure, Ghostface briefly uses a shotgun in Scream 6, but I'm having a blast role-playing as my favorite horror movie's starring villain in my knife-only matches. There's even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnitemares-quests-2025-how-to-get-a-free-fortnite-skin-and-all-rewards/1100-6535338/" data-ref-id="1100-6535338">Fortnitemares quest</a> to use it on seven different players.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic consistently adds cool, inventive new items to Fortnite every season, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised how awesome the Ghostface crossover has become, but <em>this </em>level of thoughtfulness in the design of a weapon has often been reserved for the many major Star Wars and Marvel collabs. As someone who doesn't feel anything for those series, but who loves Scream so much that I have a Ghostface tattoo, it's so exciting to be on the receiving end of Fortnite's latest extra-mile effort.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I visited Skybound Entertainment to get my hands on Invincible VS ahead of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/08/invincible-vs-is-a-3v3-fighting-game-based-on-the-popular-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91fb3df8-0241-4798-aabd-183a5eb737c6" data-entity-substitution="canonical">its June reveal</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/06/10/a-faithfully-bloody-adaptation">I emerged impressed</a> by the technical proficiency and over-the-top action the 3v3 fighter delivers within a product that feels genuine to the source material. And it makes sense, seeing as how the team is made up of writers, artists, and talent involved with the show and comic, as well as developers who previously worked on the Killer Instinct reboot. As the roster continues to build out, with the director of the Global Defense Agency, Cecil Stedman, this tag-team fighting game is looking to be more and more of a dream project for fans of the series like myself.</p><p>Though I didn't get my hands on Cecil's gameplay like I did with Invincible, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, and Thula back in May, I was given an advance screening of a gameplay trailer. Cecil looks surprisingly technical, with a lot of devices, teleportation, and even summoned ReAnimen mixed into his gameplay style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It would have been really easy for us to just have him be a 'Man in the Ear,' but we wanted to do something more than that," narrative director Michael Rogers says. "Cecil is a fan favorite of a lot of people on the team, myself included, and the way we figured it out was just being inventive. I had a wishlist of things that I wanted in the game from a story perspective, and that was teleportation, the White Room, ReAnimen, and all of those things were things that our combat designers already had on their brain."</p><p>Cecil joins a roster that already includes Invincible, Omni-Man, Atom Eve, Bulletproof, Thula, Rex Splode, and Battle Beast. If you're a fan of Invincible, you'll pretty quickly realize that Cecil is the first character without superpowers. "If you look at it from a gameplay perspective, you have all these different archetypes from grapplers to strikers to rush-down powerhouse characters that push you to corners, and then you have mid- and long-range characters," executive producer Mike Willette says. "The concept of Cecil, what he does is he manipulates and he can stay on the outside. So, in his kit, we have a lot of long-range weaponry, from his GDA tech, like his sonic mine, to the ReAnimen that he can call in, to the White Room, the orbital strike, the Flaxan weapons; he has all this stuff available to him. So, for him, he's just setting up the battlefield. He's setting up traps and things that you have to get around. [...] He can't fly, he doesn't have a double-jump, so he takes advantage of his GDA tech and costing the taxpayers all that money by teleporting all around the stage."</p>

<h2>The Mysterious Story Mode</h2><p>In the <em>Invincible </em>series on Amazon's Prime Video service, Cecil is voiced by actor Walton Goggins. While J.K. Simmons has been confirmed to reprise his role as Omni-Man in the game, Quarter Up hesitates to confirm anyone else in the cast. However, voice acting plays a prominent role before, during, and after the fights, as characters exchange quips, but it will, in theory, play an even bigger role in the story mode, about which, to this point, Quarter Up has not revealed many details.</p><p>Though we've known the game will have a story mode for quite some time, details have been extraordinarily scarce, with the team declining to discuss much about it during my initial interaction with them. That's why, when I spoke with the developers again last week, I used it as an opportunity to ask them for everything they could tell me.</p><p>"The idea is that it's a standalone narrative set in the Invincible universe," Rogers says. "We wanted story mode to feel like an episode of the show that you would play; that was our approach with it. I was lucky enough to work with Helen Leigh, who's one of the writers from the show, and a close collaboration with [co-creator] Robert Kirkman. [...] We wanted to create this sort of specialized, specific, standalone piece of story that also feels like it fits and is right at home in the universe."</p>



<article data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="59911227-7b00-457b-a4f1-2ecedfadab6c" data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-embed-display-settings="{&quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;link_target&quot;:0,&quot;link_original&quot;:0,&quot;image_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_source&quot;:0,&quot;image_caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;embed_caption&quot;:0,&quot;content_warning&quot;:0}" data-langcode="en">

  
      

  
  
  
</article>

<p>Rogers also hints that there's a very specific reason tied to the story regarding why Cecil is playable. "I felt like it was a good time to bring up story mode again because being able to bring him out of the 'Guy in the Ear' and put him actually on the fight line, it gave us a lot more to play with in the story," he says. "I don't want to spoil too much because we love our surprises in the Invincible IP, but there's a reason why he's playable. In fact, every playable character that we've revealed thus far has a role of some sort in the story."</p><p>Though Quarter Up stops short of confirming what era of the <em>Invincible </em>show this playable "episode" known as Invincible VS takes place quite yet, the team did write with a specific era in mind, which is perhaps best reflected in the character Invincible, Mark Grayson. "I think that definitely informs how we write a character and what sort of aspects we bring, especially to Mark, a character that's evolving constantly across the IP," Rogers says. "We wanted to make sure that Mark felt like the right Mark, and in the right time and space. You can see from the gameplay we've released for him, he's got some of that whimsy that you see in a younger Mark space, but he's also got a little more of that seriousness that you sometimes see in Mark as he's growing as a superhero and learning."&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A New Hero (or Villain) Emerges</h2><p>Before I leave the call, Willette goads Rogers to "tell him about the super secret thing." That super secret thing is that Quarter Up worked in close collaboration with Skybound Entertainment to create a completely new character for Invincible VS. "We're going to have a brand-new character who has not appeared anywhere in the Invincible VS universe, in story and in the game," Rogers says with a smile. "Honestly, it was so exciting to be able to bring someone brand new and bring them into this, into the story, and into the universe. I'm bursting to tell you more, but I will be in so much trouble."</p><p>Though Rogers couldn't talk much more about the original character that will appear in Invincible VS, he does share that the team worked closely with the team behind the other parts of the IP to ensure it feels like an authentic inclusion. However, art director Dan Eder was able to speak a bit more about the surprise inclusion of this character and the team's overall approach to authenticity.</p><p>"Across the board, the creators are heavily involved in this project, and I think that's one of the privileges of being first-party [to Skybound]," Eder says. "We're a part of Skybound, so we have the right access to them, and they are super hyped about the game; they were involved from day one. A lot of the major decisions, we brainstorm with them, with the new character, with some of our existing characters, or certain story elements, and so we want to get their first impression and first reactions, and then we go from there. Who knows these characters better than the people who created them? We want to make sure that it's an authentic experience, but also that we're able to have our own special footprint when it comes to the game and how we show another side of the characters that you wouldn't have been able to see in other media."</p><p>Invincible VS arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.

              <p>In most extraction shooters, as well as a number of online survival games, players are all-too-familiar with the necessary evil known as a global wipe, in which everyone’s inventory and stats get reset to start all players off again on the same footing. It can sting a bit, but it helps balance out the game for newcomers, as folks who’ve been playing for years could otherwise build up a virtually limitless stockpile of goodies to maintain supremacy. Upcoming PvPvE extraction shooter <i>Arc Raiders</i>, however, has some different ideas on how to implement this in a way that won’t cost everyone their precious, hard-won loot.</p> <p>In particular, the developers are trying to solve one of the biggest problems with mandatory wipes: It’s really unfair to those who only have limited windows of opportunity to play the game. It sucks when you log a few hours in one week, get tied up with life stuff for the remainder of a month, then come back to find out even the meager earnings you scored during that first week are now gone due to the wipe. <i>Arc Raiders </i>developer Embark is aiming to solve that.</p>

 <p>In a blog post titled “<a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">Expedition Project</a>,” <i>Arc Raiders’</i> design director Virgil said that the studio “absolutely [sees] the benefits a global wipe provides [but] one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall.”</p>

 <p>Enter “Projects,” a feature that unlocks after level 20 with a scheduled eight-week window to complete, after which you’ll unlock the ability to reset your character. Should you fail to finish your project within the eight-week window, you can hold on to all of the progress you made, including your gear. You can then continue your progress during the next eight-week period that opens up.</p>

Hopefully <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Projects will solve that dilemma.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Up until now, every character confirmed to appear in Invincible Vs--the 3v3 tag fighter starring characters from Skybound's Invincible series--has been a souped-up superhero. Today, at New York Comic Con, Skybound and developer Quarter Up changed that, as Global Defense Agency head Cecil Stedman has officially been added to the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Designing a human character to fight against superhuman opponents on the level of Omni-Man and Invincible requires a change of approach. GameSpot sat down with Robert Kirkman, creator of Invincible, and multiple members of the dev team at Quarter Up to speak about the process of bringing Cecil and his unique abilities to the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS. - Cecil Stedman Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">"Only" human</h2><p dir="ltr">As a "normal" human among superheroes, Cecil relies less on superior strength and speed, and more on the vast resources of his government agency to provide extra firepower. This idea was key to Cecil's appearance in Invincible Vs, as it's those resources that make him a very formidable foe.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm not saying he has endless funds, but he's using a lot of taxpayer money to get around," executive producer Mike Willette said. "He can jump around and teleport because, while he's just a regular guy and doesn't have the mobility of double jumps and flight like other characters, with government funds, he can get around just fine."</p><p dir="ltr">That movement allows Cecil to manipulate the arena to his advantage, which Willette says plays into the character's role as a master manipulator. "He has projectiles with ranged arcs, he has a sonic mine that will hover before it detonates, he has a lot of ranged utility," Willette said. "He can fill the screen, almost like a bullet hell, and as soon as he confirms a hit, he flows right back into our combo system."</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just the moveset that proves challenging when adding a human like Cecil to a roster of superhumans; he has to <em>look</em> like he can hold his own against the rest of the roster. Skybound art director Dan Eder explained how the team found different ways to truly bring out Cecil's power.</p><p dir="ltr">"We asked ourselves, how do we still make him someone imposing without all the muscle mass of a huge bulky dude like Omni-Man?" Eder said. "We do lean more towards the show, but we go through so many iterations with every new character that I think the artistic process here is very challenging but also extremely satisfying. Ultimately, I think it feels very authentic to the character, and he's going to feel cohesive within the rest of the roster, even though they are visually pretty different."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582740"></a><figcaption>Cecil Stedman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582740-screenshot1.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4582741,1300-4582742,1300-4582743,1300-4582744,1300-4582746,1300-4582747,1300-4582748,1300-4582749" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582741-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582742-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582743-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582744-screenshot5.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582746-screenshot6.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582747-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582748-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4582749-screenshot9.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Fitting into the canon</h2><p dir="ltr">The addition of Cecil also came with the news of an original story arc that will be told within Invincible VS. Though the team didn't give specifics on where exactly the game fits into the overall timeline, Robert Kirkman said that the teams at Skybound and Quarter Up closely collaborated to make sure this story felt natural to the series as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Narrative director] Mike [Rogers] has been working really closely with Helen Leigh, who's one of the key writers on the Invincible series, and co-wrote the Atom Eve game with me," Kirkman confirmed. "There's logic to where the story mode for this game would fit in the narrative of the Invincible show, and while we're not talking specifics here today, fans of The Invincible television show are going to get a very cool experience that's tailored to fit within that narrative."</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers himself likens the Invincible Vs story as a "standalone special" to the overarching Invincible storyline. "It's been a real treat going to work with Helen and Robert," Rogers said, "and really make this feel authentic to the Invincible universe."</p><p dir="ltr">Where Atom Eve was a narrative adventure game focused on Atom Eve, the Invincible Vs story gave the narrative team a lot more to play with in terms of available characters. For Kirkman, the ability to use these characters in new ways is a big part of what makes a project like this so enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it's cool because it's a bigger playground for them to play in," Kirkman said. "The interaction of these characters is, at times, somewhat unique to the universe. There are characters in this game's story, who interact with one another, that haven't really interacted very much before in other forms of Invincible."</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs is set to launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Cecil joins a cast of playable characters that also includes Omni-Man, Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode, Bulletproof, Thula, and Battle Beast.</p>

                <p>A 17-year veteran on the Halo development team has left the company, posting an ominous-sounding message on the way out.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7379767940897959936/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glenn Israel said on LinkedIn</a> that he is "no longer contributing to the Halo universe" after working on the sci-fi series since 2008. Israel got his start on the Halo franchise at Bungie before joining 343 Industries--now known as Halo Studios--as art director.</p><p>Israel said in his post that there is "little more I can say for the moment" about the nature of his exit from the Halo development team. He added, "I intend to share this particular story in its entirety when it is absolutely safe to do so next year."</p><p>He also shared a message for others in the games industry, a business that's facing "dire" times of late. "No illusion of security nor promise of wealth or fame or power is worth trading away your health, your dignity, your ethics, or values--and no one can force you to," he said. "Stay strong, take evidence when necessary, and find where you belong."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on this situation and Israel's exit from Halo Studios.

Microsoft has made major changes to the franchise and its studios since then, including installing a new executive leadership team and switching game engines for future projects, while acknowledging that Halo Infinite missed the mark in some respects.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-secret-behind-the-fastest-xp-jp-grind-in-final-fantasy-tactics-frogs.1321276/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> lets you train a group of newb Squires into an ultra-efficient death squad of hybrid specialists. There are so <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679">many neat Jobs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-best-abilities-guide-ivalice-chronicles-2000631130">abilities to unlock</a> in this strategy RPG that, in no time at all, you’ll be wondering what the fastest way is to obtain all of them. While there are many time-honored traditions when it comes to min-maxing the grind in Square Enix’s classic, some are more effective than others. And frogs are one of the best (technically they’re toads, but frogs is funnier to say and write).</p> <p>Every action you take in combat that accomplishes something nets your character XP (experience points) and JP (job points). The first raises your regular level and the second raises your Job level and are spent to unlock abilities. You get more XP for performing actions on characters that are a higher level, and more JP the higher your overall Job level is, with bonuses for having the Double JP abilities equipped (<a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">more on that here</a>).</p>

 <p>There are roughly three tiers of grinding in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The first is going to a place like the Mandalia Plains, killing everything but the enemy Chocobo, and then cornering it so that it keeps healing itself as your characters keep attacking it. The second is unlocking Focus from the Squire Job on every character, keeping one enemy alive in a battle, and then just spending the rest of the time having everyone keep using this ability over and over again. It’s boring and tedious, but it gets results and is easy to implement. The third is having everyone learn a dance or Bard song have them perform it on repeat. It’s similar to the Focus version but requires fewer button presses and neutralizes enemies without killing them.</p>

   <p>None of these, however, is as elegant and foolproof as the “Berserker Frog” method.&nbsp; In this version you bring someone along who can cast both the Black Mage’s Toad spell and the Mystic’s Fervor (Berserk) and Induration (Petrify) spells. You then have them turn a single remaining enemy and the rest of your party into frogs so they deal as little damage as possible. They then cast Fervor to give all of the frogs Berserk so they just keep attacking the nearest enemy. They then cast Induration on themselves to turn themselves into stone so you don’t have to keep controlling them. Your party will proceed to auto-grind for a good long while.</p>

 <p>Why not just use the actual auto-battle AI controls in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>? Well, they aren’t always reliable in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster. Set characters with Focus to run away from battle and they just won’t use any abilities. Set someone to just heal allies and they’ll eventually still go and start killing stuff. AI control is fine for breezing through an encounter while you go make a sandwich but it won’t be nearly as effective over the same period of time as the Frog method. If you want to go above and beyond, you can keep multiple enemies alive and bring someone with the Arts of War ability to reduce the enemy’s power and speed before turning them into a frog so there’s no chance of anyone dying.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1o0tcgm/comment/nieywz6/">Some fans</a> still maintain that the Focus method is simpler and faster. You send everyone to a corner of the map, set their AI to run away, and then hope they use Focus a bunch of times before killing the one enemy that’s left. But I find with the streamlined AI in the remaster, that’s just not as reliable anymore. Frogs are the way.</p>

              <p>Talented creators say the darndest things. The latest one to put his foot in his mouth is George Miller, director of the very good, fantastic, wonderful girl-power post-apocalyptic action film <i>Mad Max: Fury Road</i>, as well as many other great movies. In an interview the filmmaker gave shortly before he’s expected to lead a panel of judges at an upcoming Australian AI film festival (they generated a festival?), homeboy opened his mouth to proudly declare that “AI is here to stay.”</p> <p>In his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/09/ai-film-making-omni-festival-mad-max-director-george-miller-interview">interview with <i>The Guardian</i></a> (h/t <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/movies/mad-max-fury-road-director-george-miller-disappoints-everyone-by-taking-part-in-an-ai-film-festival-ai-is-here-to-stay/">real person Megan Garside at <i>GamesRadar</i></a>), the famed filmmaker said: “AI is arguably the most dynamically evolving tool in making moving image. As a filmmaker, I’ve always been <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">driven by the tools</a>.” If he has any concerns over labor, plagiarism, and Shinra-esque data centers sucking the planet dry, they seem to be, at best, secondary.</p>

 <p>But okay, let’s hold off on the pitchforks and torches for a second and hear the writer and producer of <i>Babe</i> out:</p> <blockquote><p>It’s the balance between human creativity and machine capability, that’s what the debate and the anxiety is about […] It strikes me how this debate echoes earlier moments in art history.</p></blockquote> <p>Miller went on to loosely deliver some pseudo-historical background, comparing AI’s rise to that of oil painting in the Renaissance and photography in the mid-19th century. “It will make screen storytelling available to anyone who has a calling to it,” Miller said, echoing the common pro-AI argument that it’s some kind of democratizing force. “[Kids not yet in their teens are] making films–or at least putting footage together. It’s way more egalitarian.”</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089">Open AI Is Already Backtracking After Flood Of Video Game Slop Including Sam Altman Eating Pikachu</a></p> <p>There is a degree of truth to some of these statements, but it’s about time we’ve started to have a more honest conversation about the history of human technological development and the intentions of those who own these means of production. These same tools that, yes, may make it easier to mush together some ideas to produce a concept of a movie or piece of art, are not only doing so at extreme cost to the planet (<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-data-centers-electricity-bills">and people’s energy bills</a>). They’re also making it harder for aspiring creatives to make a living doing this work, as those deploying AI are largely doing so to replace functioning, compensated labor in creative endeavors (and other forms of work). Throwing a sentence at a machine to have it spit out a neat-looking idea might lower the barrier to entry, but I’m not sure how denying people the ability to make a living with their art by replacing their ability to make money by producing that art is more egalitarian.</p>

 <p>And as to kids “not yet in their teens” making films? Steven Spielberg made his first “movie” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg#Early_life_and_background">when he was but a pre-teen himself</a>, a boy scout earning a badge for an 8mm film, and that was after a youth spent filming model trains to recreate a scene from <i>The Greatest Show on Earth</i>. And he certainly wasn’t <a href="https://youtu.be/gaRN0jwoyiM?si=gSnWV7QNsOy8m51i">the only filmmaker doing such things</a> at a young age.</p> <p>So remind me again what AI is going to offer aspiring filmmakers that history has shown will already act on their passions? And if AI eats away at job opportunities for young filmmakers in a world where everyone’s just typing prompts into slop machines, how is this more egalitarian?</p>

Set in the ancient past, during the founding of Hyrule, this hack-and-slash action game will pit the Princess and her allies against massive armies in their war against the Demon King Ganondorf. After several trailers, multiple runs of their hands-on demo at Tokyo Game Show, and <em>probably</em> too much time going over footage frame-by-frame, I’ve come away with seven key changes from Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity that you should know before starting in Age of Imprisonment. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1) This is a True Prequel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity had a fun story: reliving the war between The Champions and Calamity Ganon. Set 100 years before The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it was an opportunity to spend extended time with fan favorite characters like Urbosa and Daruk, and take control of the Divine Beasts in the war. The only problem? It split off into a separate side story, making it non-canon to BoTW. That’s just fine for folks who love a good filler episode, but for those of us invested in the complex and often contradictory overarching Zelda story, that was a bit of a bummer. Fortunately for us lore Hounds, Age of Imprisonment is confirmed to be canon to the Tears of the Kingdom story. That means our adventure with Zelda, Rauru, Queen Sonia will tell us exactly how this ancient war with Ganondorf played out. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment - September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">2) Combat is Evolving</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The hack-and-slash combat at the center of Hyrule Warriors is alive and well, and it’s evolving further thanks to all new Unique Skills. These special moves are tailored towards specific situations and let you execute an aerial attack, targeted toward leaping of flying enemies, and a straightforward thrust attack to use against charging enemies. As the name implies, these are unique to each character. Zelda, for example, can unleash a barrage of Light Arrows from her Bow of Light to bring down flyers, or use Piercing Light on charging enemies, blasting them with a beam of light fired from the tip of her sword. These are strong options that will reward making the correct decisions quickly in the heat of battle, and if used correctly will do immediate damage to the Weak-Point gauges of tougher enemies, setting you up for devastating Weak Point attacks. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army.&nbsp;</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">3) Sync Strikes are your Ace in the Hole</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda won’t be fighting alone, and the way her allies factor into battles is evolving thanks to the new team-up attacks. This goes beyond the simple souped-up special attacks from musou games of old, as now the pairs of warriors employ unique tactics when paired together – to devastating effects. Two examples I saw in my hands-on demo were Zelda paired with Raru firing a powerful, aimable beam of pure light that tears through enemies, and Zelda with Mineru summoning Mineru’s hulking construct to use as an enemy-smashing battlemech. Whether it’s every pairing on just select compatible duos, it’s clear Zelda and company will have a massive array of moves to fight back against Ganondorf and his army. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">4) New Hardware Means New Tricks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Age of Imprisonment is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2, which means it takes full advantage of the more powerful hardware. While I haven’t done a full stress test just yet to see how far I can push the action before the framerate breaks down, I was impressed in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-evolved-into-an-even-better-legend-of-zelda-complement"><u>hands-on demo</u></a> with how well it looked and ran. Also, fighting thousands of bokoblins is more fun with a friend, and Age of Imprisonment makes that easier thanks to GameShare. The idea is pretty simple: if one player has a Switch 2 and a copy of Age of Imprisonment, then another player can be their co-op body by joining the session from their own Switch or Switch 2. Just keep in mind that the session belongs to the player doing the sharing, so once they stop playing the session ends for both players. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5) Zonai Devices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So much of what made Tears of the Kingdom special was the way you could find and use Zonai devices – ancient machine parts – to aid your adventure. You can do that here too, as demonstrated when I tried out a Flame Emitter. This let me fry my enemies with an aimable stream of fire when I held it. It could also be activated and dropped on the ground to burn everything around it. I’ve thrown time bombs into the mouth of a Frox, and watched in trailers as Zelda combined the wind from a sideways fan with a Shock Emitter to create a massive electric cyclone. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">6) The World Above and Below</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Our entire demo took place in the Depths, in the area just beyond Mineru’s Lab. I didn’t get to see a map, but I do know that Age of Calamity covered the entire overworld, and the Depths spans an area just as large. That potentially doubles where levels could take place, and that’s before factoring in the Sky Islands, places we know from prior trailers where we will be fighting. Taken together, there is a lot of potential variety for where levels will take place, and it’s fair to wonder just how big Zelda’s fight in the ancient past will be. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7) Zelda and Link</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda, despite her title role in the series, has almost always been relegated to, at best, a secondary character, and at worst an off-screen motivation for Link on his adventures. While she was the star of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, her largely non-combat role in a retro-style adventure stands in stark contrast to her place in Age of Imprisonment, wielding a sword as the lead character as the vanguard in battle. Link, meanwhile, is in the “present” many centuries after the Imprisoning War takes place. While we have seen a construct with a strikingly Link-like visage show up in trailers and character art, we know this will be rare, and for Hyrule Warriors first, a case of Zelda taking the lead while Link steps out of the spotlight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even these seven items barely scratch the surface when it comes to what’s new in The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment, like a Korok warrior joining the fray, or an all new cast of Champions to defend Hyrule alongside Zelda. Fortunately you won’t need to wait much longer to uncover all the secrets from the great war near the founding of Hyrule. The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment launches on November 6, exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-7-key-changes-from-the-first-game]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s currently no word on casting, but the first film starred Jack Black (as the series' protagonist Steve), Jason Momoa, Emma Meyers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-has-sold-over-1-6-million-units-to-date-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima.1321252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-has-strong-debut-in-the-united-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debut week's physical sales data from the United Kingdom</a>, we now have more estimates suggesting that Ghost of Yōtei was very successful for developer Sucker Punch Productions and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has shared</a> that the game has already surpassed 1.6 million units sold to customers to date (over two million units if we consider copies already sold to retailers). This is just slightly slower than its predecessor, Ghost of Tsushima, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 2.4 million units in the first three days and became the fastest-selling Sony-published new intellectual property released for the PlayStation 4</a>.</p>



<p>As previously noted, though, Ghost of Tsushima launched on July 17, 2020, when most of the world still had stay-at-home restrictions that effectively turned into a considerable incentive to play games. During that time, the gaming industry reached new revenue heights due to the abnormally high amount of time people were able to dedicate to games.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the game debuted at the very end of the PS4's lifecycle, when the console had sold 110 million units globally, whereas the PS5 has just reached 80 million units sold as of this August. In this perspective, Ghost of Yōtei is performing admirably, even more so when you consider other factors, such as the fact that the budget was reportedly the same as the previous installment (around $60 million) and that it is currently outperforming all major PS5 releases, including Assassin's Creed Shadows, since Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, over 93% of those who played Ghost of Tsushima returned for the new game. They certainly didn't go wrong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as I explained in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>



<p>The latest Alinea Analytics newsletter also reveals that Battlefield 6 is poised to launch to great numbers tomorrow, with 1.8 million pre-orders on Steam alone and 3.5 million wishlists on Valve's platform. While you wait to play the game yourself, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go read Wccftech's review written by David Carcasole</a>.</p>

<p>A sequel to A Minecraft Movie is officially in the works, complete with a June 2027 release.</p>



<p>The worldwide sensation Minecraft has kept players occupied with its world-building fun since 2011. Millions of fans have purchased the game, and it has become a household name since. This year, Warner Bros. released a movie adaptation of the game, called A Minecraft Movie. Needless to say, it is currently the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a>. Now, after months of speculation, it seems we’ll be returning to the mines real soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-sequel-releasing-on-june-27th-2027-director-returning">A Minecraft Movie Sequel Releasing on June 27th, 2027, Director Returning</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AMinecraftMovie/status/1976341544266498142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> post, it was announced that A Minecraft Movie sequel is officially in the works. It’s unknown what the sequel will be named. Furthermore, the original director, Jared Hess, will return to do the second one. With a poster showing two shiny pickaxes, we also have a release date: June 27th, 2027. The date does place it with to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-simpsons-movie-coming-after-almost-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Movie 2</a>, so it’s sure to be a big day for the box office.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it’s unknown if any of the original cast will return for the sequel. Even more so, we don’t know about the plot, as it’s being kept under wraps for now. Despite that, the movie is sure to be just as popular, especially since it knows what worked. Countless memes like “Chicken Jockey” and “I am Steve” flooded the internet even before its release and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even caused uproars</a> in theaters. Warner Bros. is aware of it and honed in on it for marketing, which likely caused its box-office soar. It’ll be interesting to see how it fares out and if it’ll keep the charm many fans enjoyed.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/10/rubiks-cube-reimagined-as-a-multi-game-multi-screened-gadget-for-299/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rubik%E2%80%99s-cube-gets-a-299-update-complete-with-ips-screens-and-its-own-apps.1321243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The Rubik’s Cube has been reinvented with more games and many more screens for much more money.</p>
<p>What has long been cherished as a simple toy yet complex puzzle requiring nothing but a healthy amount of twisting, turning, and patience has been rebooted for the 21st century. Naturally, that calls for a few dashes of technology.</p>
<p>Differing from the original Rubik’s Cube, which has six faces that each contain a 3×3 grid, the Rubik’s WOWCube, made available for preorder today, as spotted by<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/797601/spin-master-rubiks-cube-wowcube-puzzle-app-store-mobile-games"> The Verge</a>, has six faces with 2×2 grids.</p>


<p>Rather than a solid-colored sticker, each of the toy's 24 squares is a 240×240 IPS display. The cube itself is composed of eight "cubicle modules," as Cubios, the company behind the toy, calls them. Each module includes three of those IPS screens and a dedicated SoC. As a Cubios <a href="https://wowcube.com/support/">support page</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our patented magnetic connectors allow the modules to maintain perfect electrical contact and seamless data flow between them, no matter how the cube is rotated. This ensures that data can be transferred between autonomous modules on the fly, enabling data sharing and distributing low voltage power across the WOWCube …</p></blockquote>
<p>Each of the 24 displays can be set to show a solid color for solving a simpler, but still captivating, Rubik’s puzzle. Alternatively, the screens can be twisted and turned to play dozens of different games, including <em>Block Buster</em>,<em> Space Invaders</em>, and <em>Jewel Hunter.</em></p>

The game comes packed with a full campaign, collectibles to hunt down, and plenty of achievements to earn. Below, we'll break down the mission list and all of the side objectives you might want to tackle during your playthrough of Battlefield 6's story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Battlefield 6 - Campaign length and missions</h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 has a total of nine campaign missions. On average, it should take you around 4-5 hours to complete the campaign on the normal difficulty level. Of course, you can take your time to explore the map, hunt down collectibles, and attempt the game's specific achievement/trophy requirements. A harder difficulty could lead to slower mission progression, naturally.</p>
