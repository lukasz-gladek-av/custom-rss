            <p>We don't write much about board and paper games around these parts, not since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/cardboard-children">Cardboard Children</a> was sent to the dissolving pits. I still feel that roleplay and strategy gaming has a home here on RPS even when it's not digital though, and doubly so when it's the work of our former comrades.
</p>
<p>Enter Gold Teeth, a tabletop RPG "of piracy &amp; occult horror" which just cleared <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/gold-teeth-the-tabletop-rpg-of-piracy-and-occult-horror">its Kickstarter funding goal</a>, and which is designed by Marsh Davies and Jim Rossignol (RPS in peace).
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Marsh produced excellent work for RPS during our post-pre-history adolescence, slinging alt text as chief of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/marsh-davies">Premature Evaluation</a> (also covered in lye in the RPS column latrine). He also led some of our earliest sorties into video territory with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MUwVsTVHIY&amp;list=PL8bDjLl3h2veC8dJ0Fv5mkOCsBbrxHsyD">Fail Forward</a>.
</p>
<p>Jim Rossignol, I don't really remember, but I think he wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/authors/jim-rossignol">a post or two</a>?
</p>
<p>Gold Teeth, then. It's a 3-6 player tabletop roleplaying game in which players form a crew of gnarly sailors in 1781 and traverse land and sea in search of "some measure of salvation in a place doomed by colonial terror and supernatural catastrophe." It's adapted from Forged In The Dark's ruleset, is a standalone successor to the Marsh and Jim's own landlubbing original Teeth, and comes as a 350+ page hardback and full-colour book.
</p>
<p>The Kickstarter pitches it as "Sea Of Thieves meets Uzumaki", among other appealing comparisons. It's due to ship sometime in late 2025, but if that seems too long to wait, or if you need a greater taste of what Gold Teeth might offer, the Kickstarter page also suggests you try the free digital versions of Teeth one-shots which are <a href="https://teethrpg.itch.io/">available via Itch</a>. I'd find anything called <a href="https://teethrpg.itch.io/night-of-the-hogmen">Night Of The Hogmen</a> irresistible. 
</p>
<p>Obviously the disclosure here could be as long as the actual post. I have hired Marsh and I was hired by Jim. I have played D&amp;D with both of them. Marsh and I have been drunk on my many podcasts together, leading to only occasional disaster. These facts only strengthen my belief in their talent, and in the wisdom of supporting any project which permits Marsh to write and draw fucked up shit at sea. I'm also pretty sure some of you RPS readers might like to know that two of our good eggs are hatching new schemes, so here's the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/gold-teeth-the-tabletop-rpg-of-piracy-and-occult-horror">link to that Kickstarter again</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

(which is owned by Amazon) is offering the best deal on <a href="https://zdcs.link/Ey5ky?object_uuid=deb3cf9d-a475-438f-9891-cab03137762a&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>. Right now you can get a 3 month code for only $36.49. Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">raised the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> to $19.99 per month, so now you're saving 40% off a 3 month membership. Note that you can purchase multiple codes and apply them to your account, up to a maximum of 36 months. If you're an Xbox gamer, this is a great way to save a lot of money in the long run since you won't have to buy new release games individually to play them.</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>There is a new coupon "<strong>ULTIMATE</strong>" that takes $3 off <u>one</u> order, dropping the 3 month code price down to $33.49. If you purchase multiple codes, this coupon will only work on one code. The rest of the 3 month codes will be $36.49 each.</p><h2>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for $33.49</h2><p><em><strong>Use code: ULTIMATE</strong></em></p><div id="148732" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Membership</h3></p><div><p>Multiple digital cards can be stacked</p></div></div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate gives you access to a library of hundreds of Xbox games, including day one releases. You can play them for the entirety of your membership without any restrictions. You do lose access to them once your membership is over, but if you ever decide to renew, all your past achievements and progress will be saved. You'll also have access to Xbox Game Pass for PC. Although there aren't nearly as many games as there are on Xbox, there are still plenty of AAA titles to keep you sated. Other perks include exclusive membership discounts, the ability to play your games across multiple devices with cloud gaming, free access to EA Play membership, as well as bonus in-game content and rewards. It is an exceptionally good - almost essential - membership for Xbox gamers. New release games are not cheap, and being able to play them without buying them will save you a lot of money and easily recoup the cost of the membership.</p><p><em>Looking for more deals?

Yet after reviews came out and people got the game in their hands, it turned out that <em>Lies of P</em> wasn’t just a discount <em>Bloodborne</em> (the 2015 masterpiece from FromSoftware), but rather it was actually…good. </p><p>That has a lot to do with the game’s iterations on ideas often considered core to the Soulslike genre. One example is in <em>Lies of P</em>’s guarding, which plays off of parrying in FromSoftware games. In <em>Lies of P</em>, guarding feels like an essential skill you must learn along your journey, but not one that’s absurdly difficult to master. It excels, though, in its innovation. That is best illustrated by the weapon crafting system. Sure, in a Souls game, you are likely to collect a number of weapons, some of which may even have multiple forms. But <em>Lies of P </em>takes that idea to the extreme. Every weapon in the game is made up of two parts: a handle and blade. The ability to mix and match your weapon components makes for a fascinating customizable gameplay loop with incredible depth.</p><p>But the greatest joy of <em>Lies of P</em> comes in its world, which is a shockingly impressive retelling of the Pinocchio story. The game transforms the familiar tale into a gothic horror story about identity and free will. Pinocchio is still a puppet, but in the world of <em>Lies of P</em>, this story investigates how the ability to choose our fate makes us human. Everything about the world, from its gritty takes on the Blue Fairy and Geppetto to its killer automatons, is extremely silly out of context. But <em>Lies of P</em> weaves a compelling narrative with all of these pieces. </p><p>It’s one of the reasons I can’t wait for the&nbsp;sequel which, as the game teases, will involve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-sequel-dlc-dorothy-oz-1850981029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-sequel-dlc-dorothy-oz-1850981029"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></a></span>.

The $999 Focus Vision is available for preorder from now until October 17th on HTC’s website.</p><p>The Focus Vision can be used either as a standalone device or tethered to your PC using USB-C. It’s essentially a beefed-up version of the Focus 3, which the company released in 2021 — it has the same 2448 x 2448 per-eye resolution and 120-degree field of view and also uses a Snapdragon XR2 chip. But it gains features like dual 16MP cameras with color passthrough, and it can now automatically adjust the lenses to compensate for the distance between your eyes. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->19</p><div><figcaption><em>The HTC Vive Focus Vision.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: HTC</cite></p></div></div><p>HTC is going for gamers with this headset. Part of that is the inclusion of foveated rendering, meaning it can focus its graphical resources only where you’re looking instead of across your whole field of view at once. “Now, PC gamers can bring the same high-end headsets used in VR arcades into their homes,” Shen Ye, HTC Vive’s global head of product, said in a press release.</p><p>The Focus Vision also adds DisplayPort support via USB-C, which HTC says enables a lossless connection when tethered to your PC. And after an update later this year, DisplayPort tethering will allow the displays’ refresh rate to go from the normal 90Hz to 120Hz. The Focus Vision has 128GB of storage (with a microSD slot for up to 2TB more), and 12GB of RAM, up from the 8GB of its predecessor. The headset also supports all Focus 3 accessories.</p><p>A built-in battery can keep the Focus Vision going for 20 minutes, giving you time to swap out the main power pack if you burn through its about two-hour battery life. Additionally, the headset has a new fan that will pull 30 percent more air through for better cooling, according to the company.</p><p>The head strap got some love, too. “Users can be pretty abusive,” said Dan O’Brien, HTC president of Americas. But that showed the company where there were “weak points” in the Focus 3’s design, and as a result of that, HTC “improved the metal hook for the back, topside handling, as well as the side arms.” </p><p>The Vive Focus Vision aims right at the consumer market that HTC’s Focus 3, with its Quest 2-style controllers, seemed to flirt with. (Previous Focus headsets were heavily business-oriented.) Other headsets from HTC have also targeted consumers, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23539328/htc-vive-xr-elite-ar-vr-headset-pricing-launch-date-ces">last year’s Vive XR Elite</a>, a lighter, $1,099 headset that also has color passthrough video but uses lower resolution screens than the Vision.</p><p>Anyone who preorders before October 17th will get a free kit that includes a 5-meter USB-C cable with DP 1.4 alternate mode support, as well as multiple adapters for PC VR streaming. The company also says it’s tossing in a “choice of three popular game bundles.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/freedom-wars-remastered-vita-ps5-switch-scifi-rpg-1851651681<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PlayStation Vita didn’t have many standout exclusives, but the sci-fi action RPG <em>Freedom Wars</em> was one of them. The game by Japanese studio Dimps, Inc. about criminals forced to fight giant robots in a post-apocalyptic future seemed destined to be stranded on Sony’s ill-fated handheld, but in a surprise twist it’s not only coming to modern platforms, it’s also getting an HD upgrade.</p><p>Bandai Namco announced the move overnight, confirming that <em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em> will come to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC (via Steam) on January 10, 2025. In addition to general graphical enhancements, the game will support 4K resolution and 60fps on PS5 and PC. There have also been some changes to the gameplay to improve balance, difficulty, weapon crafting, and upgrades. <br></p><p>The teaser trailer for the remaster conveys the general premise of <em>Freedom Wars,</em> which is that in the year 102014 the planet’s surface is largely destroyed and uninhabitable, forcing humanity to live in underground siloes that function as penal colony city-states. People are convicted as criminals at birth and forced to work off million-year life sentences by serving as mercenaries in intra-colony raids and skirmishes with giant robots called “abductors” that try to steal citizens. </p><p>The game plays similar to <em>God Eater</em> with missions consisting of big battles where players run around hacking away at smaller enemies and big bosses. Grinding missions and completing optional objectives net resources and XP that can be used to upgrade weapons and skills, unlocking tougher missions and new story beats. It’s grindy but fun, and the worldbuilding and anime style make it feel like a unique riff on violent dystopia storytelling. A mechanic called “thorns” lets characters use a giant red whip to set traps and decapitate enemy body parts. <br></p><p>“I’ve wanted to make a sequel since it was released 10 years ago, but the opportunity never came,” the director of the original game, Takashi Tsukamoto, said in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/09/18/20240918-freedomwars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview at the PlayStation Blog</a></span>. “This time, we were blessed with the opportunity to develop it and have Bandai Namco Entertainment produce it, and since it was also the turning point of the 10th anniversary, we decided to do it at this timing.” </p><p>Tetsunosuke Seki, director of the remaster, said the loot system will be much less luck-based this time around, hopefully leading to fewer pain points in the progression system. More buttons on the PS5 DualSense should also make the control scheme much less cumbersome. The only thing that would be better is if Sony secretly released a PS Vita 2 for long-time fans to play it on. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is still planned for a release date of Fall 2025. That’s what <a href="https://materials.proxyvote.com/Approved/874054/20240723/AR_582262.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Two Interactive reaffirmed</a> in its 2024 annual report released on Wednesday. </p>



<p>The statement came in a section of the report specifically highlighting Rockstar Games. </p>







<p>“Rockstar Games continues to invest in the franchise and plans to release Grand Theft Auto VI in the Fall of calendar 2025,” the company says while stating that more details will be released over time. Take Two then repeats the same message later in its “Content Release Highlights” section.</p>



<p>There had been a lot of rumors — dating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-gta-6-delay-isnt-what-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back as early as March 2024</a> — suggesting that GTA 6 was going to be pushed to 2026. While a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay is always possible</a>, the status of the game remains now what it was earlier this year. Everything currently sits on schedule with a planned release for next year.</p>



<p>The first trailer for GTA 6 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-releases-gta-6-trailer/">released last December</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">record-breaking viewership</a>. Since then, however, no more information has been provided as the one-year anniversary of the trailer’s release approaches. If the game is going to come a year from now, it could be assumed that Rockstar is gearing up to start the marketing campaign for one of the most anticipated video games of all time.</p>



<p>Are you confident that GTA 6 sticks with its Fall 2025 release date? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

            <p>
Nintendo fans are frothing over freshly-posted images purporting to show the under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>. The pictures include apparent 3D models of the console and its Joy-Con, as well as photos of the console's shell - including its circuit board.
</p>
<p>
In general, the images depict a console almost identical to the current Switch, albeit with a larger screen size and what look to be magnets on the sides of its Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
These details match with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/treat-yourself-with-eight-inches-of-lcd-on-switch-2-report-says">previous</a> publicly-reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-report-details-magnetic-joy-con">details of Switch 2</a>, but do little to verify the images themselves. Indeed, doubt has been poured over the pictures - originally <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/66ea3de80000000027006ccb">posted</a> to a Chinese social media site then shared more widely via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fjp352/photos_of_switch_2_factory_prototypes_have_leaked/">reddit</a> - since it was discovered the original poster was a 3D design and model enthusiast. 
</p>
<p>
The original post author has since deleted the images from their social media profile - which also includes detailed models of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth Wukong</a> figurines and other creations, crafted by someone clearly capable of copying and recreating 3D designs.
</p>
<p>
Still, the two photographic images posted alongside the 3D models do warrant some closer inspection - and in particular, the photo that appears to show the Switch 2's PCB (printed circuit board).
</p>
<p>
The detail shown on this board is remarkable, and the PCB number printed on it lines up with leaked shipment data for parts used in Switch 2 prototypes last year. Could the photos show a real prototype from which the poster of these images was recreating their own 3D models? Perhaps, though even then this would come with the caveat that the model that has since been superseded, and shouldn't be expected to translate exactly to the final article. In other words, even if this is real, it's out of date.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is the most interesting/plausible Switch 2 leak image - looks like some rough prototype components. Why fake a mainboard? Pay attention to the small size of the battery chamber and keep expectations firmly in check on handheld performance. <a href="https://t.co/M3DKSFnt3C">pic.twitter.com/M3DKSFnt3C</a></p>— Digital Foundry (@digitalfoundry) <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfoundry/status/1836416430276784588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

Nintendo is yet to announce any details of its next console, other than to confirm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">it will announce Switch 2 properly before April 2025</a>, the end of its current financial year. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for comment on the images posted today. 
</p>
<p>
Previous reporting by Eurogamer has tracked Switch 2 on its path to release, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-demoed-switch-2-to-developers-at-gamescom">briefings to developers in the summer of 2023</a>, to early word in February 2024 that the console was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">now set for a 2025 release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The past few weeks have seen Switch 2 rumours and speculation reach fever pitch, as anticipation of an announcement from Nintendo spikes. Any reveal from Nintendo will need to fit around an already-busy calendar for the company, with the impending launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and other Switch games, as its current-gen console is supported for one final Christmas.

			<p>Less than a day following the PC launch of Final Fantasy XVI, modders have already come up with a so-called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FFXVI Fix mod</a> that improves some key shortcomings, such as:</p>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disable the 30FPS cap in cutscenes/photo mode.</li>
<li>Adjust gameplay FOV.</li>
<li>Allow frame generation in cutscenes.</li>
<li>JXL screenshot quality option and fixes hitching while taking screenshots.</li>
<li>Allow the use of motion blur + frame generation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ultrawide/narrower</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove pillarboxing/letterboxing in borderless/fullscreen.</li>
<li>Fixed HUD scaling with configurable HUD size.</li>
<li>Fixed FOV scaling at &lt;16:9.</li>
</ul>
<p>To install the FFXVI Fix mod, download the file from Nexus (or <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/FFXVIFix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>) and extract the zipped file's contents to the main game folder. To adjust settings, tweak the FFXVIIFix.ini file. The mod also works on Linux/Steam Deck. In this case, open up the game properties in Steam and add "WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%" to the launch options.</p>
<p>This isn't the only mod available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus</a> for Final Fantasy XVI. Other useful options include a mod to toggle UI and/or HUD on and off (with two presets of visibility), a mod that increases the item limit on all standard items to 9 (higher values prevent the game from booting, apparently), and a couple of ReShade presets that changes the colors.</p>
<p>Many more mods will undoubtedly follow, and Producer Naoki Yoshida is <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-asks-pc-users-to-not-go-too-far-with-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crossing</a> his fingers that they won't be offensive or inappropriate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Help Small Creators Grow With YouTube’s New ‘Hype’ Feature]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-hype-new-creator-feature/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/help-small-creators-grow-with-youtube%E2%80%99s-new-%E2%80%98hype%E2%80%99-feature.984681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-hype-new-creator-feature/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>YouTube has unveiled ‘Hype’, an all-new mechanic designed to promote small streamers and creators and allow their communities to boost them up and better their discoverability. Per a recent release, Hype will ‘give fans a stake in the success of their favourite emerging creators’.</p>



<p>From the ground up, Hype has been created to help streamers with under 500,000 subscribers get ‘seen’ on YouTube.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-does-hype-work">How Does Hype Work?</h2>



<p>YouTube’s ‘Hype’ feature is pretty simple.</p>



<p>If you’re following a small creator (&lt;500,000 subscribers) and they publish a new video, you’ll be able to ‘hype’ that video and push them up a virtual leaderboard. The more hype a video receives, the further up the leaderboard it’ll rank, and if a streamer or content creator ranks high enough, they’ll secure special badges on their videos.</p>



<p>Users will have three ‘hypes’ to use per week, so you’ll have to vote sparingly on which videos you want to boost.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-hype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a> discussing Hype, YouTube wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Hype, we hope to make the viewing experience more active and engaging, driven by shared purpose and enthusiasm. That not only makes hyping more engaging for viewers but also gives creators a powerful new way to connect with their audiences and grow their channels.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a neat new feature if it couldn’t be monetised. To that end, YouTube will allow viewers to ‘purchase additional hypes’ — but the team stressed that this will unlock another revenue stream for creators and not necessarily the platform, so that could be a huge win.</p>



<p>It was revealed that in test countries, users hyped up 50,000 channels with more than five million unique hype votes. </p>



<p>The team hasn’t confirmed when the feature will roll out globally, but we can expect Hype to land in new markets soon enough.</p>



<p>Do you think this is a solid feature for boosting small streamers, or will it likely end up being abused? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon, reportedly will cost $40 and the game is too far along in development to pivot to a free-to-play model.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-marathon-details-on-heroes-price-and-radio-silence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> and <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-marathon-targeting-40-launch-price/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, Helldivers 2's $40 price point and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">monumental success</a> cemented the premium-cost idea for Marathon.

Barring any sort of catastrophe, Marathon won't be launching with a free-to-play model. The game will also reportedly have a standard cosmetic and battle-pass system in addition to the upfront $40 cost.</p>

<p>There will also reportedly be no substantial updates about Marathon until Spring 2025, although game director Joe Ziegler might reveal some information to clear up leaks and rumors, such as a potential class or hero system.

            <p>
Amid ongoing player complaints and claims Ubisoft's free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a> is underperforming, the publisher has insisted the game is "absolutely not dying" as it unveils plans to tackle a range of issues in an updated development roadmap.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft shared XDefiant's latest roadmap in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG">newly published blog post</a>, starting with an update on the game's netcode and hitreg issues, and admitting it "still [has] a ways to go" as far as improvements are concerned. "I just want to quickly address the status of the game. i.e. is the game dying?," the author then wrote. "No, the game is absolutely not dying. We know there are things we need to improve like Netcode/Hitreg and adding more content to progression, but the game is doing well. We just want it to do better. And we do that by addressing the concerns of our community which has always been the plan."
</p>
<p>
The post continued, "Ubisoft is very much behind us and has allocated more resources to the team in order for us to do that." To that end, the accompanying roadmap promises "a lot of new content and features" for XDefiant's first year, ending in its "biggest ever event".

<p>
According to Ubisoft's roadmap, Seasons 2, 3, and 4 will all feature a new faction, three new weapons, three new maps, and new limited time modes, with more specific inclusions - such as the arrival of Bots mode, Bomb! mode, and private matches - also mentioned. Additionally, there's talk of numerous planned improvements, including battle pass progression speed changes, plus mantle, player collision, footstep audio improvements - which come alongside ongoing work on netcode and hitreg.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's update follows a slump in its share price that's been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/">partially attributed</a> to lower-than-expected interest in XDefiant, and comes after player claims the shooter was "rushed out". Responding to the latter suggestion back in July, XDefiant producer Mark Rubin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/defiantx-producer-says-players-should-stick-around-but-admits-right-now-theres-a-lot-of-bugs">insisted</a> that wasn't the case - instead blaming teething troubles on a game engine "that was designed for something else", and admitting to "a lot of bugs".

<p>
"We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years," continued Rubin. "If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you that's ok you can move on."

			<p>The concept of a dedicated <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> is an interesting one, not least because I’m pretty sure that most people play Jackbox games with a bunch of dirty jokes and swear words anyway. At least in the groups I play with, while we might start clean, everything eventually descends into naming anatomical parts of human bodies in as crude a manner as possible, and then most people giggling like school children who’ve just learned their first naughty word.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB) | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Jackbox Naughty Pack includes three games, which you’ll note is notably fewer the five games that are typically featured in a bundle. Each of these has been designed to bring out the rudest and most adult themes and jokes going. Wait, no, that’s not quite right. Two of these are actually older games, albeit good ones, with more adult prompts, and one is a brand-new game that doesn’t quite land. I adore these Party Packs, so it pains me to say that this one just doesn’t hit right.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the golden oldies. Fakin’ It All Night Long is a dirty version of Fakin’ It, where you have to lie a lot and try not to get caught out. It’s still a great game , but it feels like a really weak inclusion here because, well, we’re all adults anyway, so most Jackbox games of Fakin’ it would end up with some R-rated undertones anyway.</p>

<p>The same is then true of Dirty Drawful. Drawful is an all-time classic of a game, the unusual prompts leading to even more unusual drawings, and the inevitably unusual titles that people come up with for them. We’ve seen Jackbox revisit the idea a couple times, with the standalone Drawful 2 and then Drawful Animate in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/the-jackbox-party-pack-8-review-job-job-drawful-weapons-drawn-best-games/">Party Pack 8</a>, and so Dirty Drawful is immediately familiar. It’s a filthy take on the classic drawing game that just adds in a few naughty prompts, and again… we were all doing this anyway, and everyone knows it. None of us are free from sin.</p>

<p>The new game, and the final one in the pack, is Let Me Finish, a presentation game, which will always depend a little bit on how confident your group is, and also how good at improv they often are. That being said, me and my friends are all incredible charming, funny, attractive, generous, and humble, so I’m not worried about that. This game pits players up against each other while they try to present scenarios about what your washing machine gets up to at night. It’s a fun enough idea on paper, but man, it just feels sort of trite and forced.</p>

<p>And that’s the lot. There’s just three games in this bundle, and with two of them being reskins and prompt packs for older games puts a whole lot on the shoulders of Let Me Finish. There’s not much space for innovation and trying new ideas when you’ve only got one crack of the whip, and a lot of the excitement for each new Party Pack is seeing new ideas and themes. Not all of them land, but then there’s always a couple of highlights. You don’t get that here.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, and while the bar is pretty high on the whole – tee hee – that doesn't change the fact that this just feels like a miss. It certainly doesn't help that there's only three games and two of them reskins, but maybe what's funny about being pure filth in normal Jackbox games is that you're doing it even if the game isn't winking and nudging you constantly. Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.	</p></div>

Fans have also asked to be able to pick the Chaos Space Marines Legion they want for every class in the game. This is currently not possible, which means that unlike the playable Space Marine Chapters, the Chaos Marine Legions are locked to a specific class.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Addressing this request, Focus and Saber said there were “many lore restrictions” preventing the development team from doing this. “For instance: we cannot make a sniper with a World Eater armor.”</p><p>There are additional challenges here, too, that have to do with the variety of Chaos Marine Legion armor types compared to the relatively consistent Space Marine armor.</p><p>“It is very tricky to match armor pieces for Chaos,” the companies said. “Armor pieces have different sizes and styles, will clip through each other, etc. Also, in PvP it is important to be able to recognize an enemy’s class, and we want to keep the visual identity of each of them. Now, we will not keep it as it is and would like to expand Chaos customization, but the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The reality is [Chaos] won't be as modular as the Loyalist.</p></div><p>That’s that for Chaos, then. But what about other issues with the game? The teams are working on the significant matchmaking issues, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-dreaded-joining-server-bug-makes-co-op-play-much-harder-than-it-should-be">which IGN has reported on</a>, as a “top priority,” with a bigger patch planned soon.</p><p>Improvements are also coming to the AI bots, which most players consider to be useless (“bots seem a bit passive because we don’t want them to take the spotlight from the player”), alongside tweaks to the veteran difficulty.</p><p>There are also balance changes outlined (the Blocking weapon trait, which inexplicably does not let you perfect parry, will be changed), the bullet spongy feel of enemies on higher difficulties will be tweaked, and various balance changes for PvP are incoming.</p><p>The update is also interesting because it rules certain requests out. Don’t expect full Battlebarge and Thunderhawk customization any time soon, for example. Restricting Operations Mode to not having two of the same class (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together">we’ve reported on the trouble this causes currently</a>) will remain for regular matchmaking, but “we are considering it as an expansion of private lobbies in the future. It will take us time to finish it.” The dev team is currently focused on improving matchmaking so players will not matchmake with players of the same class, which should help.</p><p>There’s also a plan to combat toxic players who kick teammates late during a game (incredibly frustrating!) to let their friend get the XP.</p><p>And what about new classes, perhaps the most-requested feature from players (Apothecary please!)? “That is definitely something we are heavily discussing. Adding a new class is quite heavy on production as we also need to create all the customization, PvP Chaos model variant, and animation set depending on what we go for. We'll keep you updated about this topic.”</p><p>Space Marine 2 players have asked for a field of view (FoV) slider and left / right shoulder swap features. Here’s what the team had to say on each:</p><p>“FoV slider is not something we are comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game. And on top of that, it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing. Still, we understand that is a very popular request so we are considering it anyway.</p><p>“As for the shoulder swap, if we are to implement shoulder swap we will need to support it for all melee animations and transitions because everything in melee combat was made based on the fact that you hold pistol in the left hand and melee weapon in the right hand (because it looks badass). Nevertheless, shoulder swap is a feature we will not add in the game.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam.</p></div><p>Here’s an interesting one: some players have called on the developers to add invincibility frames (i-frames) on gun-strikes (high damage shots only possible after staggering an enemy). This won’t be added, however. “Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam. We specifically did not put an i-frame on it for balancing reasons, and we are not looking to change this intention.”</p><p>Meanwhile, we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>. Season 2 runs from October until the end of 2024, and includes a new Operations map, a new enemy, a harder difficulty level, a new weapon, and various other improvements. We also have a story on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>the probable enemy faction for the inevitable Space Marine 3</u></a>, and a story on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-youtube-comment">Saber’s refusal to say whether an 'imposing morals on gamers' YouTube comment is from its CEO</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/18/a18468b9407c3de92af500bac7e0f07bdc13140d-1726674254856.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 First Q&amp;A:</h2><p><strong>CONNECTIVITY ISSUES</strong></p><p>We know some of you are experiencing server issues, loss of saves or impossibility to connect with friends. We are ramping up our server capacity to reduce the load on them, and are working day and night to reduce the issues. This is a top priority for the team. A bigger patch is planned soon to improve this topic further, alongside new content.</p><p><strong>AI BOTS</strong></p><p>Question: Bots are regularly mentioned as inefficient, making solo games significantly harder, and you suggested we work on them. According to you, they don’t participate in focusing on objectives or don’t do enough in tense situations.</p><p>Answer: Bots seem a bit passive because we don’t want them to take the spotlight from the player. However, they can sometimes be a bit too passive. In the next patch, we have a few improvements of their behavior against boss fights in the campaign. We are also considering improving their involvement during specific objectives in the campaign for a later patch.</p><p><strong>CAMPAIGN</strong></p><p>Q: Veteran difficulty is said to be too hard in solo as the bots don’t help with the objectives.</p><p>A: We will adjust Veteran difficulty in a future patch. It will remain challenging but it will be slightly more fair because we will tweak AI aggressiveness on this difficulty. Other difficulties will remain untouched.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PVE…</strong></p><p>BALANCING</p><p>Q: Assault is often listed as less powerful than other classes: the jump pack in PVE loses its versatility compared to the one in the campaign.</p><p>A: We are still collecting data on this issue to see how we can work on it.</p><p>Q: The Blocking weapon trait is seen by the community as a bad thing for melee weapons as it removes the potential for mastery (because there is no “perfect” parry window).</p><p>A: We fully agree that this is a bummer, and we’ll definitely make changes in a future patch.</p><p>Q: Bolt Rifle family is underperforming while Melta Gun is considered OP</p><p>A: We have noticed a bug where the Melta allows the user to heal above the contested health, we aim to fix this in the next patch. As for the rest of weapon balancing, we hear you, and some weapons can underdeliver on the power fantasy at higher difficulty levels. We also recognize that enemies can be too bullet spongy on higher difficulty, which is not much fun. That’s the core issue, rather than the bolters themselves. For now, we are testing some tweaks in difficulty to make the enemies have less health but keep the engaging difficulty.</p><p>QUALITY OF LIFE</p><p>Q: You asked to be able to have several of the same class, in Operations mode. There is also frustration in matchmaking when two players want to be the same class.</p><p>A: For now, we are focusing on improving matchmaking so that you will not matchmake with players of the same class. This is not an easy fix, so it will take us some time to roll it out. As for using the same class, we don't want to change that rule for regular matchmaking, but we are considering it as an expansion of private lobbies in the future. It will take us time to finish it.</p><p>Q: It was observed that players tend to show toxic behaviors as they get kicked late during a game made by a group of friends to let their friend get the XP.</p><p>A: We understand this is unfair, and each player will receive XP based on his actual involvement in the mission.</p><p>Q: Saved loadouts don’t include skill tree customization, making them less relevant.</p><p>A: This is not a priority for us at the moment.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PVP…</strong></p><p>MATCHMAKING</p><p>Q: You have suggested making it possible to tag as a squad of 6.</p><p>A: We understand this need. We want to add custom PvP lobbies and give players more control over the match (for example: frag limit, class restriction, etc.). It's not that easy to make and it takes time! So please bear with us while we work on it, and we will let you know when we have clearer visibility on when it will be released.</p><p>BALANCING</p><p>Q: It was brought to our attention that shock grenades are OP. Also, many of you consider melee to be underpowered.</p><p>Q: Assault is considered weak in PVP. Bulwark is overpowered in capture zones. And, Heavy is overpowered: too much damage for its durability.</p><p>A: Regarding pvp balancing, we are currently reading and crunching the data. We don't want to make rash decisions before seeing the global picture. At the moment we are checking the most common topics such as melee balancing, shock grenades, bulwark &amp; heavy being too present in capture game modes. Expect some tweaks in the first big content patch but not before.</p><p>Q: No team balancing after matches creates unbalanced matches for several matches in a row.</p><p>A: We have heard this many times, and we want to improve this in future patches. We are looking into it!</p><p>SPAWNING</p><p>Q: Spawning locations can create spawn-kill situations.</p><p>A: This will be tweaked with some parameters in a future patch. We will implement spawn protection.</p><p><strong>MOST UPVOTED TOPICS ON FOCUS TOGETHER</strong></p><p>Q: Are we getting new colors for the lenses?</p><p>A: New lens colors are planned and coming soon in the next big patch!</p><p>Q: You asked to pick the Chaos Space Marines Legions you want for every classes:</p><p>A: There are many lore restrictions preventing us from doing this (For instance: We cannot make a sniper with a World Eater armor). It is very tricky to match armor pieces for Chaos. Armor pieces have different sizes and styles, will clip through each other, etc. Also, in PvP it is important to be able to recognize an enemy’s class, and we want to keep the visual identity of each of them. Now, we will not keep it as it is and would like to expand Chaos customization, but the reality is they won't be as modular as the Loyalist.</p><p>Q: Many of you have asked for new classes:</p><p>A: That is definitely something we are heavily discussing. Adding a new class is quite heavy on production as we also need to create all the customization, PVP Chaos model variant, and animation set depending on what we go for. We'll keep you updated about this topic.</p><p>Q: About the missing armor colors:</p><p>A: We aim to expand specific color masks, such as hand, decals or facemask, in upcoming patches. We will be adding all successor chapters eventually. ;)</p><p>Q: Adding new melee weapons:</p><p>A: New melee weapons would definitely be an extremely cool addition. Making a weapon and designing it is fine, but we need to make all finisher animations for it. It will take time.</p><p>Q: Customizing your Marine’s face:</p><p>A: Not a quick fix, but we will add an option to change your Marine’s face!</p><p>Q: Optimizing PvP Crossplay:</p><p>A: We need more time to discuss that. Custom PvP lobbies will solve a good part of the issue.</p><p>Q: Thunderhawk Customization:</p><p>A: Doing full Battlebarge and Thunderhawk customization is very cool but not up in our priority list. We prefer to focus our art teams on creating new maps.</p><p>Q: Pyreblaster in PvE or PvP:</p><p>A: We will add it but it will take time because of visual and gameplay progression. We’ll keep you updated!</p><p>Q: To be able to customize the AI squad mates:</p><p>A: Still in discussions.</p><p>Q: Delete Custom Armor Profile:</p><p>A: We worked on this. In the next patch, you will be able to overwrite a custom preset with a default one.</p><p>Q: FoV Slider and Left / Right Shoulder swap:</p><p>A: FoV slider is not something we are comfortable with, as it can degrade the visual aspect of the game. And on top of that, it is very complex. Our game is not a first person shooter, the camera that we have is very cinematic and constantly changes position and FoV based on what you are doing. Still, we understand that is a very popular request so we are considering it anyway.</p><p>As for the shoulder swap,if we are to implement shoulder swap we will need to support it for all melee animations and transitions because everything in melee combat was made based on the fact that you hold pistol in the left hand and melee weapon in the right hand (because it looks badass). Nevertheless, shoulder swap is a feature we will not add in the game.</p><p>Q: Get rid of class restriction on cloaks and tabards:</p><p>A: These are part of class identity; you get to recognize snipers because of those elements.</p><p>Q: I-Frames on gun-strikes:</p><p>A: Gun-strikes are a risk/reward action, and it is very easy to spam. We specifically did not put an i-frame on it for balancing reasons, and we are not looking to change this intention.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-inquisition-massively-oversold-internal-ea-projections-ex-bioware-dev-reveals<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age Inquisition</a> was far from a commercial failure, a former BioWare developer has insisted while revealing an updated sales figure for the game.</p><p>Fantasy action role-playing game Dragon Age Inquisition launched in 2014 to critical and commercial success, enjoying the biggest launch in Bioware history based on units sold. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review">Dragon Age Inquisition review</a> returned an 8.8/10. We said: "Dragon Age: Inquisition doesn't spin a great tale, but it brings the series closer to its roots with deep RPG systems."</p><p>Now, 10 years later, former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah, who left BioWare in 2020, has revealed that Inquisition has sold over 12 million copies, and “massively” oversold EA’s internal projections for the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah I'm not sure where "DAI was a commercial failure" came from...<br>Its over 12 million at this point.<br>MASIVELY oversold the internal EA projections<br>...<br>Oh yeah and was GotY in 2014.</p>— Mark Darrah (@BioMarkDarrah) <a href="https://twitter.com/BioMarkDarrah/status/1836034762332340630?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Why would Darrah say this now? The ex-BioWare staffer took to social media to counter claims from one user that Inquisition was a “commercial failure.” That comment emerged from a social media conversation about the Dragon Age series apparently losing its “super serious and grimdark” tone following the release of the first game in the series, 2009’s much-loved <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Origins</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>That feeling is fueled by an ongoing debate about <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>’s stylized look and action-oriented gameplay, which in truth the series has been pointing towards ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> came out in 2011. The long and short of it is that some Dragon Age fans long for the bloodier, darker cRPG-styled Origins, while The Veilguard is more the natural evolution of Inquisition, a game that had already left Origins behind in gameplay and art style terms and, as Darrah has explained, enjoyed enormous commercial success in doing so.</p><p>The Veilguard launches a decade after Inquisition, and IGN’s exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-first-hands-on-preview">Dragon Age: The Veilguard hands-on preview</a> offers a really helpful look at what to expect from the game.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
