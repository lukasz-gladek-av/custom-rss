			<p>A new The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim mod was <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130669?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last week by renowned modder doodlum, adding NVIDIA DLAA and AMD FSR 3.1 support alongside ENB compatibility.</p>
<p>For over a year, players have been able to use PureDark's <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-dlss2-fsr2-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution mod</a> (later <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-mod-for-tes-v-skyrim-is-out-now-alpha-build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded to support DLSS Frame Generation</a>) with native rendering as a form of DLAA. However, that mod was not compatible with ENB. Moreover, PureDark's mod also added AMD FSR 2, which did not support a native rendering solution, unlike the newer FSR 3.1. You can check out an image comparison below.</p>

<p>Here's the description provided by the modder (who also ported Starfield's clustered shading to TES V with <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-light-mod-greatly-improves-visuals-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another Skyrim mod</a>, allowing for virtually unlimited dynamic light sources; however, that mod is incompatible with this DLAA/FSR 3.1 mod):</p>
<p><em>If DLSS is compatible, then NVIDIA DLAA will automatically be enabled. Otherwise, AMD FSR 3.1 Native AA will be enabled. Both are running natively on D3D11.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod works by directly replacing the game's temporal anti-aliasing. Unlike the Skyrim Upscaler, it runs before some post-processing effects and uses more optimal hooking methods, resulting in improved performance. There are no additional requirements or menus. Instead, you can view the current active anti-aliasing method in the ENB menu under ANTIALIASING. This mod does not hook ENB, nor has it reverse-engineered it in any way. Due to the nature of the hooks, it is incompatible with Community Shaders, so it automatically unloads if ENB is not loaded. </em><em>This is an open-source mod. If you would like to implement new anti-aliasing methods or improvements, then please make a pull request on GitHub.</em></p>
<p>There is a downside. While doodlum implemented NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation in the mod, the modder added that it does not work due to incompatibility with ENB. As such, he advises players to use the Lossless Scaling tool instead.</p>

            <p>Merry mid-October all! It's chucking it down here. This week I'm mostly playing a game of my own devising called There's A Hole In My Raincoat And I Can't Find It. The Maw is unlikely to be sated by such flotsam, so it's just as well there are also a bunch of new PC games on the cards. Please run your eyes over them while I experiment with putting my coat over a lightbulb again.</p><!--more-->
<p>On Monday 14th October, embrace the permadeath potential of bonzai windmills in minigolf roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384660/Up_to_Par/">Up To Par</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rare's next game, Everwild, has been in a sort of limbo for a long time. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in late 2019 during the X019 event, it immediately captivated fans for its gorgeous visuals (vaguely reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) and for its basic idea of 'allowing for new ways to play in a magical world.' In the debut trailer, characters seemed to befriend various animals rather than hunt them as usual in games.</p>
<p>It all sounded a bit vague, though, and there was a good reason for that. In July 2020, Rare studio head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-gameplay-ideas-are-still-being-brainstormed-says-rare-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the Everwild team was still very much brainstorming ideas on what the gameplay would be.</p>
<p><em>I think with Everwild, Louise O’Connor and her leadership team are really passionate about giving players a world that they can just lose themselves in — you know, a lot of nature feels magical. So the notion of, ‘What does it mean to nurture a world? What does it mean to be in nature?’ Part of the reason we haven’t talked a lot about Everwild is because we’re still feeling a lot of these things out. We’re still playing around with gameplay ideas.</em></p>
<p>The following year, the situation started sounding less and less optimistic. According to a reliable report from VGC, Rare had <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">restarted</a> development from scratch, and there were also a few key changes in the team's composition, with Sea of Thieves Director Gregg Mayles joining as the new Creative Director. The rumor said the studio was 'optimistically' targeting 2024, which obviously didn't pan out. Indeed, in late 2021, two more insiders<a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> chimed in</a> to say Everwild was 'a real mess', with the studio reportedly still unsure what to do with it.</p>
<p>After nearly three years, Windows Central's Jez Corden, who's usually very well-informed on all things Xbox, has provided a brief update during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LXVqIAErbM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday's episode of the Xbox Two podcast</a>.</p>
<p><em>I heard that development on Everwild is going well. They've nailed the gameplay loop now and we should be seeing that in the future.</em></p>
<p>Of course, there's no telling when that might be. The Game Awards is coming up in two months, though if it doesn't make it there, Microsoft could always decide to show it on their Xbox Developer Direct in January 2025. Then again, the January event has been so far dedicated to showing off games that are close to launch, and we have no indication that's the case with Everwild. As such, next Summer's Xbox Games Showcase might be a better fit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rare <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-season-14-adds-new-ways-to-be-stealthy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to update Sea of Thieves</a> for the many pirates still enjoying it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/aaero2-review-let-rhythm-hit-em</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/aaero2-review-let-the-rhythm-hit-%E2%80%98em.1008783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/aaero2-review-let-rhythm-hit-em<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s any genre that showcases an immense variety of talent and dedication, it’s rhythm-action. From <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/thumper-review-space-beetle-and-violent-rhythm"><em>Thumper</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crypt-of-necrodancer"><em>Crypt of The Necrodancer</em></a>, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/avicii-invector">Invector</a> </em>to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hi-fi-rush"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a>, the creativity is staggering, and the rush? Unequaled. There is one game not mentioned however that finally gets its time in the spotlight with the release of its sequel: <em>Aaero2</em>.</p>
<p>This is the follow-up to 2017’s underground rhythm-action hit <em>Aaero</em>, developed by UK-based studio Mad Fellows, composed of former Harmonix developers Paul Norris and Dan Horbury. Your adventure as a little ship has you traveling through abandoned worlds and alien architecture while fighting off against hostile droids and creatures through the power of melody.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played the original <em>Aaero</em>, you’d be doing yourself a disservice for missing out on one of rhythm-action’s shining jewels, and personally, one of my favorite games of all time. It’s an audio-visual experience whose closest comparison – the aforementioned <em>Thumper </em>– occupies a diametrically opposite space across from <em>Aaero</em>. Whereas <em>Thumper </em>induces innate rhythmic fear, <em>Aaero </em>resides in untamed melodic bliss.</p>

<p>Gameplay in <em>Aaero </em>involves your ship being placed on a cylindrical highway, where you must connect to ribbons of light in order to attain a high score. In moments of intensity, enemies will begin to attack you, and in response, you lock onto them with your heat-seeking rockets, with grace periods and a bonus score attached if you manage to do it in rhythm with the beat of the song.</p>
<p><em>Aaero2 </em>sees the stakes amped up, but not without a few quality-of-life additions, like a secondary machine gun to quickly take care of overwhelming amounts of enemies, at the cost of a smaller score. At first, you’ll feel as if you’ve been conned, but <em>Aaero2 </em>manages to make the rhythm more accessible by providing a beat timer when locking onto enemies with the rocket launcher.</p>
<p>As a sequel, <em>Aaero2 </em>goes above and beyond to commit to expansions while still feeling like a continuation of times past. The songs are more difficult, the environments are more varied, and the threat is doubled, even tripled at some points. It’s a miracle that barely any of it is at the expense of deterring newcomers or alienating veterans, a great example of that being in the tracklist.</p>

<p>While the original <em>Aaero </em>was largely dedicated to dubstep, EDM, and jungle, <em>Aaero2 </em>experiments with a few more genres, namely on the metal side of things. When a guitar solo pops up for the first time early on, you’ll be shocked if you’re familiar with <em>Aaero</em>’s aesthetic, but the execution is fantastic, tapping into Mad Fellows’ past with <em>Guitar Hero</em> &amp; <em>Rock Band</em> flavors, and it synthesizes brilliantly with the aesthetic.</p>
<p>When comparing the two soundtracks side-by-side, <em>Aaero2 </em>excels over its predecessor due to variety, both in sound and in chart structure. With the aforementioned guitar leads, there is an unmistakable vision of clarity on Mad Fellows’ behalf, where they’ve begun to fully realize exactly what’s possible with their central mechanic, which <em>Aaero</em> always felt like it was on the cusp of.</p>
<p>The combat also excels with the same parameters as enemies no longer feel like filler, but the beat reincarnated as an adversary. However, on harder difficulties, the higher number of enemies and their frequency tend to come across as a kitchen-sink approach, and flow feels like an arbitrary sacrifice of demand rather than one that comes from a natural extension of ability.</p>

<p>It also doesn’t feel as fast as the previous <em>Aaero</em>, but this feels more like a conscious decision to improve on the formula. While it’s still devastatingly difficult, neither game promises perfection as an attainable goal, even with <em>Aaero2</em>’s new “ribbon magnet” for lower difficulties. With 3 difficulties available to earn, alongside a “Chill” mode where you can simply vibe to the audio-visual experience, the new leveling system attached to a profile helps progression flow whether you’re a master or not.</p>
<p>Still, if you want to put your skills to the test, then you can with <em>Aaero2</em>’s new co-op and PvP functionalities, which is a make-or-break angle for the game. With both modes, your ship will be paired alongside an orange variant, with each of you having color-set ribbons of light to score points from, sometimes swapping between song sections to score points separately.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t work. At its peak, it feels busy, even bloated when enemies are thrown in large droves and progress flashes up on the middle of the screen to notify who won a particular period of the song. Yet that peak also shares player synchronicity, and you will never feel more in tune and alive than when you and your partner rotate in perfect symmetrical balance; in dances of light and fire.</p>

<p>In regards to its busy nature during high-speed and quick-tempo sessions and sections, Mad Fellows have done well to reduce the noise inside and outside the central gaming area. Whereas the original <em>Aaero </em>was brighter, shinier, and spikier visually, the direction of travel itself would become an obstacle in discerning upcoming information. In <em>Aaero2</em>, the game has a lot more moving parts, but integrates them into the environment and that changes how it feels to interact with the world more positively.</p>
<p>Honestly, Aaero2’s biggest flaw comes from constant UI issues. Sometimes, the game will simply forget which menu you’re on, and what you’ve unlocked, and catch itself in an inescapable loop that can usually only be solved by a full reset. This isn’t an issue exclusive to <em>Aaero2 </em>either, as the original <em>Aaero </em>also suffers from this, so old habits die hard.</p>
<h2><em>Aaero2 </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>Still, it’s those old habits that got Mad Fellows to make <em>Aaero2 </em>begin with, and it spawns a newfound creative angle for which their gameplay can soar. Not only is it an upgrade far above whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/aaero-review-invite-me-to-wedding-next-time"><em>Aaero </em>could achieve in median</a>, but actively replaces it as one of rhythm-action’s most prominent examples of creativity, involvement, and sheer joy. Per aspera ad astra.</p>

<p>Activision’s enforcement teams continue to innovate and find ways to reduce the levels of ‘online toxicity’ across the Call of Duty ecosystem. Most recently, the platform saw the introduction of ToxMod, an AI-driven digital moderation engine that automatically detects abusing comms and reports it.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed that since ToxMod was rolled out in June 2024, ‘disruptive voice chat’ has dropped by 43% since the start of the year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-old-ways">The Old Ways</h2>



<p>Any Call of Duty veteran will baulk at the idea of having an AI representative moderate their voice and text chats. It can be argued that toxicity and trash-talking are woven into the very fabric of Call of Duty. It doesn’t take much to get a veteran to rant about ‘today’s players not surviving in MW2 Search lobbies’.</p>



<p>Activision’s ToxMod technology has reportedly brought about a decrease of a whopping 67% in repeat offenders using the game’s voice chat function to abuse other users. It was referenced that in July 2024, one month after the deployment of ToxMod, 80% of players who were issued an enforcement <strong>did not </strong>re-offend.</p>



<p>ToxMod works silently in the background to monitor all communications running through Call of Duty, acting on them and reporting any malfeasance to a centralised body of human representatives. If needed, action will then be taken.</p>



<p>It has been <strong>claimed </strong>that ToxMod is so intelligent that it can figure out the difference between friendly and edgy banter and genuine insults, identifying the difference by analysing the tone and sentiment of what someone is saying. It’s clever enough to identify the severity of a comment based on the response from other users.</p>



<p>It’s not a <strong>bad thing</strong> that it exists, but it’s going to slow down those hot-headed Call of Duty players with a penchant for slamming other players midway through an intense Search and Destroy series.</p>



<p>Will Black Ops 6, which is due to hit the market on October 25, be the first toxicity-free Call of Duty game <strong>ever</strong>?</p>

<p>It was a few days ago that Rockstar revealed this year’s Halloween-themed event in GTA Online – Ludendorff Cemetary Survival. It’s a blast from the past that delivers GTA 5 fans a zombie survival mode that they’ve been craving for more than a decade, and it has gone down remarkably well with the community.</p>



<p>In recent hours, the concurrent player count on the Ludendorff Cemetry Survival mode peaked at over 1.2 million users. That’s a testament to the fact that after more than a decade, Grand Theft Auto fans are still <strong>very </strong>hungry for more content.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fight-them-back">Fight Them Back</h2>



<p>The Ludendorff Cemetary Survival mode is one of the most engaging events in GTA Online’s ten-year history. In this mode, players must band together and unite against waves of bloodthirsty zombies, making use of a range of weapons and power-ups to take on hordes of the undead.</p>



<p>It’s a clear callback to Red Dead’s Undead Nightmare DLC, which featured a mode exactly like this one.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://stats.gtao.gg/?contentId=Ev15vTKgxU6-Eg6atOSQlg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GTAO Stats</a>, the number of plays for the Ludendorff Cemetary Survival map has soared over the weekend, hitting 2.6 million plays in total – 1.2 million of which were unique. It’s not clear just how reliable this data is, but a cursory glance at social and streaming platforms will tell you all you need to know.</p>



<p>It could be said that GTA Online and Grand Theft Auto 5 are in their twilight phase now, preparing to wind down and be replaced for the next decade or so by Grand Theft Auto 6. It has been almost a year since the first trailer for GTA 6 was released, and fans are still chomping at the bit for more information about the game.</p>



<p>We may see a new trailer revealed at The Game Awards in December – but don’t quote me on that.</p>



<p>Did you give the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival mode a run yet? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Secret Level was unveiled at the recent Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, with Blur Studio lifting the lid on an ambitious project incorporating several recognisable franchises. Secret Level is an animated series in which every episode is based on a different game: God of War, Unreal Tournament, Warhammer, and so on. </p>



<p>We’ve had a few teaser trailers released in the last couple of months, but most recently, a leaked ‘work-in-progress’ trailer emerged online, revealing several key cast members, including Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-blown-wide-open">Blown Wide Open</h2>



<p>The leaked Secret Level trailer, which surfaced from a Telegram server and <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trailer-for-video-game-anthology-series-secret-level-leaks-cast-includes-arnold-schwarzenegger-and-his-son" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was circulated by MP1st</a>, showcases more of the franchises that have found a spot in the project. It’s a long list, and the potential of Secret Level is almost unparalleled – there are so many video game series to draw from to populate the universe.</p>



<p>In the trailer, the vocal talents of several high-profile actors are revealed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Arnold Schwarzenegger</li>



<li>Patrick Schwarzenegger</li>



<li>Kevin Hart</li>



<li>Heaven Hart</li>



<li>Keanu Reeves</li>



<li>Gabriel Luna</li>



<li>Arianna Greenblatt</li>



<li>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje</li>



<li>Michael Beach</li>



<li>Emily Swallow</li>



<li>Claudia Domit</li>
</ul>



<p>Some parent-child partnerships are cropping up in Secret Level, it seems. Arnold Schwarzenegger is joining forces with his son, while Kevin Hart’s daughter makes an appearance in the series.</p>



<p>Here’s one of the previously released trailers for Secret Level:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>We don’t have long to wait until the finished trailer is released online – the show itself premieres on Prime Video on December 10, and it promises to offer a little something to everyone, regardless of the kind of games that you enjoy.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles is a new game mode that allows players to not only revisit the iconic moments from the popular anime series but also delve into unexplored storylines. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles will help you better understand all the different branching paths for Frieza.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that there are two types of branches: alternate endings and paths. Completing these branches can earn you extra rewards, such as additional Zeni, XP, items and more. Specific scenarios also play Sparking! Episodes which are original cutscenes created for these unseen moments. This guide will highlight all the branching paths and alternate endings for Frieza’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles and explain how to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-immortal-body">Immortal Body</h2>



<p>The first alternate ending for Frieza’s Sparking Zero Episode battles arrives during ‘A Blast from the Past’ mission. The alternate ending is called ‘Immortal Body’, and to unlock it, you will need to defeat all the fighters before Goku collects enough energy to launch a Spirit Bomb.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you defeat all the fighters quickly, Goku will have no one to help him while collecting energy for the Spirit Bomb. Hence, he will have no option but to participate in hand-to-hand combat. Frieza overpowers him easily and kills his friends and his son on Planet Namek. Once everything is out of the way, Frieza searches for the Dragon Balls and wishes to be immortal. Goku dies before his friends, so he doesn’t turn Super Saiyan in this timeline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-fall-of-the-saiyans">Fall of the Saiyans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The next Sparking Zero alternate ending for Frieza’s Episode Battles arrives during the ‘Legendary Super Saiyan’ Mission. You must complete a hidden objective to unlock the ‘Fall of the Saiyans’ ending. Players must defeat Frieza before he shows his Full Power transformation to trigger this ending.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you beat Goku without transforming into Frieza’s Full Power Transformation, a new Sparking! Episode is unlocked. In this new scenario, Goku is cornered by Frieza and uses one last Kamehameha to finish the job. However, that’s not enough to defeat Frieza, and Goku dies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frieza finally gets what he wants and manages to wipe out the Saiyan race. He declares himself the strongest in the universe, expanding the Frieza Force’s hold all over the cosmos. Frieza also loses interest in becoming immortal after defeating Goku. However, he does start training as he doesn’t want to drop from the top spot.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-rematch-with-goku-nbsp">Rematch with Goku&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The next alternate ending for Frieza’s Sparking Zero episodes can be unlocked during the ‘Frieza Descends on Earth’ mission. You must complete the hidden objective to unlock the ‘Rematch with Goku’ ending. The hidden objective is to defeat Future Trunks before the match ends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new scenario will play out if you can defeat Future Trunks before the match ends. Trunks is defeated in the battle against Frieza, which leads to Goku getting ambushed as soon as he returns from Yardrat. Frieza manages to beat Goku, overcoming the power of a Super Saiyan. After beating Goku, he kills every mortal on Earth and extends his reign of terror across the galaxy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-frieza-joins-the-fray">Frieza Joins the Fray</h2>



<p>The last one is an entire branching storyline for Frieza called ‘Frieza Joins the Fray’. To unlock this path, players must defeat Goku and Vegeta before Frieza’s Golden Transformation is undone during the Frieza Revived mission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new Sparking Episode plays if you can defeat Goku and Vegeta before Frieza’s Golden transformation is undone. In this timeline, Frieza overpowers Goku and Vegeta and is almost about to end their life along with the planet. That’s when Beerus steps in, stopping Frieza from destroying Earth.</p>

<h3 id="h-frieza-s-conditions-nbsp">Frieza’s Conditions&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Frieza questions why a Destroyer God would protect life, to which Beerus replies, stating he still has use for the planet. Beerus asks Frieza whether he is thankful that he achieved this new form because of the people on Earth. To which Frieza replies that it is true; this Golden Form wouldn’t have been achievable if he didn’t have the Saiyans to defeat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frieza accepts not to destroy Earth but applies two conditions for doing so. The first one requires Beerus not to interfere with any Frieza Force activities. The second condition is for Frieza to use Earth’s Dragon Balls to revive the fallen Frieza Force members. Beerus agrees to both conditions, adding that Frieza is now the strongest person in the universe after him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Frieza now starts training his revived soldiers, which includes all the minions Goku and Vegeta had defeated in the past, even the Ginyu Force.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-tournament-of-power-nbsp">Tournament of Power&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Sometime after, Beerus approaches Frieza, asking him to join the Tournament of Power. Frieza has a condition again; this time, he wants to choose some of the team members for Universe 7. You can choose between Dodoria and Zarbon, King Cold, The Ginyu Force, and Cooler.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The choice really doesn’t change much. Universe 7 always ends up winning the tournament; only the battles leading up to them are different, along with some interesting exchanges between the characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-gohan-black-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Sparking Zero: Gohan Black Guide</a></p>



<h3 id="h-choosing-your-teammate-s">Choosing your Teammate(s)</h3>



<ul>
<li>Choosing Dodoria and Zarbon will lead you to clash with Kakunsa, Bergamo and Frost. Dodoria and Zarbon will defeat the rest of the enemies, and Frieza will have the energy to defeat Jiren to save Universe 7.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you choose Cooler, you fight against Hit. After winning against the Ultimate Hitman, the brothers dominate the Tournament of Power, defeating all other Universes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>If you choose King Cold, he will try to recruit the Saiyans from Universe 6 to the Frieza Force. You will fight Cabba, Kale, Caulifla, and the fused Kefla on this path.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Lastly, if you choose the Ginyu Force, Frieza will recognise a similarity between them, the Pride Troopers and Universe 2’s Ribrianne, Kakunsa and Rosie. The similarity is none other than their fighting poses. Frieza proceeds to insult the posers and then ends up fighting Ribrianne and Toppo.</li>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the best-looking open-world games released in recent years, thanks to mods that enhance the game's visuals to unprecedented levels.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NextGenDreams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGen Dreams</a> shared a new 8K resolution video showcasing the game running with path tracing and the DreamPunk 2.1 mod, one of the most demanding graphics configurations ever created. The mod's new version overhauls the graphics configuration, indirect lighting, light diffusion, LUT saturation, and much more to offer incredibly realistic visuals that look incredibly realistic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077: Realism Unleashed in 8K with DreamPunk 2.1 Graphics Mod | Gameplay &amp; Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhVI5zMR1Y0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As development of Cyberpunk 2077 has concluded, it will be up to modders to continue improving the game. Still, CDPR is still providing minimal support to its game, as last month, official support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-amd-fsr-3-bad-visual-quality/">AMD FSR 3</a> was added to the game. Sadly, CDPR went with an older version of the upscaler which doesn't deliver many improvements over FSR 2.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the Phantom Liberty expansion and the massive 2.0 update which overhauled much of the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s Episode Battles are this series’s new story mode, allowing players to experience the anime’s iconic moments and explore some never-before-seen scenarios. This Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles guide will help you better understand all the different branching paths for Future Trunks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future Trunks’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles have several branching storylines, and two offer a set of Super Dragon Balls each. Players should know that completing these branches will reward them with additional rewards, such as Zeni, Xp, and other items. This guide will highlight all the branching paths for Trunks’ Episode Battles and explain how to unlock them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-shining-hope-nbsp">Shining Hope&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The first branching storyline for Future Trunks arrives during the ‘Twisted World Mission’ when you’re battling Zamasu and Black Goku. To unlock the ‘Shining Hope’ path for Future Trunks, you will need to reduce Zamasu’s health quickly, and a great way to do that is by using combos until you can go in Sparking! Mode, then riddle him punches until the last Ki bar is left, and that’s when you use Future Trunks’ Super Attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you manage to beat both characters in the given time, a new scenario triggers. In this scene, Trunks doesn’t stay back to fight Zamasu and Black Goku to help Vegeta and Goku leave. Instead, he returns with them and learns about the Evil Containment Wave from Piccolo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future Trunks then returns to the timeline and must battle the immortal Zamasu. Trunks ends up trapping him in a container with the Evil Containment Wave if you defeat him and then joins Goku and Vegeta to fight Black.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-desire-to-protect-nbsp">Desire to Protect&nbsp;</h3>



<p>However, Black seems unfazed by this, stating that he alone is enough to carry out the Zero Mortal plan and that he can always find a replacement Zamasu with the help of the time rings. Now, you must defeat Black Goku in his Rose transformation to finish Zamasu’s reign of terror.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future&nbsp;Trunks and Black have a colossal beam clash, and Vegeta joins in to back his son. Vegeta then provides some final motivational words that push Trunks over the edge. Trunks wins the battle, and finally, a mortal overcomes a god.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trunks hands over Zamasu’s container to Universe 10’s Supreme Kai Gowasu and then lives peacefully in his timeline while keeping up with his training. We never see Fused Zamasu in this timeline, as Trunks traps him before Black and Zamasu can Fuse. This means we don’t see Super Vegito either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-trunk-s-choice">Trunk’s Choice</h2>



<p>This alternate storyline is available after the main events of Future Trunks’s Sparking Zero Episode Battles are over, after the ‘Trunks’s Choice’ mission. After defeating Black and Zamasu, Trunks returns to Goku and Vegeta’s timeline, and Bulma asks him to stay back. You will have the choice of ‘Staying in the Present’ or ‘Go Back to Your Timeline’; choosing the latter will follow the events from the anime, and Trunks’s Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Episode Battles will conclude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you decide to Stay Back, Future Trunks will ask Vegeta to train him one last time, and Gohan and Piccolo will join this training. This mission is called ‘To Become Strongest in the Universe’, and Trunks has to showcase his powers to all three fighters to complete it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-to-become-strongest-in-the-universe">To Become Strongest in the Universe</h2>



<p>There are two alternate endings to this Future Trunks’ mission, one where you only showcase your powers to the three fighters and then return to your timeline a bit stronger than before. The second ending is unlocked when you showcase your power quickly to Vegeta, Gohan and Piccolo, which means getting through them much faster. If you succeed, a new path is unlocked, called Inherited Pride.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-inherited-pride-nbsp">Inherited Pride&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once unlocked, a new cutscene plays, where Gohan admits Future Trunks has outclassed him in terms of power and even with his Potential Unlocked, he still might not be able to beat Trunks. After this exchange with Gohan, Future Trunks decides to stay in the present for some more time, and a little while later, Bulma gets pregnant. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is also the same time the Tournament of Power arrives, so Goku tries to convince Vegeta to join the Universe 7 team. He refuses at first as he doesn’t want to leave Bulma alone, but after Whis delivers the baby instantaneously with his angelic powers, Vegeta agrees to join the team.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Future Trunks embraces his sister, Bulla, for the first time during this moment. He also overhears a conversation between Gohan and Yamcha, where it’s revealed that the tournament winner can make a wish with the Super Dragon Balls. This information piques Trunks’ interest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-future-trunks-join-the-tournament-of-power">Future Trunks Join the Tournament of Power</h3>



<p>Future Trunks then decides to join the Tournament of Power, hoping to use the Super Dragon Balls to revive his fallen family and friends from his timeline. He trains with Vegeta to learn how to fight without his sword, as weapons are prohibited. Finally, the day of the tournament arrives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this scenario, Gohan is still leading Universe 7, and just like last time, Goku and Vegeta leave the pack to find the stronger fighters. Here, you are presented with another choice, either ‘Stay with Gohan’ or ‘Help Vegeta’, and both paths provide a set of Super Dragon Balls each, so once you finish the first path, make a Super Shenron wish and then return for the second path.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-help-vegeta">Help Vegeta</h2>



<p>If you decide to help Vegeta, you must fight against the Saiyans of Universe 6, and Cabba and Trunks have a meaningful interaction here. The next battle is with Kale and Caulifla, and once you defeat them, Toppo will jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new Sparking! Episode plays where Vegeta arrives to help out Trunks, and then the father-son duo give it their all against Toppo. They manage to overcome Toppo’s God of Destruction powers, and at the same time, Goku and Android 17 sacrifice themselves to get Jiren out. As Vegeta and Trunks were the last fighters on the stage, Universe 7 won.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the time comes to make a wish with the Super Dragon Balls, Trunks realizes that bringing back all the destroyed universes was the only path here, thanks to Vegeta instilling that into him. Completing this path will provide you with the ending of Inherited Pride.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-stay-with-gohan-nbsp">Stay with Gohan&nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you choose to stay with Gohan, you must confront Kale and Caulifla again. This time, Kale goes berserk and fights Goku. After that battle, you will have to defeat Toppo and Dyspo. They will ambush Future Trunks, but Android 17 and Android 18 will come to his aid. At this point, Trunks realizes these Androids are very different from those in his timeline, and they have compassion for the fighters, their families, and their universes.</p>



<p>Android 18 sacrifices herself to remove Dyspo, and Jiren gets rid of Kefla. Future Trunks and Vegeta are able to take care of Toppo; however, Vegeta is knocked out by Jiren later. Now, it’s Jiren versus Earth’s fighters. An intense battle begins, but Earth’s warriors fall short against Jiren. In the dying moments, Gohan sacrifices himself to save Trunks, which makes Future Trunks angry enough to take the fight to Jiren.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trunks, Goku, and Android 17 are able to beat Jiren in the end, thanks to Android 17’s brave move. The match ends, and Future Trunks wishes to restore all the universes and then returns to his timeline. By Staying with Gohan, players received the Embarking Toward Tomorrow Ending. Moreover, as Trunks fights in the tournament, there’s no need for a 10th fighter, and Goku does not need to ask Frieza for help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You must unlock both endings, Inherited Pride and Embarking Toward Tomorrow, to receive the two sets of Super Dragon Balls. Players should note that Super Dragon Balls cannot be stacked, so use the wish before collecting the next set. </p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s director of publishing, Michael Douse, has called out scalpers for "making [people] sad".</p>
<p>Although the official website still <a href="https://ce.baldursgate3.game/">shows</a> the physical PC and PS5 collector's editions for Baldur's Gate 3 were priced at £217 (€260) before they were promptly snapped up, scalpers are trying their luck and listing the collector's editions on auction sites for thousands of pounds.</p>

<p>Appending an image that showed someone trying to flog their collector's edition for £2.9K (€3.4K), Douse said he "understand[s] how commodity works", but stressed that the point of releasing collector's editions like this is "to make someone happy".</p>
<p>"Hate scalpers, man," Douse said on X/Twitter (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-3-collectors-edition-scalping-called-out-by-larian/">TheGamer</a>). "I understand how commodity works, but this CE isn't a commodity, it's designed to make someone happy, not rich.</p>

        <p>"It is time to break away from the past and start a new chapter."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Yet another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> legacy project has been announced.</p>
<p>Summer Eternal is a new studio from Argo Tuulik, a former ZA/UM developer cited as having co-created Disco Elysium's worldbuilding. It is the third ZA/UM-adjecent outfit to have used Disco Elysium's fifth anniversary on 11th October to announce their next steps.</p>
<p>If you're struggling to keep track of everything, you're not alone, but this appears to be the fifth - fifth! - Disco Elysium offshoot, with three of them all announced on the same day. The others include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">Longdue</a>, a new independent studio comprising staff from Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">Dark Math Games</a>, a studio describing itself as a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium". </p>
<p>Writer and designer Robert Kurvitz also established Red Info in 2023 with artist Aleksander Rostov. And then there's ZA/UM itself, of course.</p>

<p>Tuulik was the last remaining writer to have contributed to Disco Elysium <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">to have been let go earlier this year</a> following the cancellation of a Disco Elysium standalone expansion.</p>
<p>Tuulik has teamed up with fellow Disco Elysium writers Olga Moskvina and Dora Klindžić, as well as voice actor Lenval Brown, senior concept artist Anastasia Ivanova, designer Michael Oswell, and Gamechuck's former MD, Aleksandar Gavrilović.</p>
<p>"We must be living at the dawn of a cultural Golden Age, when like mushrooms after rain the companies promising 'the next Disco Elysium' are popping up every hour on the hour," Summer Eternal said in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/now-theres-another-disco-elysium-spin-off-studio-and-this-ones-coming-out-with-some-proper-fighting-talk">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>"It's a sure sign that the fifth anniversary of the release of this monumental game is approaching, and every corporation wants a piece of the fortune.</p>
<p>"However, often forgotten in this money lust are the creatives themselves, first instrumentalised for press releases and afterwards underpaid, silenced, bullied, sued, abused... But it is all of us - the creatives, the workers, the players - who should be holding control over the means of our creation and who should be celebrated on this day.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we announce today our own vision of a worker-owned co-operative, a complex structure that will ensure that not only moneylenders but every worker, every creative, even every player, has a seat at the table."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tuulik is keen to stress that this project will <em>not</em> be a Disco Elysium sequel.</p>
<p>"It will definitely not be a Disco Elysium sequel!" Tuulik said. "It is time to break away from the past and start a new chapter.</p>
<p>"It will be a completely new setting and story with new mechanics. But end of the day, we are who we are, and RPGs are what we will make - do what you will with it :)"</p>
<p>"I believe that the last time around, we made something genre-breaking," Tuulik added. "Discipline-transcending. Something completely new. I am not ready to give up on that.</p>
<p>"The lessons learned, skills developed, experience forged -- for five fucking years, I've been waiting to put them to use. So we went back to the drawing board with one goal in mind - let's do it fresh from the start, but this time let's not fuck each other the moment the checkered flag drops. It makes the entire mankind look bad."</p><p>This seeming rivalry is likely the result of unrest at the studio following the release of Disco Elysium, including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">lawsuit</a>, reports of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">toxic behaviour and IP theft</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">layoffs</a> after a standalone expansion was reportedly cancelled, leading to an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">extremely public legal spat</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Adding a completely new region, Nahantu, along with a wealth of added characters and modes and a brand-new story, the expansion pack is the very definition of a game changer. But it goes even further than that, bringing in entirely new ways to upgrade items, a revamp of the World Tiers, new animal-morphing classes, and a new level cap. However, we meet change without fear, offering a litany of guides to get you up to speed.</p><p>For instance, <em>Diablo IV</em> now has NPC Mercenaries you can hire to come with you on your brawling, but you’re only going to find them by following a specific series of quests. Then there are those Spiritborn classes that let you pick between being able to possess the powers of a Jaguar, Eagle, Gorilla, or Centipede…Wait, <em>centipede? </em>No, we’ve checked, that’s definitely correct—and apparently one of the best choices for end-game content.<br></p><p>And this all follows on from piles of massive changes earlier this year, which saw the introduction of loot-fest The Pit, a new way to improve loot called Tempering, the addition of Mythic Uniques, and Infernal Hordes to battle.

			<p>Two prominent insiders have claimed that the next Xbox Partner Preview event should be announced soon, probably at the beginning of the coming week. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot32-mythologies-histories-prophecies.970347/post-130073664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nate the Hate</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1845384109646020865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1845384109646020865%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a> have both said as much in the spawn of a few hours, lending credibility to the rumor. The last Xbox Partner Preview, which aired on Wednesday, March 6, 2024, was more than seven months ago. This time, the gap was longer, as the second-to-last XPP aired in late October 2023.</p>
<p>The March 2024 Xbox Partner Preview featured the following third-party news:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final Fantasy XIV's release date trailer for the Xbox version that launched on March 21</li>
<li>A gameplay trailer for Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, CAPCOM's action strategy game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on July 19 and appeared on Game Pass from day one</li>
<li>The game reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sinking City 2</a>, a full-fledged horror sequel to Frogwares' action/adventure game released in 2019</li>
<li>The first details on the expansion pass for Persona 3 Reload</li>
<li>The surprise release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, which was finally released for consoles</li>
<li>New gameplay footage for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/unknown-9-awakening-first-gameplay-summer-2024-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unknown 9: Awakening</a></li>
<li>An in-depth gameplay trailer of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></li>
<li>A gameplay trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a>, the upcoming sci-fi survival game by 11 Bit Studios</li>
<li>The reveal of 'creature saver game' Creatures of Ava from Inverge Studios</li>
<li>The reveal of Monster Jam Showdown</li>
<li>The reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sleight-of-hand-is-a-neo-noir-stealth-sim-featuring-a-betrayed-witch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sleight of Hand</a>, an intriguing third-person stealth game</li>
</ul>
<p>As to what might be included in the upcoming Xbox Partner Preview event, it's anyone's guess now. The insiders provided no concrete info. However, we could certainly see more of STALKER 2, which is certainly a title Microsoft has invested a lot in by securing a three-month console exclusive. GSC Game World's long-awaited first-person shooter/survival horror game is set to launch on PC and Xbox Series S|X on November 20.</p>

Now, <a href="https://www.gamefreak.co.jp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/info20241010.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Freak has published a statement</a> confirming that the breach is accurate, stating that 2,606 employees were impacted.</p>



<p>The firm has stressed that the vulnerability that led to the leak has already been patched up, but the data is changing hands online – and there’s no getting it back.</p>



<p>One of the most tantalising pieces of information to come from the leak concerns the next generation of Pokémon games. In the files, references to ‘K’ and ‘N’ are revealed, along with a project codenamed ‘Synapse’, which some users have claimed is a Pokémon MMO being pieced together in collaboration with another, unnamed studio.</p>



<p>Retro fans have started poring over leaked source code for DS-era Pokémon games like Black and White 2, HeartGold, and SoulSilver. These particular leaks have caused never-before-seen images and cut assets to surface. Some of these images concern concept art for starter Pokémon, and characters that never saw the light of day.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, eagle-eyed gamers have uncovered references to Legends ZA and even some details about what’s coming next for Switch 2.</p>



<p>Even now, this story continues to develop.</p>

With the platform holder keeping its content roadmaps close to its chest, the comments were largely taken out of context and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/08/ps5s-lack-of-tentpole-exclusives-isnt-hurting-engagement-says-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many assumed this would be a lean year</a> for the company’s new-gen console.</p><p>While it’s true this has been a fairly quiet year for PS Studios, it’s been anything but light on the games front. At the time of writing, my three <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/tags/game-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game of the Year</a> frontrunners are <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/astro-bot-guide-full-walkthrough-and-all-collectibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guide-walkthrough-and-best-gear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/metaphor-refantazio-guide-character-progression-side-content-and-collectibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and the PS5 is the <em>only</em> platform where you can play all three. Other possible contenders for awards include <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/silent-hill-2-guide-full-walkthrough-puzzle-solutions-and-all-collectibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helldivers 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/black_myth_wukong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Myth: Wukong</a> – all console exclusives.</p><p>There seems to be a sentiment on social media that a game doesn’t count unless it comes from a wholly owned first-party studio, but PlayStation has done a particularly good job of working with partners to keep its portfolio packed this year.</p><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/stellar-blade-guide-a-full-100percent-walkthrough" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Blade</a> is a great example.

Its complete misreading of the market with first-person shooter <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/concord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concord</a> – <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/concord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a competent albeit uninspiring affair</a> – will go down in history after <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/sony-flop-concord-axed-two-weeks-after-ps5-pc-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting axed after two weeks</a>. And yet for all the talk of its live service initiative stumbling, it launched <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/05/helldivers-2-on-ps5-pc-is-sonys-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fastest-selling game in PS Studios history</a> with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/helldivers_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helldivers 2</a>, an online co-op smash that, despite benefitting from a simultaneous PC launch, has outpaced juggernauts like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/marvels-spider-man-2-guide-walkthrough-best-upgrades-and-all-collectibles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/god-of-war-ragnarok-guide-walkthrough-all-collectibles-and-wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">God of War Ragnarok</a>.</p><p>It’s been a quietly colossal year for PS5 then, and you get the sense the best is yet to come. The company’s largely kept its blockbusters close to its chest but 2025 should see the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ghost_of_yotei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost of Yotei</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvels_wolverine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> waiting in the wings. These are the “major existing franchise titles” the Japanese giant was referring to in that aforementioned investor call.</p><p>Many may still argue this has been a light year for PS5 but the catalogue of content Sony has amassed paints a very different picture. The most exciting thing is that it’s successfully filled the time while its first-party teams continue to cook. A huge second-half to the generation now awaits.</p><p><em>Sammy Barker is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Push Square</em></a><em>.
