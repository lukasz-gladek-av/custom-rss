<figure><a title="fc 26 switch 2 port" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ade2224325b10/fc-26-switch-2-port.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: EA Sports</em></figcaption></figure><p>Now, we know that the folks behind big AAA sports game releases — and especially yearly ones where they really have to scrape the barrel and make up new words like 'TruMotion' and things of this nature to keep us interested — like to engage the pre-release hype train. It's part of life, it's part of nature. It keeps the soul warm and the planet spinning.</p>
<p>However, speaking to <a href="https://gamerant.com/ea-sports-fc-26-nintendo-switch-2-performance-powerful-good/">Game Rant</a> a few days ago (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-switch-2-power-ea-sports-fc/">NintendoEverything</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> dev Andreas Wilsdorf has been rather unexpectedly verbose in his claims on just how nicely his latest football game is running on Nintendo's new machine. To the point that it almost feels a little too good to be true, especially when considering how some of the game's beta and show-floor demo players seem to be finding things.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rygsxq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>During an interview about the game with line producer Wilsdorf and career mode design director Pete O'Donnell, Wilsdorf said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"In general, the Switch 2 was really exciting. Being on the platform with FC this year, the performance is what really excites us. It is on parity, basically, with what we see on PS5 and Xbox. Again, it's a [handheld] console, but the first time I played with it, I was really impressed. Then, we also saw it working on the simulation and the times it takes to simulate the season and so on, which was very, very close to what we saw in PlayStation and Xbox devkits. That's really impressive."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, of course, this is fantastic news on the face of things, but it doesn't mesh with some of the real-world evidence that we've been presented with elsewhere. Indeed, there has been a beta of the game running on Switch and Switch 2 (we didn't get a code, unfortunately), and players of that version have been reporting in on the game's Reddit forum with their impressions:</p>

<p>As you can see from this particular post, it seems as though the game hasn't been impressing everyone, although it is impossible to 100% confirm that these people are actually playing the Switch 2 version, rather than the Switch 1 beta - there has been some confusion it seems, and elsewhere other early beta players have an entirely different take on the experience:</p>

<p>Felix Sanchez, one of our intrepid video producers, got to go hands-on with the game at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> recently and came away unimpressed after playing in docked mode. "It felt almost exactly like 25 on Switch," he says. "Sure, it ran stable, but it's still running at what seemed like 30fps and the graphics are quite a downgrade compared to other platforms."</p>
<p>After years of disappointing '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">Legacy</a>' versions of FIFA on Switch, EA finally delivered an up-to-date, feature-rich game with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">EA Sports FC 24</a>, and we were hoping Switch 2's power would open up possibilities for the series that weren't possible on older Nintendo hardware. With just a few weeks to go, and as much as we want to believe it's gonna be as good as Mr Wilsdorf says, the 30fps gameplay (which would be a disaster for many excited FC fans) and the expected excision of crossplay have got us interested to see how it turns out when the oven bell finally dings on September 26th. Or even sooner, if we get a demo.</p>

Pitchford also expressed the desire to bring more Gearbox games to the platform, though he wouldn't elaborate any further than that on this topic.</p>



<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an awesome, awesome machine – I'm so grateful for it. It's less about innovating and more about perfecting, and giving us what we want and what works. I love my Switch, and I kind of wanted a more powerful one with newer games. When I got the briefing and realized, 'oh, it's more than that, Nintendo has invested a lot, not just in the hardware, but in the software, and making it easier than ever to connect with other people. This is getting exciting.</em></p>



<p><em>I love Switch, and I love my Nintendo Switch 2, and I think that without getting in trouble and trying to talk about things that are from the future, we love making games, and we love entertaining people, and we want to be on the platforms where the people that want us to be are. And Nintendo just had the most successful new console launch in the history of video game consoles, and I don't think that's slowing down.</em> <em>I love that platform, and I want to bring more games to it, but it's really not the right time for me to talk about games that are down the road.</em></p>



<p>As far as we know, Gearbox <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-and-brothers-in-arms-games-listed-on-developers-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working</a> on a new Brothers in Arms game and possibly Tiny Tina's Wonderlands 2, a sequel to the 2022 spin-off featuring the titular Tiny Tina as the 'dungeon master'. The completion status of these projects is currently unclear.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/now-three-times-cheaper-than-its-original-price-this-roborock-is-going-for-the-price-of-a-budget-model-2000622070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/now-three-times-cheaper-than-its-original-price-this-roborock-is-going-for-the-price-of-a-budget-model.1286271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock is celebrating its 11th birthday and instead of just blowing out the candles, the company is going to be giving the gifts to its customers. For a limited time, the entire line of smart robot vacuums is available with massive discounts and the discounts are so good that <strong>most of the models have reached their record low prices</strong>.</p>
<p>Among these, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/">Roborock Q8 Max is our favorite, and it’s currently on sale at $179, down from $599</a>. It’s not the newest model in the series but in<strong> terms of value for money it’s unbeatable</strong>, which is also why it’s the company’s best-selling unit in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3842/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Everyday</h2>
<p>The powerful suction, <strong>which is 5500 Pa</strong>, is one of the first things you notice and it gives it the cleaning capability that’s usually reserved for high-end devices. Dust, crumbs, tiny particles and embedded dirt in carpets all disappear just as easily as lighter material resting on hardwood. Supporting this power is <strong>Roborock’s DuoRoller brush system</strong> that’s a smart twin roller design that’s resistant to hair tangling and rolls easily across a range of surfaces. For pet owners, this is peace of mind that the vacuum won’t be choked after a single pass through a hairy patch in the living room.</p>
<p>But a robot vacuum is more than just brute force, because if it doesn’t clean intelligently, performance quickly becomes frustrating: That’s where the Q8 Max differs from bargain-class machines. With Roborock’s PreciSense LiDAR navigation system, <strong>it accurately scans and maps the home</strong>, and builds a detailed layout that allows it to map routes logically. Combined with obstacle detection technology, the Roborock Q8 Max neatly avoids cords, toys, and table legs, so it gets stuck less and has more time actually cleaning.</p>



<p>Another reason this model has been so popular is that it does not just vacuum,<strong> it also mops and it does both in a single pass</strong>. The onboard electronic water tank has thirty levels of flow control so you can adjust the mop output to clean anything from sensitive hardwood to tile. This means beyond a surface touch-up, you get a deeper clean without needing to switch devices or start multiple cycles.</p>
<p>Battery life and independence are also crucial to the experience: The <strong>5200 mAh battery offers up to four hours of runtime from a single charge</strong>, and covers areas as large as 300 square meters in one go. To further simplify upkeep, the automatic dust-emptying dock holds weeks’ worth of debris in its 2.5-liter sealed bag. For most households, that means quite literally <strong>not needing to consider bin emptying for nearly two months</strong> as your robot does the lion’s share of the floor cleaning quietly in the background. Add in Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri compatibility, and it is a home companion that responds to voice commands without demanding attention in return.</p>
<p>That’s why the Q8 Max has been the best-seller for Roborock.</p>
<p>With Roborock celebrating its 11 years of innovation, getting the opportunity to grab the Q8 Max at this all-time low&nbsp; price point makes it a no-brainer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2 has received a brand new update today, patch 01.004.000, which introduces randomly-generated cave systems, new missions, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2’s Discord was recently discussing co-op split-screen as a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technically feasible</a>” feature, with many players hoping it will arrive as one in a new update. We didn’t get split-screen, but Arrowhead has released a massive update, which will have players exploring Terminid Hive Worlds, exterminating abhorrent new enemy types, and completing new missions. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-update-adds-randomly-generated-cave-systems-new-enemies-and-more">Helldivers 2 Update Adds Randomly-Generated Cave Systems, New Enemies, and More</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-hive-worlds">Hive Worlds</h3>



<p>As mentioned, Helldivers 2’s new update will have players exploring Hive Worlds, which are randomly-generated giant cave systems that pose a new tactical challenge. While exploring these caves, players will find new disgusting flora and fauna as well as advanced Terminid life. Players will discover acid lakes and advanced bug spires on the Hive World surface, and there will be hols in the room to use the stratagems. Walls are destructible, making it slightly easier to navigate in these caves, but they will surely be dark and scary. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-missions">New Missions</h3>



<p>The new update will task players with exploring the deepest corners of these caves and destroying the Spore Lung to stop its infectious Gloom from spreading. Players will need to take over the GATER mobile oil rig to extract the mysterious oily substance from these Hive Worlds. Lastly, many missions will require players to collect resources and destroy enemy threats to these caves. </p>



<h3 id="h-new-enemies">New Enemies</h3>



<p>Coming to the new enemies in the latest Helldivers 2 update 01.004.000, players will be faced against four new types: Rupture Spewer, Rupture Warrior, Rupture Charger, and Dragonroach. The Spewer emerges from the ground to “spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent”. The Warrior is a Gloom-induced mutation that prefers open-air movement. The Chargers tunnel through the ground at high speeds. Lastly, the Dragonroach is an oversized creature that flies and circles its prey and can also spew air-combustible acid. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Set coordinates for the Terminid Hive Worlds – and pack the extra-strength bug spray. We’re exterminating the galaxy’s most disgusting infestation in a patriotic payback mission of no mercy.</p><p>Abhorrent new enemy types, thrilling missions, strange worlds and spectacular beasts… <a href="https://t.co/WDD7qFeWro">pic.twitter.com/WDD7qFeWro</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1962802722517786694?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<h3 id="h-balancing-and-fixes">Balancing and Fixes</h3>



<p>Several new balancing changes have been made, including buffs to the Orbital Smoke, Orbital E.M.S., and Mortar E.M.S. stratagems. Moreover, stratagems, throwables, and Boosters like Mortar E.M.S., Orbital E.M.S., Stun Grenade, Urchin, and Stun Hellpod have had their stagger strength increase. Conversely, all of their stagger impulse have been reduced to zero. </p>



<p>A plethora of fixes have been implemented across various aspects of the game, including Crashes, soft locks, weapons, stratagems, enemies, missions, and miscellaneous areas. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-in-helldivers-2-01-004-000-september-2-update">All Patch Notes in Helldivers 2 01.004.000 September 2 Update</h2>



<h3><strong>New Additions</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Hive Worlds</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Randomly-generated giant cave systems</li>



<li>A new tactical challenge</li>



<li>Discover disgusting flora and fauna and advanced Terminid life</li>



<li>Hive World surface – acid lakes and advanced bug spires</li>



<li>Holes in the cave roof will allow stratagems to be called down</li>



<li>Destructible walls within the caves to navigate</li>



<li>Bring a flashlight!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Missions</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Delve deep into the caves to destroy the Spore Lung and stop its infectious Gloom spread</li>



<li>Take control of the GATER mobile oil rig and siphon the mysterious oily substance from the surface of Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Undertake more missions to extract resources and destroy the enemy threat on Hive Worlds</li>



<li>Have Super Earth approved levels of fun!</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Enemies</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Rupture Spewer; The foul Rupture Spewer bursts from the ground only to spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent. Upon returning to its dark warrens, it is believed to consume its own dead in order to generate more of its corrosive acid.</li>



<li>Rupture Warrior; A product of Gloom-induced mutation, the Rupture Warrior has lost the UV-insulating chitin layer that would protect its internal organs from solar radiation damage. Captured specimens prefer burrowing to open-air movement, a pattern indicative of subconscious shame at their own undemocratic ways.</li>



<li>Rupture Charger; When this armored beast senses the presence of Liberty, it buries itself underground to escape its light. Its Charger instincts compel it to tunnel through the ground at high speeds, emerging only to attack those who represent the Liberty that blinds it so.</li>



<li>Dragonroach; This oversized affront to Free skies everywhere circles its would-be prey, swooping down intermittently to bespew them with air-combustible acid. A spineless tactic befitting an exoskeletal monstrosity. </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-balancing"><strong>Balancing</strong></h3>



<p>Unified “non-explosive Orbitals” so they have the same projectile damage and destruction values as the Orbital gas. This effects:</p>



<p><strong><br>Orbital smoke</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Increased Projectile Damage&nbsp; 0 → 300&nbsp;</li>

<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Orbital E.M.S</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Increased Projectile Damage 250 → 300&nbsp;</li>



<li>Increased Projectile AP 3 → 7</li>



<li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength 30 → 50</li>
</ul>



<p>Unified Stun explosions work. They all apply the stun effect on the explosion and not only on the status effect volume. This effects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Orbital E.M.S</li>



<li>Mortar E.M.S</li>
</ul>



<p>Changed how all stun explosions work in that they now initially stagger the enemy they stun but also without ragdolling the player if hit by such an explosion</p>



<p><strong>Throwables</strong></p>



<p>Stun grenade</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 0 -&gt; 50</li>

<li>Decreased stagger impulse 15 -&gt; 0&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Stratagems</strong></p>

<li>Increased stagger strength 10 -&gt; 50</li>



<li>Decreased stagger impulse 40 → 0</li>
</ul>



<p>Mortar E.M.S</p>



<ul>
<li>Increased stagger strength 10 -&gt; 50</li>



<li>Decreased stagger impulse 40 → 0&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Fixed a rare crash caused by multiple players having the MA5C AR equipped on the super destroyer</li>



<li>Fixed crash that could occur during hot-joining</li>



<li>Fixed a rare crash that could occur when dropping backpacks</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fix flickering VFX shadows in some areas.</li>

<li>Fixed chat typing animations – Helldivers no longer suffer from fat fingers and will use their writing pads when typing chat messages.</li>



<li>Fixed the Adreno-Defibrillator status effect not affecting Helldivers inside combat walkers</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where the planetary hazard damaged Hellbombs will visually appear to explode twice when shot by GL-21 Grenade Launcher, from the shooter’s POV</li>
</ul>

            <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> Unlimited, a community project that aims to make Ubisoft racer The Crew playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, have announced a release date.</p>
<p>If you need a bit of a refresher, Ubisoft's decision to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">take The Crew's servers offline</a> in March 2024 rendered it totally unplayable even for those who own a physical copy, due to its online-only nature. That's since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">served as the spark</a> for the Stop Killing Games campaign <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-stop-killing-games-supported-eu-petition-now-closed-the-campaigns-loudest-voice-reckons-its-done-about-as-well-as-is-humanly-possible">we've reported on</a> as its organisers have petitioned lawmakers across the world to ensure companies are required by law to put concrete end-of-life plans in place, when they decide to switch a game's servers off. It also set a group of Crewers off on a quest to make the game playable again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For a year or so, The Crew Unlimited's devs have been working towards that goal. They've now announced a release date for their creation, which comprises of a server emulator designed to stand in for those Ubisoft took offline. As per an announcement on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1412163460955115520">Discord</a> from project lead whammy4, it'll come out on September 15th, 2025, and be distributed for free to minimise the chances of the publisher directing their lawyers to intervene.</p>
<p>"We were trying everything we could, anything to preserve the game," reads The Crew Unlimited's freshly published <a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/about/">website</a>. "We eventually came to the conclusion that writing a server emulator for The Crew was the best and only solution. This would allow us to effectively implement both an Offline Mode and an Online Mode back into the game, Offline Mode simply being a local server running on your computer while playing the game. Your local server, your local savegames, your game. No one will ever be able to take this away from you now."</p><p>The Crew Unlimited'll be grabbable from that same site once it's live, and you'll need to have owned The Crew on PC before to access it, as the devs won't be illegally distributing game files. You know, because that'd almost definitely result in Ubisoft's lawyers coming down like a ton of bricks. Though, the project's <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ</a> does see them admit that they've got no way on their end of telling a legit copy from a pirated copy, so they'll have to let all players in regardless, which sounds far from ideal.</p>
<p>In a Discord discussion linked in the FAQ, the devs have made some notes about what works in terms of re-downloading your old The Crew save files. I'd say players may well be in for a tricky time getting things up and running. The devs say you'll need to start from scratch unless you only want to play offline, and have already used a tool they developed to dump your save prior to the game's shutdown.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they also hint that their online server may harbour a few additions or changes. That said, the group insist tweaks outside of any new stuff would be limited to "technical improvements and careful rebalancing", and that they'd "never change the core experience of the game".</p>
<p>All in all, even though the project's been public info for around a year now, with whammy4 having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIo4l-BpK8s">posted videos of them driving around in it</a> to YouTube, it's maybe worth waiting to see how the release plays out before you give it a go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>No Man’s Sky is enjoying a huge resurgence on Steam following the anniversary update released last week, reaching heights it has not been at in years.</p>



<p>Initially released in 2016, No Man’s Sky endured a troubled launch, but has established itself as one of gaming’s biggest comebacks in the years since, following a wealth of free updates.</p>



<p>The most recent, the Anniversary Update, launched on August 28 and in the days since, the playerbase on Steam has seen a huge spike in its playerbase.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-hits-highest-peak-since-launch">No Man’s Sky Hits Highest Peak Since Launch</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Shining light. Image via Hello Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/275850/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB data</a>, No Man’s Sky hit a peak of 98,285 concurrent players yesterday, September 1, the highest total that the game has seen since it’s release nine years ago.</p>



<p>The numbers are narrowly ahead of July 2018, the previously post-release high that saw 97,000 concurrent players, but have edged past that number to set a new post-launch record.</p>



<p>Although still some way off the all-time peak of over 212,000 players on Steam from launch, it shows that the dedicated work from Hello Games has not gone unnoticed, with players still keen to enjoy the massive adventure across the stars.</p>



<p>The signs are certainly promising for Hello Games ahead of the release of Light No Fire, the upcoming title for the studio that has been teased, with a release date yet to be set.</p>



<p>Light No Fire is the sixth most wishlisted game on Steam, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, beneath only Hollow Knight: Silksong, Subnautica 2, Deadlock, Borderlands 4, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>With many of those games due to be released in the coming months, Light No Fire could rise further up the charts.</p>



<p>Have you been lured back into No Man’s Sky following the most recent update? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Like previous Borderlands games, Gearbox Software has big plans to keep players invested in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> well after they've wrapped up the campaign and all of its side missions. Free and paid DLC are on the cards, as players can expect new expansions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">new Vault Hunters</a>, and an endgame that will be updated weekly.</p><p>For the paid content, Story Packs will flesh out the planet of Kairos with post-launch narrative content. Two Story Packs are scheduled to be released in 2026, with the first one planned for release in the first quarter of the year. Gearbox says its first Story Pack will be a bloody, cosmic-horror-inspired tale entitled Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned. As the title suggests, this DLC will star Moxxi's daughter Ellie, a trend that will continue in future DLC drops as players can expect to see a few familiar faces pop up.</p>

<p>There'll also be multiple main missions and side missions set inside a new zone set inside a new zone of Kairos included in these Story Packs, as well as a brand-new Vault Hunter, new gear to earn, and a bunch of new cosmetics to unlock. Gearbox says more details on the mystery Vault Hunter will be revealed during the Tokyo Game Show later this month.</p><p>While Story Packs are planned to be <em>big </em>drops, Bounty Packs will offer bite-sized narrative content to dig into. These will give players new gear and cosmetics to earn, as well as a Vault Card that lets you unlock additional loot through gameplay. Each mission in a Bounty Pack will reveal more about the various NPCs of Kairos and give you a new Boss to take down, as well as a Vault Card that gives you more loot and XP via daily and weekly challenges when it's active. Gearbox says that each Vault Card is built around a distinct theme and can be leveled up at your own pace, as there are no time limits or expiring rewards here.</p><p>As mentioned above, this content is available through the Deluxe and Super Deluxe Editions of Borderlands 4, as well as through bundles or individual purchases. For the free content, Gearbox says that it will continue to support the game with updates and Invincible Bosses will also be coming to the game. These are bosses with <em>massive </em>health pools, unique mechanics, and capable of dealing lethal amounts of damage, so you're going to want to have your Vault Hunter prepared for a serious fight. It's worth taking on an Invincible Boss, as they'll drop some of the best loot in the game when they're defeated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560073" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560073"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4560073-borderlands-4.jpg"></figure><p>Borderlands 4 will also include multiple types of free weekly content, such as:</p><ul><li><b>Weekly Big Encore Boss</b>: Visit Moxxi's Big Encore Machine, spend some Eridium, and take on a tougher variant of a boss who'll offer greater rewards upon defeat.</li><li><b>Weekly Wildcard Missions</b>: In this community challenge, all players will get the same Weekly Wildcard Mission added to their map. These have a guaranteed Legendary drop that you can repeatedly earn until you get your god-roll.</li><li><b>Maurice's Black Market Machine</b>: The talking Saurian Maurice returns in Borderlands 4, and once a week, he'll offer Legendary loot for in-game cash if you can find his Black Market Machine.</li></ul><p>While Legendary-class drops will be rarer in Borderlands 4, expect the return of Pearlescent-grade gear to be even more elusive. The crème de la crème of loot, Pearlescent items will be added to Borderlands 4 in Q1 2026 and these will boast some of the best stats and power in the game.</p><p>Gearbox will also cycle in seasonal mini-events throughout the year, kicking off with the Halloween-themed Horrors of Kairos later this year. The developer says that these will tweak the gameplay and give players new cosmetic items and new Legendary gear to chase after. Finally, the Borderlands 4 endgame will see free updates roll out to Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. If you can overcome the challenges of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, Gearbox says you'll get the best loot rolls in the game.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S--as well as Switch 2 in October--and in case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailer-urges-you-to-quit-earth-and-i-really-wish-i-could/1100-6534380/">Gearbox recently released a new live-action trailer</a> encouraging fans to exit Earth and head over to Kairos.</p>

<p>Starting with Snake Eater, Konami's remake for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S has reached number 1, with the PS5 enjoying a whopping 93% of the platform split. Gears of War: Reloaded, meanwhile, is only listed for the PS5 because, well, it didn't receive a physical release on Xbox. What a weird world we're living in...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is still performing well at number 2, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has fallen down to number 6. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Outrageously Long Game Title</a> also made its Switch 2 debut this week and sits at number 7, with the new version enjoying 85% of the platform split when compared to Switch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4urqlkw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

			<p>The first look at a never-before-seen Battlefield 6 map has been provided today by a new leaked video.</p>



<p>The video, which has been shared by the same user who provided the first look at the game's Battle Royale map yesterday, showcases the Blackwell Field or Blackwell Farm map, a mostly flat map featuring a unique atmosphere. Sadly, the player doesn't do a very good job showcasing the map in full due to their playstyle and high FOV settings, but those eagerly anticipating the game's release next month will surely appreciate taking a look at a map that will supposedly be part of the game's very first season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Although it took EA and the many development teams working on the game to unveil it, the long wait hasn't damped the excitement surrounding Battlefield 6, as proven by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/">incredible numbers</a> pulled by the open beta held last month. Some data gleaned from the testing phases also revealed how many PC users taking part in the test ran the beta client on minimum specs and lower, highlighting the need to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/">optimize for weaker systems</a> to allow as many users as possible to enjoy the game as intended. With this being one of the focuses of the developers, it was not surprising to hear the game won't support ray tracing and likely never will, to focus on performance, which is definitely the right choice for a competitive shooter.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on October 10.</p>

              <p>Hideo Kojima is celebrating ten years of his Kojima Productions company with a lengthy livestream and live show later this month. Beyond the Strand will take place on September 23 at the TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Toyko, and be livestreamed out to the gorgeous masses, where the developer promises “glimpses into future projects.”</p> <p>It’s a somewhat premature celebration, given Kojima Productions wasn’t officially founded until December 16, 2015, but it seems likely the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> creator is itching to speak about what his studio is working on now that <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is out. So far, Kojima Productions has given us two&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em> games, but we know that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/3">a horror game called&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a> is already in the works, starring the extraordinary Sophia Lillis (<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>,&nbsp;<em>It</em>) and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo</em>), as well as&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> spiritual successor <a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><em>Physint</em></a>.</p>  <p>However,&nbsp;<em>Physint</em> is thought to be at least five years away, and there hasn’t been anything to see of <em>OD</em> since the above announcement video. The latter experienced an eight month delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, but is now back in development. So could we be getting updates on these, perhaps even something in-game? Well, given Kojima’s preference for flair and mystery, footage seems unlikely. But given this is scheduled to be two-and-a-half hours long, there’s got to be&nbsp;<em>something</em>.</p>

 <p>There’s also word that Kojima is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">making a movie based on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em></a>, so perhaps there’s news to be revealed on that? Maybe even shots of Norman Reedus falling over on a hill? The developer has also hinted at other&nbsp;<em>DS</em> adaptations, although he’s been incredibly vague about what they could be. There’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/7">been word about other TV or film projects</a> ahead of <em>Physint</em>.</p> <p>The only details about Beyond the Strand we have right now, beyond the “glimpses,” are that there will be “special guest appearances.” Geoff? Oh god, imagine if he&nbsp;<em>didn’t</em> invite Geoff. That’d be such a move.</p> <p>If you live anywhere near Tokyo, <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">tickets for the event went on sale today</a>, September 2, via a lottery system. The livestream details will apparently be announced closer to the event. In the meantime, my absolute favorite detail is in the small print: “<span lang="EN-GB">We cannot be held responsible for any disputes between attendees.”</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-have-been-impacted-by-the-high-price-of-the-playstation-5-capcom%E2%80%99s-president-says.1286196/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sales of Monster Hunter Wilds have been impacted by the high price of the PlayStation 5, and not by any issue the game may have, according to CAPCOM's president Haruhiro Tsujimoto.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/">Automaton</a>, Tsujimoto-san talked with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en">Nikkei Gaming</a> about the sales of the latest entry in one of the most popular gaming franchises ever, which were quite strong at launch, but fell off quickly in the following months, saying that the high price of the PlayStation 5, which the publisher considers the main platform for the game, has impacted its performance on the market. Taking into consideration the price of the system, accessories and the PlayStation Plus subscription required to play online, plus the price of the game, getting to play Monster Hunter Wilds can be costly, especially for young players with no income, so it would make more sense for some of them to get previous entries in the series featuring a lot more content like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a> which can be purchased for far less. As such, the biggest challenge for the publisher will be to make the game as accessible as possible to new players, and it is planning a strategy to take advantage of future discounts to improve sales starting in these final months of the year.</p>



<p>In the same interview, the CAPCOM's president also commented on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying that the system's success was better than the publisher expected, highlighting its lower price compared to Sony's system. The succcess of the new Nintendo console reaffirmed how cost-conscious users are all over the world, Tsujimoto-san commented.</p>



<p>It's a shame Monster Hunter Wilds is not proving to be as successful as past entries in the series, as the game is a more than worthy entry in the series, even with its issues, such as the low challenge level which the development team has been addressing with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">free updates and content</a>. You can learn more about the game now out on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The annual home of hockey returns with NHL 26. One of EA’s many sports licenses is back for another outing on the rink, and if you want to know when NHL 26 releases, we have its launch date and start time details in one handy hub.</p>



<p>EA’s other sports titles are where the headlines usually go: EA FC, Madden, and College Football. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-release-date-platforms-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NHL 26</a> is evidence that the company also boasts the NHL license, and many people still loyally buy it each year. A reworked <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-26-features-include-be-a-pro-and-gameplay-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Be A Pro</a> mode, a revamped ICE-Q 2.0 engine, and X-Factors are integral cogs in the new setup.</p>



<p>If you need a virtual ice hockey fix, then NHL 26 is the one. Let’s check out its release date and when you can start playing it.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-nhl-26-coming-out">When is NHL 26 Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready for a match. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NHL 26 hits the ice on September 12 across both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles.</strong></p>



<p>The game does have early access if you want to play earlier. If you’re waiting for launch, though, you’ve only got a few more days to wait. The NHL franchise is a lot more restrictive where platforms are concerned. Whereas EA FC 26, for example, will release on all PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC platforms, NHL 26 is only on current-gen PS and Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>It’s unclear if this is a cost-cutting measure. Regardless, September 12 is when NHL 26 hits digital and physical shelves, and its launch times vary depending on your region.</p>



<h2 id="h-nhl-26-start-times">NHL 26 Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>According to the official PlayStation Store, NHL 26 will go live from 9 AM PDT on September 12—with other time zones to follow soon after.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0006-PPSA26785_00-NHL26STANDARD000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NHL 26’s PS Store</a> listing suggests a 9AM PDT start time. This could be subject to change, but if it’s not, you know when to prepare for the game’s arrival.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I’ve provided additional time zones below to cover America’s large reach, plus a couple of key zones for worldwide readers. Check out NHL 26’s release times here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">NHL 26 Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Daylight Time (CDT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00 AM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">5:00 PM—September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">2:00 AM—September 13</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Gearbox has revealed what players can expect from the Borderlands 4 endgame when it launches on 12th September for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC – and then 3rd October for Switch 2 – as well as what’s coming down the pipe through the post-launch roadmap.</p>
<p>Once players have wrapped up the main story of Borderlands 4 and, presumably, freed the planet Kairos from its dictatorial leadership, the endgame will have continued activities and progression through weekly challenge missions, character Specialisations, and the returning Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.</p>


<p>Here’s how Gearbox describes this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode</strong> – Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode has been reimagined for its return. This post-game difficulty option will challenge players through five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, applying lessons learned from past franchise entries, this mode no longer requires players to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will move up ranks through curated mission challenges that put their chosen build to the test, growing more difficult through progression and removing the need to re-farm the same gear.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong> – Each rank of Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode includes exclusive Firmware, which are set bonuses for gear that players will first experience throughout the campaign. The more firmware a player acquires results in a higher stat bonus. These powerful Firmware bonuses can be transferred once to another item, at which time the original item is destroyed and the Firmware bonus cannot be re-transferred.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly Wildcards</strong> – Multiple incentives will be provided to allow players to continue their search for the best loot: Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates. Maurice’s Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, with varied loot for every player’s game. Each of these activities is available for online matchmaking by intent, encouraging players to group up with friends, or find new ones whose interests align.*</li>
</ul>

<p>The roadmap for the “first few months” of the game extends through Q1 2026, promising both free and paid content, the latter of which are broken out into story packs and bounty packs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Story Packs</strong> – The first of two announced “Story Packs” features the return of the indomitable fan-favorite Ellie in “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned.” Featuring a cosmic <a title="Genres > Horror [701 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> theme with a bloodier, darker tone, this “Story Pack” includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, all new legendary gear, and the introduction of the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. In addition, this pack brings four new Vault Hunter Skins, two new Vehicle Skins, three ECHO-4 Drone Skins, as well as attachments, and one ECHO-4 Frame.</li>
<li><strong>Bounty Packs</strong> – With the launch of the first “Bounty Pack,” players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> universe. These missions will reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, starting with Rush, the gregarious leader of the <a title="Games > Outbound [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outbound">Outbound</a>ers. Each Bounty Pack includes new Main Missions, a new boss, new Legendary Gear, one Player Skin, one ECHO-4 Drone Skin, one new Vehicle, and a Vault Card, allowing players to unlock 24 Cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable Gear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Free for all players, seasonal mini-events will include the Halloween-y Horrors of Kairos in October, offering new Legendary Weapons, new Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Further to this, Invincible Bosses return in new high-level boss arenas built to make the most of Borderlands 4’s enhanced traversal, with a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode launching alongside each one, and there’s new Legendaries that will serve as the rewards for beating them.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/22/borderlands-4-preview-gamescom-2025/">Borderlands 4 Preview – Guns, grapples and big boss battles</a></h2>
<p>We went hands on with Borderlands 4 at Gamescom 2025, saying, “what I did see from this all-too-brief hands on opportunity was the potential that all of these additions off. Having enjoyed the earlier games in the Borderlands series, but skipping out on the last game, Borderlands 4 looks promising after, and is likely to pull me back into the looter shooter fold when it launches on 12th September.”</p>

            <p>The lead designer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> has announced that he's making something like Left 4 Dead again - a four-player co-op shooter that "expands on the co-op-formula in ways I've wanted to explore for a long time".
</p>
<p>Whatever they end up calling it, the game is in development at Bad Robot Games, a studio founded by the film and TV outfit behind Lost, Cloverfield and Westworld. So the project has both expertise and funding to spare, in theory. There is little else to tell, right now, but you can sign up for a playtest if all this has you combing the rooftops for Smokers and scrabbling around for your shotgun.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Former Turtle Rock creative director Mike Booth announced the project in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/">a Reddit post this week</a>. "If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting," he wrote. 
</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead aside, Booth has credits on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-condition-zero">Counter-Strike: Condition Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>. He worked for Valve after they acquired Turtle Rock in 2008, then left in 2012 to join Blizzard and work on something unannounced. Then he went to Facebook to work on multiplayer virtual reality mcGuffins for the Oculus Rift. Most recently, he joined the board of directors for Resolution, creators of tabletop RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/demeo">Demeo</a>. Here's hoping the new Left 4 Deadlike isn't some kind of VR exclusive, or otherwise tainted by exposure to Mark Zuckerberg's skullfucking metaverse meanderings.
</p><p>"We're still in the early stages of development, but we're opening up playtests to a limited number of players," Booth added in the Reddit post. "If you're interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we'd love to have you involved." You can sign up for a playtest <a href="https://www.badrobotgames.com/invite">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I'm always keen to play anything Left 4 Deadlike, but I have been burned before. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a> was not the unofficial Left 4 Dead 3 its title format implied, partly because it tried to make Left 4 Dead's spontaneously 'AI-directed', playable B-movie gambit work within a clunky latter-day progression system.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">had fun with Back 4 Blood</a>, admittedly, calling it "peak early-00s cheese". And there have been other, recent quatrofoil co-operational bangalongs that pull off something like the old L4D vibe, such as Fatshark's various first-person Warhammer games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a> from 10 Chambers, and dwarven asteroid miner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.
</p>
<p>(Side note to Rock Paper Shotgun's automatic keyword linking system: why do you link some game titles, and not others? Why do you vex and torment me so? I will never unravel your heathen wiles and mocking parlor tricks.)</p>
<p>As for the possibility of an actual Left 4 Dead 3 - those magic words <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/left-4-dead-3-is-a-non-priority-according-to-counter-strike-2-files">appear in relatively recent Valve documentation</a>, but I've seen little evidence that such a project is in active development. Right now, the Steam company appear focussed on perennial chart topper Counter-Strike 2 and the upcoming MOBA shooter Deadlock. As for Booth's old joint Turtle Rock, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-2-appears-to-be-a-thing-which-is-a-shame-because-id-rather-play-a-new-evolve">appear to be making Back 4 Blood 2</a>, which displeases me inasmuch as I'd rather they make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The high price of PlayStation 5 gaming is affecting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> sales, Capcom has said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds got off to an incredible sales start when it launched in February. After releasing to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-breezes-past-10-million-sold-capcom-explains-why-its-done-so-incredibly-well"><u>Capcom record-setting 10.1 million copies sold</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-surpasses-8-million-units-sold-in-3-days-and-is-the-fastest-capcom-game-to-do-so"><u>8 million of which were in just three days</u></a>, Wilds shot up to become the best-selling game in the U.S. year-to-date according to Circana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, for the quarter ending June 30, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 477,000 copies, only just above the 389,000 copies sold of four-year-old game Monster Hunter Rise. Wilds was the 9th best-selling game of the quarter for Capcom, while Rise was the 10th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Capcom's consolidated financial results, the company said: "Regarding catalog titles, although sales were soft for Monster Hunter Wilds, the latest title in the series released in February this year, Monster Hunter Rise, a previous title in the same series, continued to see sales growth."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5s-steep-price-a-barrier-for-potential-monster-hunter-wilds-players-capcom-president-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Capcom president Haruhiro Tsujimoto told <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01186/00001/?wovn=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nikkei Gaming</a> that the cost of entry to play Monster Hunter Wilds on a PS5 is “rather steep.” Indeed, Capcom thought the PS5 was going to be the primary sales platform for Monster Hunter Wilds at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s Automaton:</p><blockquote>In an interview with Nikkei Gaming, Tsujimoto revealed that Capcom considered the PlayStation 5 as Monster Hunter Wilds’ main platform when estimating the game’s initial sales figures. But accounting for the console, accessories, and monthly subscriptions like PlayStation Plus, the total cost for a PS5 amounts to about 100,000 JPY (roughly $677 USD). Add in Monster Hunter Wilds’ $70 USD price tag, and some people would rather pay for older, more complete entries, such as Monster Hunter World (which sells for as low as $9.89 USD) and Monster Hunter Rise ($9.99 USD), than buy a new console for a game with, currently, less content. Considering many gamers are young and don’t have a source of income, Tsujimoto admits the cost of entry to play Monster Hunter Wilds on a PS5 is rather steep.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost of PS5 gaming was made worse last month when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-5-price-rises-for-us">Sony announced $50 price rises for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Digital Edition, and PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. The base PS5 with a disc drive went up by $50 to $549.99, while the PS5 Digital Edition cost $50 more, at $499.99. The PS5 Pro, meanwhile, rose $50 to $749.99. The price hike went into effect in the U.S. on August 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment," Isabelle Tomatis, Sony Interactive Entertainment's Vice President, Global Marketing said in a statement. "As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was no mention of Xbox console pricing in Tsujimoto’s comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s the answer? Discounts, it seems, as well as more content via patches. Perhaps a launch on the record-breaking Nintendo Switch 2 will help, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, actual players of Monster Hunter Wilds might have their own theories as to why the game hasn’t shown the same level of sales consistency as prior Monster Hunter games. After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>reviewing well initially</u></a>, Wilds’ endgame content was considered sorely lacking compared to past games. It's also suffering from severe performance issues on PC specifically that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-takes-aim-at-performance-woes-but-opinions-vary-on-whether-it-worked"><u>have yet to be fully resolved</u></a>. Despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-heating-up-for-summer-with-its-next-season-event-heres-whats-new"><u>new content and seasons</u></a>, fans remain unsatisfied with the state of the game, to the point where some players are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-backlash-highlights-how-death-threats-against-devs-are-becoming-a-major-issue-in-japan"><u>taking things too far</u></a> and apparently harassing and threatening individual Capcom team members over it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Monster Hunter Wilds has a ‘mixed’ user review rating for all reviews, but a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating for recent reviews.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Unfortunately, it went through some major compromises and a big visual downgrade according to a comparison by <a href="https://youtu.be/0-10490qd8s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-10490qd8s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-10490qd8s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Digital Foundry notes that the Xbox Series X port of Black Myth: Wukong can run at a higher resolution (1296p) than PS5 (1080p), which gives it a slight advantage in clarity and detail as well as its ability to deliver 60fps. However, that comes at the expense of the lumen lighting system in performance mode. The intriguing and visually arresting lighting of the PC and PS5 versions are noticeably missing on Xbox Series X. There are also more frequent drops and full-screen tearing on Xbox Series X.</p><p>Xbox Series S has even bigger struggles running Black Myth: Wukong, and can only do so with downgraded visuals and the absence of the lumen lighting system. It was previously rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> were behind the delay of the game's port, which publisher Game Science denied. The Game Science team has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bringing the game to the Xbox consoles was unexpectedly difficult</a>.</p><p>Last month, Game Science announced that Black Myth: Wukong will receive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-black-myth-game-zhong-kui-announced-with-teaser-trailer/1100-6534105/" data-ref-id="1100-6534105">a sequel called Black Myth: Zhong Kui</a>. The development team added that the game is still very early in the process, but it has shared that players "won't be playing a monkey role this time." The studio is also "exploring and experimenting with the concrete differences between Wukong and Zhong Kui."</p>

<p>SEGA capped off the test period by sharing that a free demo will be heading our way at some point in mid-September, with "more info coming soon".</p>
<p>Details are still pretty slim, but the company could reveal that the demo will be an "offline single-player experience only", so don't expect to be speeding around the track with your pals again before launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rygsxq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>And that launch is really rather close. CrossWorlds is set to arrive on Switch 1 on <strong>25th September</strong>, with the Switch 2 version following at a later date in 2025. We have to assume that the demo will arrive at least a week before launch to give people adequate time to try before they buy, so keep an eye out for more details in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In case you missed it, CrossWorlds is already racking up an impressive roster of crossover racers, with even more to come. Across the game's DLC and future upgrades, the likes of SpongeBob SquarePants, Pac-Man, Persona 5's Joker and more will be joining Sonic and co. on the track — just don't expect them to be all that chatty...</p>

<p>Graham Greene lit up screens throughout a glittering 45-year career. The acclaimed actor did it all and has sadly passed away at the age of 73. Many gamers will fondly recognize and remember him for his incredible portrayal of Rains Fall in Rockstar Games’ Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>



<p>My first memory of Graham Greene was his role as Detective Joe Lambert in Die Hard with a Vengeance. He plays a valiant cop who ultimately tries his best to save kids he believes are in mortal danger. This is one of countless roles Graham accrued over his 40-plus-year career before his untimely passing on September 1.</p>



<p>Despite a resume anyone would snatch up in a heartbeat, Graham only had one video game role—Rains Fall in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-could-launch-on-switch-2-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-redemption-2-voice-actor-graham-greene-passes-away-aged-73">Red Dead Redemption 2 Voice Actor Graham Greene Passes Away Aged 73</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It will make future RDR2 playthroughs harder. Credit to YouTube channel: <br>I’ll Give You Insight</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you’ve played <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RDR2</a>, you know how important Rains Fall is to the story. He does his best to rein in his son—Eagle Flies—and advocates peace wherever possible.</p>



<p>Graham absolutely nails the role perfectly. It’s a wonder that this was his lone video game opportunity when you think about it. Technically, it wasn’t the only gaming project the actor was attached to.</p>



<p>In 2023, Graham played Marlon in HBO’s epic adaptation of Naughty Dog’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-receives-fewer-emmy-nominations-than-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> for one episode. He was also in 2008’s Turok: Son of Stone—but that reference is a bit more out there.</p>



<p>The actor graced TV shows, movies, and one of the greatest video games of all time, and it’s his role as Rains Fall that further cemented his legacy in the memories of millions of gamers.</p>



<p>Do you have a favorite Graham Greene role over the decades? Let me know, and also let us know if this is giving you the edge to go back and play Red Dead Redemption 2 for the tenth time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The horror shooter vibes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-spectrum">Project Spectrum</a> are absolutely on point as you trudge through dank, foggy, muddy woods on the approach to a decrepit manor. Strange anomalies float in midair in the courtyard, distorting and colouring the air around them, when something fast flashes across the rooftop. Yeah, probably time to set a shovel on fire, just in case.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Spectrum | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4cso5zprZk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world has been transformed by the appearance of Embers in a region that has subsequently been quarantined in what is known as the Ember Zone. Those who exist in this region can become transformed by Emberflux, altering their bodies and minds, but you have to gather a group of Agents and then send them in to try and neutralise the threat regardless. On the surface level, this game looks like a horror-infused extraction shooter, but Vice Game Director Rich Fu explains a different path that Project Spectrum is taking:</p>


<p>“We are different from the traditional extraction shooter, we are more like a CRPG [for progression]. One thing that we might think about is that, for instance, the characters or agents that you’re recruiting [and play as] in the game, if that character dies, they might just die! We wanted to be different from the traditional extraction shooter, like Tarkov, in terms of when you are searching for materials in the game and stuff like that.”</p>


<p>Project Spectrum is not a game that you’ll play alone, though, heading in as a squad, exploring this manor and trying to defeat the supernatural monsters you’ll find within. The atmosphere that Project Spectrum conjures up here is there with the very best, with creepy off-angle lighting such that you’ll need your flashlight or lighter, music randomly playing on a gramophone, and rooms where you can practically smell the musty rotting wood from the ruined decor. You might be playing together, but that doesn’t make it feel any less creepy, especially if you choose to split up.</p>
<p>The gameplay demo we saw took us to one of three points of interest in a wider world –&nbsp;alongside the manor, a fishery and a hospital were also options –&nbsp;but the full game will have a larger map to explore. Players will be turning up rather well equipped with modern guns, tactical gear and equipment to spot and track the anomalies –&nbsp;a camera that can highlight their location through walls and scenery –&nbsp;and there’s an emphasis to approaching quietly through the gameplay we’ve seen so far. This goes right down to trying to avoid crunching across broken glass, and hastily improvising a silencer with the crafting system, though I’m not sure what use a drinks can stuffed with cloth would actually be in reality. When it’s time to go loud, crafting molotov cocktails and the aforementioned fire shovel are also options.</p>

<p>And going loud can become a very quick necessity. I’ve buried the lede somewhat, as this isn’t even just a co-op horror game, but rather has PvPvE layered in as well. Other teams of players can be hunting the same anomaly, or looking to wait and attack you while you’re distracted or wounded, and this is another big reason for the cautious and quieter approach, as well as placing trip wires and other traps to prevent getting caught from behind while investigating.</p>
<p>Human combat will have a familiar tactical battle feel of many contemporary online shooters, but fighting the Emberborne monsters will rip you straight back to the horror shooter tone. As seen in the trailer, the towering, cloaked creature, seemingly made up of many masks can quickly shift around the environment, forcing you to spin and figure out where they are again, following the refracted light trails they leave while moving so quickly. Worse than that, as you deal damage, they can crumble down into basically a giant pile of masks with spider legs that splits and skitters around – a damage opportunity for your team, but also horrifying to the arachnophobic. Finally, we see the flaming spade set alight to swing at this enemy, which definitely does not like fire one bit.</p>

<p>All through this, your character’s sanity is being tested and drained, simply by existing in this tortured, twisted region. First by the depressing effect of trudging through the rainy woods to reach the manor, then by the dark and creepy environment, and then by facing the Emberborne themselves. Low sanity can lead to very obvious negatives, hallucinating shadowy enemies that can obscure and confound your view of the game.</p>
<p>But it’s not always bad, as Rich tells us, “Let’s talk about the disadvantages first. For the sanity level and its effect, there is a term in the game that we call Emberflux, and this means that human beings are being affected by the Ember. For the debuff, you can have a lot of illusions, but once you reach a certain level you might even see the perspective from other entities…. but I cannot tell you more than that for now!</p>
<p>“Then for the advantages, we have different characters with different abilities for how they are living with the sanity level, especially when it is low. For instance, some characters might get some new abilities, or their abilities might be stronger when the sanity level is low. And for another perspective, there’s the map exploration. You will only get to see some things when your sanity level is low, which could be a shortcut, certain rooms, certain areas, views or visuals which will help you to explore.</p>
<p>“But the key idea here for us is that we want to let the players choose whether they want to maintain a high level of sanity or low. They can take some risks to experience a different style of gameplay, or they can just make it safe.”</p>
<p>With the anomaly and an opposing team defeated, you’d think that’s job done, but there’s a further layer to this PvPvE game: the Executioner. This is another Ember-infused monster, a blob with smokey tendrils that it walks on in an alien fashion, but instead of being another Emberborne, this is another player that’s on the hunt. It’s an injection of the kinds of asynchronous multiplayer horror from the likes of Dead by Daylight, or perhaps more accurately Evolve.</p>

<p>Switching to the Executioner’s view, and their power is immediately clear to see with great traversal possibilities, climbing up to rooftops, blinking to new locations, and trying to use hit and run tactics. Of course, you can still be defeated, but it’s a fun twist to have yet another wildcard like this in the game. The curious element that’s yet to truly be revealed is how you become an Executioner. Is this a distinct character that you queue up to play as? Is it a sanity-driven transformation that you can aim to unlock mid-game? Surely you won’t have any allegiances to former teammates in that case…</p>
<p>This won’t be the only style of player monster that is in the game, though. Rich told us, “For the current Executioner, it’s only one of its forms. it also has other formats, and of course, we will have other Executioners added in the future, because we really consider this asymmetric gameplay a very important part of the game, so it has to be globally anticipated, so that is why we put a lot of effort on this.”</p>
<p>Project Spectrum is a fascinating blend of genres and ideas that has echoes of Tarkov, Hunt: Showdown and more, but by injecting sanity effects and abilities, giving players the chance to be the monster for asymmetrical battles, it’s creating something new and distinctive.</p>

            <p>It's been a little while since we got another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> tease that makes folks wonder whether CD Projekt are about to u-turn on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-update-23-is-delayed-and-definitely-not-just-because-cd-projekt-cant-stop-adding-things">adding more stuff to it</a> yet again. Here one is, though, and it invites us 2025 dwellers to help out a president who isn't elected in-universe until 2065.</p>
<p>Is it evidence that the NUSA have invented time travel tech that also allows Cyberpunk characters to migrate into our own reality? Is it just a way to spice up some promo for something like a livestream or minor reveal? I mean, almost definitely the latter, but the former's a lot more fun to consider.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, the tease. NUSA president Rosalind Myers, the one from Cyberpunk's Phantom Liberty expansion, needs "brave netrunners" to help her nation overcome a "mounting cybersecurity threat". The plea's dated September 4th, 2025, which is in the future, but not quite far enough into the future to match up with Myers' in-game presidential term. That kicks off in 2065, which is why she's still in power by the time V meets her in 2077.</p>
<p>What's president Roz doing teasing things dated about 40 years before she takes office, that're also happening in a different universe? Are Arasaka about to take over the official Witcher socials to post their own messages to us, inciting a seven hundredth corporate Twitter war? Are Kang Tao about to reveal they're behind the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekts-mysterious-project-hadar-is-now-their-research-focus-as-cyberpunk-2-and-witcher-4-gather-steam">mysterious Project Hadar</a>? As I say, probably not. If this is anything, the netrunner "recruitment test" aspect seems to hint at an ARG of some sort being in the offing.</p><div>

<p>Naturally, some fans have immediately gone off the deep end with extra expansion theories. If that's you, it's maybe worth bearing in mind that CD Projekt senior community manager Amelia Korzycka has responded to one user on the tweeter asking what the tease is with <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962521644041121965">the following message</a>: "All I can say is it's not the DLC and it's not the patch."
 </p>
<p>"'The' DLC? Instead of 'a' DLC?Y ou're gonna dive people crazy, you know that right? Me included," another user replied to Korzycka. "Is there an expansion DLC in the works?" The community manager, I assume after a deep sigh, has simply <a href="https://x.com/Lilayaah/status/1962759935608938808">responded to this query</a> with a "No."</p>
<p>Given that, I'd very much temper your expectations. It'd be foolish to totally rule out CD Projekt adding yet more stuff to Cyberpunk given the past few years, though. Here's hoping they at least explain Myers' ability to move through time and space.</p>
<p>Has it required her to fork over a bit of her brain space to Neo from The Matrix doing his best dickhead rock singer impression? Will Cyberpunk 2 be about stopping Roz and/or Idris Elba's Solomon Reed from going back in time to kill one of V's ancestors while dressed in leather and speaking like the most Austrian cyborg you've ever met? We need answers.</p>

<p>The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test was the game’s first proper hands-on opportunity. Don’t cry because it’s over, smile that it happened. Or if that doesn’t work, you can always enjoy the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo speeding your way.</p>



<p>This isn’t Sonic’s first foray into kart racers. Team Sonic Racing performed very well, and clearly well enough to warrant a full sequel. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is that very sequel, and it’s just had its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Network Test</a>. These types of tests are common and an easy way to ascertain a multiplayer title’s online connectivity and stability.</p>



<p>The beta has finished, meaning if you didn’t get a chance to log in, you’ve missed this window. But as one door closes, another opens.</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-demo-launches-in-september">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Demo Launches In September</h2>

<p>We’ve learned that Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is debuting a new single-player demo in “mid-September,” thanks to the Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X page</a>.</p>



<p>“The Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test has officially ended! Thank you everyone for participating! And in case you missed it… A single-player demo will be released in mid-September! We hope you keep coming back for more races!” said the page in a September 2 message.</p>



<p>September is a busy month in the gaming calendar. The likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC 26</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a> are some of the monstrous names propping up the month. If you can find time, a Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds demo will be wedged into the middle of this.</p>

<p>I didn’t get a chance to try the Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Open Network Test. It seemed to be fun, so let me know if you played it through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. Can it handle the gargantuan task of beating Mario Kart World?</p>
