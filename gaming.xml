            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/full-zombie-list-in-7-days-to-die/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a world full of zombies, seeing one stumbling toward you doesn’t always elicit fear. But in 7 Days to Die, it should. You never know what type of zombie is coming your way until they’re too close for comfort. But knowing your enemy is half the battle. Here is the full 7 Days to Die zombie list!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-zombie-type-in-7-days-to-die">Every Zombie Type in 7 Days to Die</h2>



<p>First and foremost, there are four zombie types in 7 Days to Die: Normal, Strong, Special, and Animal. Every zombie in the game falls into one of these categories. They all also follow the same behavior patterns, becoming more vicious and powerful during the night.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Normal Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Festering Corpse</li>



<li>Departed Woman</li>



<li>Infected Survivor</li>



<li>Infected Mother</li>



<li>Motivated Cheerleader</li>



<li>Plague Nurse</li>



<li>Putrid Girl</li>



<li>Rotting Carcass</li>



<li>Reanimated Corpse</li>



<li>Risen Woman</li>



<li>Skater Punk</li>



<li>Walker Male</li>



<li>Zombie Cowboy</li>



<li>Zombie Farmer</li>



<li>Zombie Janitor</li>



<li>Party Girl</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Strong Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bloated Walker</li>



<li>Fat Hawaiian</li>



<li>Fallen Soldier</li>



<li>Frozen Lumberjack</li>



<li>Hazmat Male</li>



<li>Hungry Female</li>



<li>Utility Worker</li>



<li>Zombie Biker</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Special Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Burn Victim</li>



<li>Crawler</li>



<li>Demolisher</li>



<li>Feral Wight</li>



<li>Screamer</li>



<li>Spider Zombie</li>



<li>Infected Police Officer</li>



<li>Team Z Football Zombie</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Animal Zombies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Zombie Bear</li>



<li>Zombie Dog</li>



<li>Zombie Vulture</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>







<p>Blood Moon Horde Zombies</p>



<p>Alongside the four typical types of zombies in 7 Days to Die, a few of them also spawn as part of the Blood Moon Horde. They’re more powerful, more relentless, and downright annoying if you’re a new player trying to eke out a living in the zombie apocalypse. </p>



<p>Currently, the Blood Moon Horde special zombies consist of:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Demolisher</strong></li>



<li><strong>Feral Wight</strong></li>



<li><strong>Infected Police Officer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombie Vulture</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, Blood Moon Horde also contains various Normal Zombies to help flesh out the ranks, so prepare yourself for a fight!</p>

		<p>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 will be available on Steam from August 15th, Stardock Games has announced. The game was originally an Epic Games Store exclusive, having released in October 2022. The Steam base version will be priced at $39.99 and the Premium Edition will be $79.99. The Premium edition of Sins of a Solar Empire 2 includes the base game, first Content Pass (4 DLC: 1 small, 1 medium, and 2 expansion level) and the Sins of a Solar Empire II soundtrack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sins of a Solar Empire II | Steam Release Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4sbOAP-wKfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“It’s been amazing to see how hyped fans are for the release of&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;on Steam,”</em> said Brian Clair, Director of Publishing at Stardock Entertainment. “<em>We have seen so many people who were fans of the original Sins, and&nbsp;Sins: Rebellion, sharing their excitement for this long-awaited sequel.&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;will deliver epic galactic warfare and strategy to new players on Steam, and our existing players on Epic Games Store, as they will be continually supported with new content and updates. We can’t wait to share more with you and celebrate the launch of&nbsp;Sins of a Solar Empire II&nbsp;on August 15!”</em></p>
<p>Sins of a Solar Empire 2 contains three playable races which are Advent, Vasari, and TEC. Planets also follow their orbital paths which makes the maps dynamic and makes players have to change tactics on the fly. There are also minor factions dotted around that can be influenced and become allies. Capital ships can have a lot of augmentations to change the tide of battle, and within battles lasers and rockets can be deflected by shields. There is also a mod browser that allows players to easily install various mods.</p>

		<p>We’re getting over the hump of the Olympics this weekend, and Team GB has been doing a generally fantastic job of picking medals through the first half. Oh sure, a few of those came from the horsey stuff (it’s still super strange that horse dancing is an event, right?), but we’ve also done pretty darn well in and on the water, with early biking events, triathlon, and more!</p>
<p>There’s always this kind of scepticism in the run up to the Olympics – invariably from the locals who fear being subjected to local travel and life disruption – but it’s followed by a swell of pride and joy as everyone gets to see their nation’s representatives compete, and this year is no different.</p>
<p>Anyway, on to the video games stuff.</p>

Good luck to everyone involved. Your work will be missed.”</p><p>“Thank you for what you have brought to the video game industry,” said <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1819450792916799578">the official Konami account on X</a>. “We will never stop fondly reminiscing about waiting for that next issue to arrive in the mail.

<p>Earlier today, Jordan ‘JKap’ Kaplan revealed that he’s departing the CDL’s LA Thieves after almost four years with the brand as a coach. During his time with the 100 Thieves-backed brand, JKap secured two chips and a ring, winning the 2022 CDL Championship with a phenomenal victory over FaZe Clan during the Vanguard season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pastures-new">Pastures New</h2>



<p>JKap, who is one of the winningest players in Call of Duty history, is relocating to the East Coast, per the video update he posted recently on social media:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>He stressed that this was a mutual split and that he’s parting ways with the LA Thieves on amicable terms. In his video, JKap explained that he wanted to find a way to work remotely with the team, but 100 Thieves insisted that they wanted on-site employees. </p>



<p>In his video, Kaplan explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have a set plan for what I’m doing – I’m still open to opportunities. I’mn just kind of taking a leap and forcing myself to make this change, as scary as it is, because Call of Duty has been all I’ve known. I was a pro player for about ten years, I’ve been a coach for the last four, and quite literally, Call of Duty has been my whole life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a dangerous twist to his farewell speech, he mentioned that he’ll now have more freedom over his opinions, and his ‘hot takes’ will start to bleed out as he voices his concerns about the Call of Duty esports scene. With that being said, it’ll be worth keeping an eye on JKap’s socials moving forward for some juicy COD-based tidbits.</p>

		<p>The shooter-MOBA hybrid that is Predecessor is moving from open beta to a full release on August 20th, Omeda Studios has confirmed. The idea for Predecessor game from the fall of Epic Games’ own MOBA, Paragon, building upon the ideas that were present in that game. Predecessor moved into open beta in March this year, with over a million people playing it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Opening Night Live Teaser | Gamescom | Predecessor" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jyuOuXhPECc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>During the open beta phase, Omeda Studios added Ranked mode, Brawl mode, and the two new heroes Terra and Aurora. There have also been balance fixes along with new skins added too. Predecessor has 35 playable characters each with their own abilities and skills. The game has also been developed in Unreal Engine 5, and supports cross-platform play. Skins can be purchased in the game using in game currency too. The key details are below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Truly Unique Gameplay – With the core of a MOBA but the mechanics of a third-person shooter/brawler, Predecessor offers a visceral experience that other MOBAs lack, while rewarding teamwork and strategy in a way many shooters overlook.</em></li>
<li><em>Over 35 playable characters – Predecessor’s deep character roster contains over 30 unique Heroes with distinct play styles and abilities.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>The Only Unreal Engine 5 MOBA – Created in Unreal Engine 5, Predecessor is the only MOBA to be developed in Unreal’s latest engine. This new state-of-the-art game engine produces high-resolution and high-fidelity graphics for current and previous gen consoles.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Play with Friends, No Matter Where They Are – Predecessor was developed with both console and PC gamers in mind with cross-play functionality so friends can play together regardless of their platform.</em></li>
<li><em>Earnable In-Game Content – Predecessor features a ton of rewards, including custom skins, for players to earn or purchase with in-game currency.&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-4-was-in-development-and-in-partially-playable-state-before-larian-scrapped-the-project.943851/</guid>

			<p>Larian Studios made it clear a few months back that their next game wouldn't be set in the Forgotten Realms, but the developer had started working on Baldur's Gate 4 before scrapping the project for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/i-call-it-chaos-at-scale-for-the-first-anniversary-of-baldurs-gate-3-we-spoke-exclusively-to-swen-vincke-about-the-past-present-and-future-of-larian-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC Gamer</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke revealed that the studio was originally open to the idea of more Baldur's Gate, as they were in a vulnerable state following the release of the third entry in the series. <em>"So if something is super successful, obviously everyone's [asking] you, 'When are you going to make the next one?"</em>, Vincke said. <em>"And when you, as a developer, come out of this little miserable cave that you've been sitting in for many, many hours as you're finishing your thing, you're vulnerable."</em></p>
<p>In the beginning, Larian didn't go on working on Baldur's Gate 4 but rather on an expansion of the third entry in the series because it was considered to be the easiest route to take, as they had the engine and everything else already for the creation of more content. Progress was quick due to the production machine still being warm, but eventually, the project was retooled as a new game, as Vincke and his team didn't feel like working on this expansion for three years was worth it. The same, however, happened when the project became Baldur's Gate 4, and when the idea of scrapping the project was brought to the developers, the consensus was to move on. Sadly, it sounds like we are really missing out, as Baldur's Gate 4 was in a partially playable state, and players would have really loved it, according to Vincke.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games ever released by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian Entertainment’s action RPG Avowed will no longer be released in 2024, Microsoft has confirmed. Instead, the game has been pushed back to February 18th, 2025. The short reason given for the new release date is primarily due to the number of big games coming out in the second half of 2024. Instead, Microsoft has seemingly targeted a date which will be relatively quiet, allowing Avowed to get more attention.</p>
<p><iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYvTNAaXMUA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Avowed takes us back to the Living Lands, a mysterious islands in the fantasy world of Eora, which it shares with Obsidian’s previous&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">Pillars of Eternity</a> games. However, where those games were both top-down CRPGs and part of the genre’s revival over the past decade, Avowed will shift back to one of Obsidian’s areas of expertise: first person action RPG adventuring. Avowed is not a fully open world game, but has several large open areas that you can explore. In that regard it might be comparable to one of Obsidian’s other acclaimed hits,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/22/the-outer-worlds-review/">The Outer Worlds</a>. In the game, you’ll encounter NPCs who can join your party and accompany you on your quest, with the option to have two companions at your side. As an envoy of the Aedyr Empire, players are tasked with investigating a spiritual plague that endangers the world. Throughout the player journey, there will be opportunities to wield the power to either save or doom the world, utilising a combination of magical abilities, melee combat, and firearms.</p>
<p>When Avowed releases, it will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems out of nowhere THQ Nordic and Gunfire Games have confirmed that a Darksiders game is in development, but outside of a teaser we do not know whether this is Darksiders 4, another spin off, a prequel, or a remake. You can see the teaser below, which gives very little away but it is sure to excite Darksiders fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHuefHUAX3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The only clue given is the tagline, which is “Be Prepared to Ride Again.” That could point to either a sequel to the original Darksiders, carrying on from the final scene which saw the other Horsemen coming to join War. It also could allude to a remake of the first game, which did already get a remastered version when it was re-released as Darksiders Warmastered Edition back in 2016. It could be another game entirely, starring one of the other Horsemen. Darksiders II had Death as the main character, Darksiders III had Fury, and Darksiders Genesis saw War and Strife as the playable characters. Ideally, this will be Darksiders 4 which will see the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse working together.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> At the very end of the trailer you can see the words “Originally developed by Vigil Games” which does suggest this is yet another remake or remaster of Darksiders 1 or 2, or both.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">Darksiders Genesis Review&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>Darksiders Genesis was the last Darksiders game to release, launching in 2019. In our review, Dom said, <em>“Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</em></p>

<p>That third lacklustre entry, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/26/darksiders-iii-review/">Darksiders III</a>, got a 7/10 in our review. Thomas said,<em> “Darksiders III, while more limited in scope than its predecessor, provides a tighter, more deliberate experience that elaborates on the lore we’ve seen so far. The smaller world of Darksiders 3 may disappoint some fans of the previous game, but this feels like a reboot of the series. Poor PC performance, a lack of side-objectives and some unimaginative world-design point to a game with ambitions bigger than its budget, but Darksiders III is a fun and challenging experience that kept me engaged across the length of its story.”</em></p>

			<p>A couple of days ago, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-might-be-getting-delayed-to-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> hearing that Avowed would suffer a small delay to give it more breathing room from an otherwise busy Fall game release schedule. A few hours ago, Xbox <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1819495487155982486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the news, revealing that the game is now set to launch on February 18, 2025. New gameplay for Avowed will be shown in a live stream scheduled for August 23.</p>
<p>They also reminded players there are lots of games made by Microsoft-owned studios on the way. World of Warcraft: The War Within, the tenth expansion for Blizzard's premiere MMO, launches on August 26 (and you can read all about getting ready for it here). Age of Mythology: Retold, the remastered version of the classic RTS game, is due September 4. The turn-based grand strategy game Ara: History Untold from Oxide Games (Ashes of the Singularity) is out on September 24.</p>
<p>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred, the first expansion for the popular hack-and-slash action RPG, launches October 8. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is out on October 25. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, an updated version of the already amazing flight simulation game, will be released on November 19.</p>
<p>Three more Xbox first-party games are due in 2024 without a fixed launch date: Stoic's side-scrolling multiplayer action-adventure game Towerborne, the Shattered Space Starfield expansion, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Moreover, Microsoft has a three-month exclusivity deal with GSC Game World for STALKER 2, which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-delayed-november-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> from early September to November 20.</p>
<p>As for Avowed, Obsidian Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-to-feature-third-person-camera-and-respec-option-game-director-says-its-looking-fantastic-and-ready-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed</a> very confident about hitting the 2024 launch, so it must have been a Microsoft directive. The studio's website even briefly listed a November 12 release date before getting amended.&nbsp;The developers certainly won't be able to add new content to the RPG, which will be on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-confirmed-by-obsidian-to-be-very-short-for-an-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short </a>side of the spectrum for the genre, in just three months.</p>
<p>However, that's plenty of time to fix bugs and improve performance, which could help deliver the most polished Obsidian game to date. RPG fans still have Dragon Age: The Veilguard to look forward to this Fall, with BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-reveal-its-release-date-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> to announce the date later this month.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avowed-delay-pushes-back-release-to-february-2025.943800/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-confirmed-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has just been confirmed that Avowed <strong>is </strong>being delayed into 2025 and that the Obsidian title will now be released on February 18. This news comes following rumours that surfaced in recent days talking about the game’s untimely delay. In a post on social media, the Xbox team confirmed that Avowed has been delayed to avoid clashing with ‘so many games’ coming out later this year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-three-more-months">Three More Months</h2>



<p>Avowed was due to drop in November, but with an immense gaming schedule being built up for H2 2024, there’s <strong>a lot </strong>of competition on the horizon. Therefore, like many others before them, Obsidian and the Xbox team have made the strategic decision to release Avowed when the gaming schedule is a little less cluttered.</p>



<p>This means that Avowed will no longer need to compete with the likes of Black Ops 6, Indiana Jones, Starfield’s Shattered Space DLC, the new World of Warcraft expansion, or any number of the games yet to be released this year.</p>



<p>That’s what was alluded to by Xbox in a post on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So many games coming! As such, we’re moving Avowed to Feb 18, 2025 to give players’ backlogs some breathing room.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The three-month delay isn’t so much to tussle with – and from what we’ve seen, Avowed is more or less ready to go. It could be that this delay is a veiled attempt to get more breathing space and development time in, but that’s not exactly a bad thing.</p>

<p>With esports becoming increasingly popular each day, specific countries seem to have different games reign in popularity. So, what are the top esports games in the USA? With North America having some of the best teams in competitive gaming, there are surely quite a few games that hit a massive popularity mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-esports-games-in-the-usa">Top Esports Games In The USA</h2>



<p>Esports continues to stride towards new heights. The industry consistently sees new monthly tournaments, with the Olympics even adding gaming to its repertoire.</p>



<p>Which esports games would be considered the most popular in the USA?</p>



<figure></figure>







<h4 id="h-biggest-esports-in-the-usa">Biggest Esports In The USA:</h4>



<ul>
<li>1. Fortnite </li>



<li>2. Dota 2</li>



<li>3. Counter-Strike</li>



<li>4. Rocket League</li>



<li>5. Apex Legends</li>
</ul>



<p>While the five games listed above are quite popular in the US, Fortnite sits in first place with over $48 million in prize money awarded to American competitors.</p>



<p>Dota 2, the second-biggest esports game in the USA, has awarded $18 million in prize money to American players, which is well below Fortnite.</p>







<h3 id="h-top-esports-tournaments-in-the-usa">Top Esports Tournaments In The USA</h3>



<p>With the USA giving out some serious prize money across different esports titles, a few tournaments have remained the best when it comes to popularity and prize pools.</p>



<h4 id="h-biggest-esports-tournaments-in-the-usa">Biggest Esports Tournaments In The USA:</h4>



<ul>
<li>1. Fortnite World Cup</li>



<li>2. Dota 2: The International 2015</li>



<li>3. Call of Duty League Championship 2020</li>



<li>4. Call of Duty League Championship 2022</li>



<li>5. Dota 2: The International 2016</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<p>While the majority of these tournaments have nowhere the size of prize pools that they used to, we still see quite a bit of esports action from each of these games in the USA.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Is Fallout London Worth Your Time?</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The game itself starts like most Fallout games: You make a character and eventually leave an underground base. Once you reach the surface, you take a train that shows you what's left of London.</p><p dir="ltr">As the name suggests, the mod takes place in London, the first time players have been outside the United States. Even though it's a fan-made mod, it has the look and feel that most players have come to expect from the series. What's nice about the mod is that it even has futuristic double-decker buses, red phone booths, and even real-world historical landmarks.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio made some changes to make Fallout London stand out from the original. For example, Bottle Caps are not the primary currency used. Instead, the game uses Tube Tickets. Fallout London's early-game is more linear, but the city is dense overall. It sacrifices extensive open areas and replaces them with smaller landscapes that can often feel like mazes, and finding locations requires some legwork that may turn away some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out the video to hear our thoughts on the popular mod<span> and decide if you want to give it a go yourself. Of course, if London isn't calling you, we have a long list of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/"> best Fallout mods</a> to</span> consider.</p>

                <p>Fanatical's build-your-own-bundles often bring some great games and hidden gems to light, and this month's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fplatinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-up-to-18-games-for-less-than-3-each-with-fanaticals-august-platinum-bundle%2F1100-6525513%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platinum Collection</a> is the perfect example. The lineup includes four games that have never been in a Fanatical bundle before, and seven games that have never been in bundles before <em>period</em>. Like other Build Your Own deals from Fanatical, the Platinum Collection lets you select from a pool of PC games to create your own bundle, and the savings get better as you add more games. The bundle starts at three games for $3.33 each ($10 total). Add five games and you'll pay $3 each, and if you select seven or more games for your Platinum collection, you pay just $2.86 each. If you grab all 18 titles, you'll only pay $51.41 for the lot.</p><p>There are a few standouts among Fanatical's picks for this bundle, with the most notable being <strong>DMC: Devil May Cry</strong>. The retelling of the original Devil May Cry updates the PlayStation 2 original with a contemporary setting and cleaned-up combat, while still retaining what's great about the franchise: ridiculous, over-the-top demon-slaying action.</p><p>You can also snag <strong>Trover Saves the Universe</strong>, a goofy title from Squanch Games with humor akin to the likes of Rick and Morty so. And speaking of games inspired by TV, there's the <strong>Cobra Kai Collection</strong>, which packs two side-scrolling brawlers that draw from the Netflix series that updates the Karate Kid franchise (and is excellent, by the way).</p><p>A secret diamond in the rough, though, might be <strong>Remember Me</strong>. The 2013 action game was developed by Life is Strange studio Dontnod Entertainment. While some of its ideas are a bit half-baked--it relies a lot on combat that's very similar to the Batman Arkham games, with environmental traversal that's very similar to Uncharted--it's set in a beautiful and fascinating sci-fi dystopia and has some very cool mechanics that relate to scrubbing through other people's memories. It's underrated if for no other reason than its glitchy and synthy orchestral soundtrack.</p><p>Those are just a few of the 18 games on offer in the August 2024 edition of Fanatical's Build Your Own Platinum Collection bundle. There's there's also 2D brawler <strong>River City Girls Zero</strong>, open space exploration sim <strong>Everspace Ultimate Edition</strong>, dungeon-crawling action RPG <strong>Sands of Aura</strong>, plenty more.

            <p>
Salt and Sanctuary, from Ska Studios, is a bit bloody good, serving up an enormously enjoyable, Dark Souls-inspired slice of 2D action-adventure. It's also now eight years old - but that hasn't stopped it from getting a surprise update this week, adding a tough new Randomiser mode.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary, which initially released for PlayStation 4 and PC back in 2016, is a fairly explicit attempt to translate From Software's now oft-replicated dark fantasy RPG formula, complete with considered combat and corpse runs, into two dimensions. It begins on the shores of a vast and broodily enigmatic kingdom, which players - in the role of the Saltborn - must explore and overcome, tackling enemies and imposing bosses along the way.
</p>
<p>
It's good stuff, and not exactly a walk in the park, but it just got a whole lot tougher thanks to its new Randomiser mode. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/283640/view/4344369662294623052?l=english">detailed over on Steam</a>, Salt and Sanctuary players looking to give themselves a real challenge can now select from three randomiser options: Item Randomiser, Monster Randomiser, and Scaling Monster Randomiser.

<p>
The first randomises all non-essential items around the world, while Monster Randomiser mixes up enemies and bosses without giving them stat changes. As for the Scaling Monster Randomiser, it also switches up enemy and boss positions, but this time <em>does</em> give them adjusted stats. Currently, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/">Salt and Sanctuary subreddit</a> (which remains surprisingly active for a ten-year-old game) is having a grand old time documenting Randomiser mode's cruelty.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary's latest update - which is out now for PC players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283640/Salt_and_Sanctuary/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/salt-and-sanctuary">Epic Games Store</a> - also includes miscellaneous bug fixes, a Turkish localisation, plus support for 4K/UHD, with new higher resolution options now available.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary received a sequel, Salt and Sacrifice, in 2022, but some changes to the formula - discrete zones linked by a hub replacing the first game's interconnected map, for instance, and new Monster Hunter style boss encounters - didn't seem to resonate quite so much with fans of the original. Still, the first game remains a treat ("shockingly good" is what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/salt-and-sanctuary-review">Eurogamer said</a> about it), so an excuse to return thanks to its latest update is a welcome one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parsons-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Right now, my social media feeds are full of people mourning layoffs, both on the journalism side, with the sudden closure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a> today, and on the developer side, with Wednesday's <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at Bungie</a>. But, uh, at least some CEOs are doing okay? On this week's episode of Aftermath Hours, we're real pissed about that. </p><p>Luke, Chris, and I start by discussing the Bungie layoffs, which saw 220 people lose their jobs and other people and teams shuffled around into parent company Sony. According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=147249643&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=18lby&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, Bungie had "repeatedly missed financial targets promised to Sony and had been losing money since the release of February 2023’s <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion <em>Lightfall</em>."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schreier reported </a>today, many of those affected by the layoffs put the blame on CEO Pete Parsons, "saying he had failed to take accountability for his own bad bets and that he’d been overly optimistic in his communication with the staff." But one thing Parsons didn't fail to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend over 2 million dollars on classic cars</a>, apparently winning over a dozen cars on an auction site. We all know CEOs are ghouls, but now one example of their ghoulishness is on display for all to see. </p><p>Next, we talk about how, instead of getting a new <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> Olympics game, we got <a href="https://aftermath.site/olympics-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crummy mobile game</a> with an NFT attached. This leads us to reflect on the Olympics games of our youths, and also how bad the battery life on the Game Gear was. </p><p>Then, we move away from bad news to rave about games we're enjoying: Luke, with excellent city-builder <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/cataclismo-impressions-rts-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cataclismo</a></em>, and me, with excellent comedy platformer <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a></em>. </p><p>Last, we answer some reader questions, discussing what game genre we’d like to resurrect, how both we and our pets would do in the Olympics, fake cubes, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q1hoEhfk4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible new AI device we can’t believe is real</a>, and what the <em>Rashomon</em> of games would be.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy some fancy cars, and then sit outside shitty CEOs' houses revving the engines really loud.</p><p>Here's an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It was like two million on classic cars and motorbikes since [Sony] bought the studio in 2022. And that exists everywhere, you know what I mean: talk about wealth, I mean Gabe [Newell of Valve]. But Gabe's not doing that stuff, or he's better at hiding it.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I wrote a blog just before I left Kotaku about <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-gabe-newell-submarine-submersible-valve-science-1850563956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabe's submarine</a>. He spent god knows how much money on his very functional billionaire submarine which is excellent and does genuine scientific work. But that ain't cheap! Pete Parsons does not have Gabe money, Gabe's on a different level.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That's James Cameron money, that's that good money. That's "you own a marketplace" money. </p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The money's going straight to you; it's not getting diluted among shareholders. </p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Parsons buying cars] just seems tacky. Also just generally, where does the money go and who does it go to?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> In this case, like I said, all these people spend their money on weird things--they're rich! [Parsons] was a rare example where we got to see it, like we got to actually see what this dude spends his money on. It was like, "aw, man." I like cars! I would probably have multiple cars if I was that rich.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That's a fun question. What's the weirdo thing I would spend my money on if I was a billionaire executive?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> How about I'm gonna come up with a really left field suggestion: I'd keep my staff employed. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there was something wrong with an old game, or you wanted to make a different version of it, and you wanted people to help you fix that, you typically did that on RomHacking.net. After this week, you'll have to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, the site has been home to some remarkable remakes, translations, fix-ups, and experiments. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/so-long-slowdown-new-hack-runs-snes-star-fox-at-up-to-60-fps/"><em>Star Fox&nbsp;</em>running at 60 fps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/a-christmas-gift-from-game-boy-rom-hackers-super-mario-land-2-in-color/"><em>Super Mario Land 2</em> in color</a>, a fix for <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s bad smoke, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-traced-namcos-new-pac-man-demake-to-its-source-a-2008-fan-romhack/">a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em> "demake" that Namco spiffed up and resold</a>—and that's not even counting the stuff that was pulled down by corporate cease-and-desist actions. It's a remarkable collection, one that encompasses both very obscure and mainstream games and well worth preserving.</p>
<p>Preserved it will be, but it seems that the RomHacking site will not go on further. The site's founder <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405">posted a sign-off statement to the site Thursday night</a>, one that in turn praised the community, decried certain members of it, and looked forward to what will happen with "the next generation."</p>
<p>To condense the statement by founder Nightcrawler: the site had come a long way, he missed the early small-group days, there are more options now, and then, last year, he attempted to hand control over to a small internal group. That is when, Nightcrawler writes, he "discovered a most dishonest and hate filled group," one that targeted him for cutting out of the site and harassment.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The site's database, minus accounts and profiles, has been <a href="https://archive.org/details/romhacking.net-20240801">handed off to the Internet Archive</a>. RomHacking will have news posts and forums, but everything else is read-only, and the official Twitter and Discord "affiliations" are ended.</p>
<p>"I thank all of the many staff and community members whom kept the wheels turning and the lights on over the years. I am proud of our many accomplishments here together. I will carry forward remembering the good times, laughing about the bad times, and knowing she was right for the time, but time has a way of moving on," Nightcrawler wrote.</p>
<h2>Not the whole story</h2>
<p>Gideon Zhi, proprietor of Time Capsule Games and member of RomHacking for more than 20 years, took issue with Nightcrawler's monologued coda. <a href="https://x.com/GideonZhi/status/1819215914988196204">In a thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Zhi acknowledged the site's technical debt, monetary cost, and the burnout in being its administrator. "But he existed as a single point of failure for the site and exerted iron-fisted control over community-created content, and categorically refused basically all offers of help over the last decade," Zhi wrote.</p>
<p>Zhi details a near abandonment of the site last year, followed by attempts by interested members, gathered on the site's Discord chat server, to transition the site's back-end to modern storage and file serving, such as Amazon Web Services S3, and last-minute refusal by Nightcrawler to enact the changes. He also denied that the volunteers on the attempted transition threatened or doxxed Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>An administrator on the now "unofficial" Discord for the site confirmed a "rocky" relationship between the founder and the would-be administrators, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/founder-takes-down-the-nexus-mods-of-romhacking-after-20-years-because-lines-were-crossed-by-a-most-dishonest-and-hate-filled-group-but-others-tell-a-different-story/">reported by PC Gamer</a>. The Discord admin also denied threats or harassment toward Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>While ROM hacking, translation, demakes, and other game-altering work will certainly continue elsewhere, the gaming world has lost a kind of central depot for the most notable fixes, one with a community full of very experienced hackers.</p>

                <p>Despite releasing one of the year's most critically acclaimed expansions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-the-final-shape-introduces-flying-dread-enemies/1100-6522513/" data-ref-id="1100-6522513">Destiny 2's The Final Shape</a>, it's been a rough year for Bungie. Last October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/" data-ref-id="1100-6518871">the developer laid off roughly 100 people</a>, equating to approximately 8% of it's workforce. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">the studio let go another 220</a>--a shockingly high 17% of its workforce--while also relocating 12% of its remaining staff to its parent company, Sony.</p><p>Bungie executive Pete Parsons cited "rising costs of development," "industry shifts," and "enduring economic conditions" as the reason for the mass layoffs, which impacted "most" of Bungie's executive and senior leader positions. Considering this loss of leadership, it comes as no surprise then that the studio is entering what the executive refers to as a time of "tremendous change." And as for the mass transfer of former Bungie employees to Sony, Parsons' explained the move aims to "deepen" Bungie's integration with the company--a statement that has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpP6wO98eqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UpP6wO98eqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though it's easy to see these layoffs as merely the latest in a series' of widespread job losses in the industry, it also showcases the trend of large corporations acquiring well-known developers and how it ultimately leads to significant changes in staffing, priorities, and, potentially, identity. This week on Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss the impact of these layoffs and what it means for the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-as-employees-fear-more-layoffs-report/1100-6521967/" data-ref-id="1100-6521967">Marathon</a>, and Bungie as a whole.</p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>
