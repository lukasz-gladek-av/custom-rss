            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> has reportedly earned Blizzard around $150 million from in-game microtransactions since it released in June 2023.</p>
<p>That's according to senior product manager, Harrison Froeschke, who stated in a since-nuked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-froeschke/">LinkedIn account</a> that they had led the "monetisation strategy of the store cosmetics, pricing, bundle offers, personalised discounts, and roadmap planning which have driven over $150m [microtransaction] lifetime revenue".</p>

<p>Froeschke's LinkedIn account has now been removed from public view, but not before <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/blizzard-reveals-how-much-money-players-spent-on-microtransaction/z1726b">Game Pressure</a> managed to snap a screenshot purportedly taken from Froeschke's account, which also alleges the product manager has overseen game sales "resulting in over $1bn total lifetime revenue".</p>
<p>The numbers help us contextualise not only Diablo 4's success - Blizzard itself confirmed Diablo 4 had generated <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230612864402/en/Diablo%C2%AE-IV-Crosses-666-Mi%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dn-Five-Days-of-Launch-Setting-New-Blizzard-All-Time-Record">$666m in just five days</a> - but also the commercial impact of making the game available for no additional cost to Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>
<p>Back in July, of course, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes to Xbox Game Pass</a> that would see day-one releases being removed as a benefit to subscribers of the service's revised basic tier, including Diablo 4.</p>
<p>That new tier - known as Game Pass Standard - is now live, but it turns out subscribers are missing out on more than just new releases: Microsoft has pulled access to over 40 previously available games, including major titles like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Hellblade 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-water-the-forever-winter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following a recent beta, in which a few content creators and players from the game’s Discord were able to test out a recent build of the game, a new mechanic came to light: Water. In the game, water proves vital. It’s a crucial resource you must collect in the wasteland to attract merchants and mercenaries to your base. But there’s cause for concern. Your water depletes. When it does, say goodbye to your progress. Here’s what you should know about water in The Forever Winter!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-water-work-in-the-forever-winter">How Does Water Work in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, alongside the loot you’ll find in the world to earn money, <strong>you’ll collect water from the wasteland to help sustain your home. As you bring back water, it collects in a reservoir, attracting merchants and mercenaries.</strong> The former will sell you better equipment, like rigs and weapons. If you choose to play the game solo, the latter will journey into the raid with you, fighting by your side as an AI companion. </p>



<p>But there’s a catch, unfortunately. <strong>Your water depletes over time</strong>. It’s not a problem if you’re actively playing the game, but it also depletes in<strong> real time </strong>when you’re not playing. If you take a break from The Forever Winter to check out another game, you’ll return to find your water completely gone. If your water is gone, then the merchants and mercenaries leave.</p>



<p>But even worse is, <strong>if your water depletes completely, you’ll lose your entire stash</strong>. All of the equipment and items you’ve looted are gone!</p>



<p>According to developer Fun Dog Studios, the goal is for players to “<strong>feel anxiety</strong>,” even when not playing the game.</p>



<p>With all that said, the mechanic is supposedly quite forgiving time-wise. <strong>Your reservoir is said to hold a month’s worth of water</strong>, which you can fill in a few raids. If you hop in on the weekends to play, you should be okay.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-devs-change-how-water-works">Will the Devs Change How Water Works?</h2>



<p>As of right now, no, they won’t. When criticized for the mechanic by playtesters and fans in the Discord, they doubled down and confirmed that they might change how much water you loot in-raid, but they won’t change the overall mechanic. It’s a core game component; they want you to play frequently or lose everything. </p>



<p>What do you think of the water mechanic in The Forever Winter? Is it too much, or is the one-month reservoir enough? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official forums</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s almost time to hop in-game. Here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-can-you-play-the-forever-winter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when you can play The Forever Winter</a> on PC!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24243908/shogun-showdown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shogun Showdown</em> sometimes breaks my brain. The new deckbuilding roguelike is all about tactics, and a key part of the game is that you can always see what the enemies plan to do next. Every once in a while, that gets me in a quandary where I know I’ll lose. But when things click into place and I clear everyone out in one fell swoop, I feel like a strategic genius.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the game, which <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2084000%2FShogun_Showdown%2F">just left early access</a>, you’re constantly trying to position your character across a small level to either attack your foes or dodge their moves. As you play, you can upgrade your “tiles” (think: cards) to improve their damage, add perks like freezing ice, or lower their cooldown so that you can use them more frequently. You’re also able to stack up to three tiles so that, with one press of the attack button, you send off a salvo of moves to take out a bunch of bad guys at once.</p><div><figcaption><em>Since you can see everyone’s moves, there’s usually a lot of options to mull through.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>Since you can see what the enemies will do, you’re constantly strategizing about whether to move in to strike or if you need to back off to stay alive. It can get complex, and sometimes it feels like I have to galaxy brain each move to survive difficult rounds. The strategizing is all worth it when you pull off a series of attacks that clear the battlefield.</p><p>Here’s an example of how it comes together. Playing as the starter character, called the Wanderer, I start with a pair of swords that can simultaneously hit the spaces to my left and right as well as an arrow that can fire across the level. With some strategic maneuvering, I can set up the Wanderer so that she strikes a baddie that’s behind her and then shoots an arrow in front of her to eliminate all the dangers on the map.</p><p>During each run, you’ll have opportunities to improve your tiles, pick up new ones, and shop for upgrades. Sure, those are all familiar roguelike trappings, but with a little planning, you can make some extraordinarily powerful tiles. For my first winning run, I upgraded an arrow tile so it had high damage and no cooldown, meaning I was firing off arrows without breaking a sweat.</p><div><figcaption><em>Upgrades galore!</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Goblinz Publishing</cite></p></div><p>As you play, you’ll also collect skulls that can be used to unlock things like new tiles and more things to buy at item shops. Spending those skulls quickly adds variety to each run, and I don’t think I’ve doubled up on a build yet. Once, I went all in on a dragon punch move that sent enemies flying into each other, and while it didn’t get me a win, I loved punching bad guys across levels to open up space.</p><p>I’m still early in the game, and I’ve only unlocked one of four additional characters, so there’s still a lot for me to see. As you clear runs, you can also play through harder “days” with added challenges like tougher enemies or fewer item drops.</p><p>Even though I’m working through bigger games like <em>Astro Bot</em> and a long-in-the-works <em>Mass Effect</em> trilogy playthrough, I keep coming back to <em>Shogun Showdown</em>; it’s just too much fun to experiment with the game’s many weapons and strategies. Maybe it’s time for me to try that dragon punch build again — or stumble into something completely unexpected.</p><p><small>Shogun Showdown<em> is available now on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox</em>.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/following-ps5-pro-pricing-debate-sony-says-pc-setup-can-be-difficult-compared-to-consoles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lifted the shroud of secrecy that surrounded the upcoming PS5 Pro console</a>, consumers and analysts alike have been debating the company's pricing choice. The mid-generation console refresh will cost nearly twice as much as the base PS5 in the United States and actually twice as much in Europe. Analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe</a> it'll still be able to sell around the same as the PlayStation 4 Pro, which accounted for 20% of the total PS4 sales. Moreover, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-like-pc-would-cost-a-fair-bit-more-says-df-rtx-4070-is-the-closest-gpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commented</a> that building a comparable PC would probably cost even more than the $700 Sony is asking.</p>
<p>For its part, Sony pointed to what is, in all likelihood, the key selling point to its userbase: the simplicity of use of the PS5 Pro compared to the PC. Speaking to <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC105XT0Q4A910C2000000/?_gl=1*14lmqbw*_gcl_au*NTk2MjY2NzkwLjE3MjYzODkzODY.*_ga*NDg1OTM4MTczLjE3MjYzODkzODY.*_ga_PXS8451SBG*MTcyNjM4OTM4Ni4xLjEuMTcyNjM4OTY4MC41MC4wLjA." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikkei</a>, Hideaki Nishino (CEO of the Platform Business Group at Sony Interactive Entertainment) said:</p>
<p><em>I think that with mobile devices, there are a lot of games that show ads, and with PCs, the setup can be difficult. With PS, you can immediately enjoy the content you purchased as soon as you turn it on. Even in the stores where you buy software, the products are clearly displayed, making it an intuitive experience.</em></p>
<p>Nishino also confirmed that consoles like the PS5 Pro and the inevitable PlayStation 6 will remain central to the company's gaming business despite the expansion on PC.</p>
<p><em>We are trying to increase the overall game market pie by expanding our content to PCs as well. There is no doubt that our business will be centered on home consoles, but by offering titles for devices other than home consoles, we will reach a wider range of customers.</em></p>
<p>When asked whether the launch of the PS5 Pro would make it more of a challenge to create a successful PlayStation 6 in a few years, Nishino replied:</p>
<p><em>Technology is constantly evolving, so I think there's still more we can do. With the PS5, we've shortened loading times by switching from the hard disk drive (HDD) used in the PS4 era to a solid-state drive (SSD). The sound can now be heard more three-dimensionally through the PS5's controller's speakers, enhancing the sense of immersion. Visual accuracy is important, but we will also be updating other elements.</em></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro will launch globally on November 7. So far, the following games have been confirmed to be optimized for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon's Souls</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-pssr-game-changer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro comes with improved ray tracing capabilities over the base model, but they may not be very transformative. The PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, on the other hand, could be a huge game changer.</p>
<p>The tech experts at Digital Foundry recently commented on the three pillars of the PlayStation 5 Pro in a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">video</a>, highlighting how the system's ray tracing capabilities may not be as transformative as, for example, those introduced by NVIDIA's Turing architecture which powered the RTX 2000 series GPUs. For starters, the technical presentation hosted by Mark Cerny was very vague on the matter and focused on games that already have some sort of ray tracing support, such as Hogwarts Legacy and Gran Turismo 7.</p>
<p>Earlier leaks also indicate smaller additions, and that seems to be what was shown during the technical showcase, although, in Gran Turismo 7's case, the addition of ray tracing during races could be a great showcase of the system's capabilities, as the ray-traced reflections the game already supports are very high-end. Hogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, wasn't a particularly great showcase, as the ray-traced reflections looked grainy, suggesting their low resolution even on PlayStation 5 Pro. The game also ran at 30 frames per second, which is definitely not good, although understandable, given it is an open-world game.</p>
<p>What could be truly game-changing of the three PlayStation 5 Pro pillars is the AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, especially for 4K displays, as similar upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS don't need a very high base resolution to upscale the image to higher resolutions with good image quality. The upscaler could also free some GPU time to allow it to do other things, including better ray tracing. Unfortunately, even PSSR wasn't showcased properly during the technical presentation, according to Digital Foundry, as Sony focused on its first-party titles, which generally sport great image quality even in Performance Mode on the base model. The real test will be with third-party titles, whose image quality is generally not great often due to AMD FSR 2 and Unreal Engine 5 games, which are upscaled from very low resolutions.</p>
<p>Even so, the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-driven upscaler already looks transformative. The upscaler can be retrofitted into existing games without having to upgrade SDK, and it likely requires the same inputs used for implementing AMD FSR 2, so most games should be able to benefit from it with minimal input from developers. With the increased GPU power allowing for games using dynamic resolution scaling to have a better range, which a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/">leaked benchmark</a> also confirmed, the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler could be the system's best feature.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro's 'Big Three' - More GPU Power, AI Upscaling, RT - But Is It Enough?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b3aU311e36Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Whether these improvements will entice players owning the base model to upgrade to the PlayStation 5 Pro remains to be seen, considering its steep price. According to analysts, the console should sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">did</a> despite its $699.99, €799.99 price</p>

				<main>

						<h5>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X Wireless</h5><p><span>May 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>SteelSeries headsets have long been among my favorite wireless gaming headsets. This is not only because of the good sound quality the brand offers but also because of the comfort and battery life these headpieces pack. Back in May of this year, SteelSeries released its Arctis Nova 5X wireless for consoles and PC, and I was happy to be able to get a sample for testing.</p>
<p>I've been testing quite a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-7x-arctis-9-wireless-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5-pc-headset-love-child-dual-wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">few wireless outings</a> from SteelSeries over the past few years with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctis Nova Pro Wireless being the most recent headpiece I reviewed</a>. In the same Nova line, SteelSeries now released the more cost-friendly Arctis Nova 5X wireless headsets. Don't, however, let the €139.99 retail price fool you - this might very well be one of the best wireless gaming headsets in this price range.</p>
<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>
<p>The design of the Nova 5X wireless is similar to other offerings in the Nova series and comes with the brand's iconic ski goggle headband on a plastic headband. Unlike the Pro Nova models, however, the design of this headpiece is all-plastic, but luckily, the build quality feels sturdy. Being a plastic design, the Arctis Nova 5X is lighter than the Pro models, adding to the headset's comfort. The earpads on SteelSeries' mid-range headset are made of breathable fabric, which remains cool on the ears - even after longer gaming sessions. I prefer the fabric to the leatherette used on other headsets. The left and right earcups are easily recognizable via an "L" and "R" print on the mesh inside the earcups, which I prefer over the often tiny indicators on the hinges.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The earcups of the Nova 5X wireless</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left earcup, we find a dedicated mute button for the microphone, the general volume wheel, and a retractable microphone. The right earcup offers the game/chat balance wheel, the power button, and a button to switch between 2.4 GHz mode and Bluetooth. The right cup also houses the USB-C charging port. In addition to powering the headset, the power button also serves as a multifunction button to play/pause music, move between tracks, and increase/decrease call volume. The quick switch button also allows users to answer and end voice calls as well as ignore calls.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The printed "R" inside the right earcup</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nova 5 connects wirelessly via 2.4 GHz through a supplied USB-C dongle. The dongle that comes with the Xbox version of the headset includes a switch that allows users to switch between use on Xbox and other platforms (USB). Interestingly, by picking USB mode, users can also use the headset on PlayStation platforms, whereas the PlayStation version of this headset doesn't allow players to use it on Xbox. As such, those who own both a PlayStation and Xbox might do well to pick the Xbox version of the Nova 5 wireless.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The ski-goggle headband can be adjusted with several notches</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>
<p>Like other offerings from SteelSeries, the Arctis Nova 5 wireless is highly comfortable, partly due to the use of the brand's iconic suspension band but also due to its relatively low weight.&nbsp; Most users will be able to find a good fit, and the headset offers a good seal. Even after longer sessions, I felt no strain at the top of my head - something I, unfortunately, experience frequently, even on higher-priced headsets. As said, the earcups are made of breathable fabric, adding to the comfort when temperatures rise.</p>
<p><strong>Sound quality and battery life</strong></p>
<p>SteelSeries boasts that the Nova 5 Wireless will last 60 hours on a single charge. This is likely under optimal conditions, as I had to charge the headset after roughly 45 hours. Granted, this is when using both the 2.4Ghz connection and Bluetooth at normal volume, and we expect the headset to last longer than that when only using the 2.4Ghz connection. Still, 45+ hours of battery life is great and vastly more than other wireless offerings, including higher-priced ones.</p>
<p>Sound quality is great, especially for a headset in this price range, and I'm convinced you'll be hard-pressed to find a better-sounding headset in this segment. There's plenty of sound separation across the board, and sound effects come through clear enough. A nice addition that makes the sound experience even better is the use of the all-new Nova 5 companion app. This application allows for plenty of customization and packs over 140 EQ presets, including presets for many popular games.</p>
<p>The Nova 5X wireless microphone is easily among the best headset microphones I've used recently, possibly beating those of higher-end headsets. Sound distortion is minimal, and the microphone does a good job of blocking ambient noises.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Arctis Nova 5X and the Companion App" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-Mq1myRYYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>After reading this review, it won't come as a surprise that I'm quite fond of SteelSeries's latest wireless outing. Although it might not be as 'premium' as the brand's Nova Pro line, the Arctis Nova 5X 5 combines great comfort, good sound quality, and a solid microphone for a more than fair price. Multiplatform players looking for a solid wireless headset won't go wrong with this one.</p>

<p>The SteelSeries Nova 5X Wireless offers a great allround package, and might very well be the best in class wireless gaming headset in this price range. </p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone is unravelling, but one event champion has already been crowned. In a dominating display of talent, Toronto Ultra’s ‘Nickool’ claimed the $50,000 winner-takes-all prize, becoming the one player out of an entire lobby of pro competitors to walk away victorious.</p>



<p>While the prize pool for the SOLO YOLO tournament has dropped somewhat of late, it remains one of the most exciting moments of the World Series of Warzone event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vegas-baby">Vegas, Baby</h2>



<p>The SOLO YOLO event at the World Series of Warzone is one of the most entertaining spots in the entire event. In 2021, the first major SOLO YOLO was claimed by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner, a former Call of Duty League competitor and one of the most legendary pro players in the world. Back then, the prize was worth $100,000.</p>



<p>In 2022, Fifakill claimed the $100,000 grand prize, and then last year, Skullface landed 10 kills in a single match to pick up the prize. This year, the prize was halved, but it’s still an exciting moment for Nickool, a relatively small content creator who is now $50,000 richer (after taxes, of course).</p>



<p>We’ve seen a little drama unfold at the World Series of Warzone, which is currently taking place in Las Vegas. Team Falcons’ Diaz Biffle was found to be playing on an inferior PC compared to the other competitors, running with a GPU that fell several steps short of what everyone else was using.</p>



<p>An investigation is ongoing to determine how this happened, but it hasn’t stopped Team Falcons from topping the standings on the first day. This is the same team that won the Warzone category of the Esports World Cup, and they’re expected to pull off a similar victory here at the World Series of Warzone.</p>

<p>It is a sad day for the Valorant scene, after the popular competitor, TenZ, announced his official retirement. In a long video posted on Twitter, the pro Valorant player gave his reasons why he was ready to walk away from competitive Valorant.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tenz-announces-retirement-from-valorant-still-on-sentinels">TenZ Announces Retirement From Valorant; Still on Sentinels</h2>



<p>The famous pro Valorant player shared all of his thoughts on walking away from the competitive Valorant scene earlier today on Twitter in a two-minute video.</p>



<p>“It’s not really easy to say, but I am retiring from competitive play,” said TenZ on Twitter. “I’ve known since the start of this year, I told myself this is my last year, and it was definitely a moment for me to give it my all and play without any regrets.</p>



<p>Known as one of the greatest Valorant players in the world, TenZ and the Sentinels team just recently finished fourth in Valorant Champions 2024, while also finishing first back in March during the VCT 2024: Masters Madrid event.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Playing as a pro player is definitely a big time commitment. You’re committing your entire life to be the best. It is a lot of work and can be quite tiring. There is just a lot of stuff I want to do outside of the game.”</p>



<p>TenZ has already made Valorant history as one of the most decorative players within the game. His skill and competitive gameplay has had a massive impact on quite a few players and fans. Watching him walk away will be tough for many.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-tenz-still-will-stay-with-sentinels-in-the-meantime">TenZ Still Will Stay With Sentinels in the Meantime</h2>



<p>Just because he is retiring from Sentinels, does not mean the famous pro Valorant player will be leaving his beloved team, Sentinels. TenZ also made sure that everyone knew he was still a part of the organization and will be around if they ever needed to sub him in for a tournament.</p>



<p>“They have really created something beautiful here,” said TenZ when talking about the fans behind Sentinels. “There is such a huge backing behind Sentinels. “And overall, it was amazing just being able to play in front of a crowd that was always wearing red and cheering for us in the stands.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With Valorant Champions having just ended a few weeks ago, TenZ’s retirement comes as a shock to many. However, it seems as if the player is set on new things in life and plans to live every day forward to the fullest. Now, who can be upset with that?</p>

It became an obsession for some in the two weeks the website was online, as players fought to fill all the boxes, or undo the work of their peers.
</p>
<p>The fight was far more complicated than it seemed, as the developer recently explained, with some players finding ways to encode hidden messages in the checkboxes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Half a million people visited the site within days of launch. Folks checked 650,000,000 boxes in the 2 weeks I kept the site online," wrote Nolen Royalty <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829268247105138764">in a recent Twitter thread</a>. 
</p>
<p>With so many people playing, Nolen was concerned that people would use the checkboxes to spell out offensive messages on such a vast public canvas. His solution was to make the rows of checkboxes scale to the size of your browser, meaning messages spelled out via checked boxes would only align and be readable at certain widths. 
</p>
<p>"This meant that if you drew something on your phone it wouldn't show up for me on my laptop and vice-versa. I think this worked well; we didn't get bogged down in gross graffiti and since the constraint was subtle most people didn't even notice," he writes.
</p>
<p>This wasn't the only way to create messages in the checkboxes, however. Each checkbox was effectively a bit - the most basic unit of information in computing. A bit is either a 0 or a 1, much like a checkbox is unchecked or checked. 
</p>
<p>At some point, Nolen re-wrote the backend to keep the website online while so many players were using it simultaneously, and he decided "dump the database in ASCII." ASCII is basically the code that stores text in computers. "I have no idea why I did this. I just did it."
</p>
<p>What you'd normally expect to see in this situation is total gibberish, as the checkboxes are converted to random strings of letters and numbers. Instead Nolen found messages - specifically website URLs.
</p>
<p>"A URL with 'catgirls' in it was sitting there in my database and I PANICKED. I thought I'd been hacked! I started searching through my code, searching through my logs, trying to find the problem."
</p>
<p>The website hadn't been hacked, however. Instead, while some players were battling one another to check and uncheck boxes, some others were using the checkboxes to spell out messages in binary. Seemingly they'd written a bot to recreate these message should anyone come along and check or uncheck a vital box. The URL? It pointed to a Discord called "Checking Boxes", where a small number of players had gathered. The players are understandably excited when suddenly the game's creator showed up in their server.
</p>
<p>One of the Discord members then asks Nolen if he's looked at the game as a 1000x1000 image yet. When he did, it looked like this:
</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">So there's a lot going on here! In addition to the drawings, we've got some secrets. There's the binary message I found, but above that is a base64 version of the same message. And we've also got a QR code (with full error correction) that linked to the discord. <a href="https://t.co/DWXhY4yRQq">pic.twitter.com/DWXhY4yRQq</a></p>— nolen (@itseieio) <a href="https://twitter.com/itseieio/status/1829270474964304284?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
<span data-position="2"></span></p><p>"The Discord was full of very sharp teens, and they were writing this message in secret to gather other very sharp teens," writes Nolen. "And it totally worked!! There were 15 people when I joined the discord but over 60 by the time I shut down the site. (the discord is now hidden)"
</p>
<p>Over the course of the two weeks, these players used their bots to create a blue screen of death image that <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829270643596292230">almost filled the entire play area</a>, covered it <a href="https://x.com/itseieio/status/1829270706405638560">in other memes and logos</a>, and even managed to create an animated rickroll:
</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>"It was sick. It was so cool. And I found this so moving," writes Nolen. "I spent my childhood doing dumb stuff on the computer. People mostly didn't get mad at me when I, for example, repeatedly broke my school mail server.
</p>
<p>"There's no way I'd be doing what I do now without that encouragement.
</p>
<p>"So getting to provide some encouragement of my own - providing a playground like this and seeing what folks were doing and telling them how much I loved it - was so deeply meaningful to me."
</p>
<p>"Many people were mad about bots on OMCB. I totally get that. Bots can be frustrating. But the people in this discord were so creative, so talented, so cool! The mischief makers of today will make the games of tomorrow," he concluded. "I can't wait to see what this discord goes on to make".
</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://eieio.games/">Nolen's work</a>, which includes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lets-have-a-staring-contest">staring game</a> we've written about previously, because it evokes an older, more experimental, more playful version of the internet. The tagline of his site is "The internet can still be fun!" and players doing dumb, mischievous stuff is part of that same spirit. Well done, everybody.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Team Liquid is officially the first team to advance to The International 2024 (TI13) Grand Finals after the team swept Gaimin Gladiators with a 2-0 score. While they may be headed to the Finals, other teams, such as Tundra Esports, are still fighting as the gaming organization officially moved towards the Lower Bracket Finals.</p>



<p>For Tundra Esports, the chance of winning The International twice is in their grasp. Team Liquid, however, is proving to put up a worthy fight against any and all of their opponents.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-advance-to-ti13-finals-winning-against-gaimin-gladiators">Team Liquid Advance to TI13 Finals, Winning Against Gaimin Gladiators</h2>



<p>It was a glorious day for Team Liquid in Dota 2 competition, after the esports team was victorious against the Gaimin Gladiators, winning 2-0. The competition was a best-of-three, with Team Liquid’s win advancing them to the Grand Finals.</p>



<p>As of now, we do not know who they will be competing against for the Finals, which is set to take place tomorrow, September 15.</p>



<p>However, the competition may not be settled between Team Liquid and Gaimin Gladiators, as the Gladiators are set to play against Tundra Esports in the Lower Bracket Final later today.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-tundra-esports-advance-to-lower-bracket-finals">Tundra Esports Advance to Lower Bracket Finals</h2>



<p>Tundra Esports also began the day strong, with a victory against Team Falcons, sending the popular esports team back home. Like Team Liquid’s victory today, Tundra Esports also swept the floor, winning 2-0.</p>



<p>But since this was the Lower Bracket, it did not automatically move Tundra Esports to the Grand Finals. The team now has to play against Gaimin Gladiators in the Lower Bracket Finals. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The good news? Tundra Esports is one step away from the Grand Finals. The bad news? Gaimin Gladiators are not going to want to lose again, making their momentum increasingly strong. </p>



<p>Tundra Esports will have to put up quite the fight if they want to make it to tomorrow’s Grand Finals. </p>



<p>Will we see Gaimin Gladiators make a comeback? Or is this it for the popular Dota 2 team?</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-the-shire">Tales Of The Shire: A The Lord Of The Rings Game</a> has been delayed into early 2025. The cosy life sim set in the home of the hobbits had initially been aiming for a late 2024 release, but developers Weta Workshop Game Studio announced they need more time.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien's world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you're hoping for," reads the announcement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240">shared via X</a>. 
</p>
<p>"To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales Of The Shire will now be launching early 2025."
</p>
<p>A Tales Of The Shire showcase stream will show more of the game in action on September 22nd, broadcast on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@talesoftheshire">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/talesoftheshire">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>Edwin already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-is-so-jolly-and-joyful-it-creeps-the-hell-out-of-me">had the chance to play Tales Of The Shire</a> at Summer Game Fest back in June, where he found it so relentlessly winsome as to be uncanny. 
</p>
<blockquote>"Playing Tales Of The Shire at Summer Game Fest has reminded me that the point of the Shire is to be a departed paradise, perpetually eroded by dire events in the East, insert World War-era colonial subtext here. It’s Tolkien’s Green Hill Zone, a gust of sunshine before the plunge into Moria and Mordor. Take away the plunge, and the gust of sunshine grows sinister – intriguingly so, like a hearty overture that’s always threatening to switch to a minor key. I don’t mean any of the above as criticism. This seems as fine and diverting and inconsequential a cosy life sim as any – hardly inventive as a collection of minigames and cottagecore DIY linked by dialogue and some very gentle exploration, but with LOTR fittings to tempt you away from the likes of, say, Dave The Diver. What captivates me about it, though, is what it isn’t, and how it relentlessly thwarts my instinctive sense that everything is about to go to hell. As Sylvia Plath wrote, the flowers are too vivid, too excitable. The air is too balmy."</blockquote>
<p>What a treasure Edwin is. I'm a simpler mind and therefore disturbed solely by the game having the subtitle, "A The Lord Of The Rings Game". There should be a the price to pay for mixing definite and indefinite articles like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wonderful-photography-adventure-toem-will-be-free-from-epic-next-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is a black-and-white photography puzzle adventure that delighted us back in 2021. Next week it's going to be free to keep from the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's just fun, isn't it?" wrote Alice B in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free. No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>Which sounds certainly good enough. Toem will be free to keep between September 19th and September 26th, and you'll be able to grab it from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">Epic Games Store page</a>. You'll need an Epic Games account to do so.
</p>
<p>Toem will be joined by The Last Stand: Aftermath, a roguelite zombie shooter with which I'm unfamiliar. 
</p>
<p>Until Toem appears, there are two other games free to keep from Epic, as usual. Those are <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/super-crazy-rhythm-castle-e3b464">Super Crazy Rhythm Castle</a>, the name of which sort of tells you what you need to know, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rugrats-adventures-in-gameland-737402">Rugrats: Adventure In Gameland</a>, which is a new platformer based on the old cartoon. Perhaps you could say this is somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time - and I have unabashedly fond memories of Rugrats - but I do not want to play this, sorry.
</p>

The company is charging $25.98 for the kit, which it says is a simple, solderless mod.</p><p>8BitDo has made a few of these in the past for old Nintendo controllers, including those for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/2/23746491/8bitdo-nintendo-64-n64-diy-wireless-mod-kit-bluetooth">N64</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/17/17568436/8bitdo-diy-wireless-game-controller">earlier consoles</a>, and now it’s the GameCube’s turn.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-waiting-room-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-will-start-banning-%E2%80%98waiting-room%E2%80%99-channels.981243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-waiting-room-ban/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed by Twitch Support that ‘waiting room’ channels will be banned going forward, under the regulations that rule them as ‘Impersonation’. The team said that elements such as stream title and channel bio will be considered when moderating such streams and that the ruling is mostly aimed at profiles re-using other creators’ content.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stealing-revenue">Stealing Revenue</h2>



<p>In recent months, Twitch has seen a sharp rise in the number of ‘waiting room’ streams that will re-broadcast the content of larger streamers to a smaller audience. They’ll often pose as ‘waiting rooms’ in the sense that you can watch their content until the <strong>actual </strong>streamer goes live on the platform.</p>



<p>In the regulatory update, it was confirmed that reaction streams, even ones that see you react to another user’s live stream, won’t violate the policy. That’s because there’s still an element of active engagement and commentary.</p>



<p>Also, hosting a waiting room stream that’s on hold in anticipation of a new expansion or a ‘character release’, for example, will be fine.</p>



<p>Here’s what Twitch Support said on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To help ensure we enforce accurately, we’ll look at different factors such as stream title and channel bio, as well as whether we’ve received a report from the channel being impersonated. </p>



<p>Our goal is to take action against streams that position themselves as “waiting rooms” – for example, channels that largely re-use other channels’ content without offering commentary or other creative content, and that pull views and potential revenue from the original channel owners.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you think this is a good rule change, or are you a fan of waiting room streams?</p>

<p>It has been reported that ‘around 20’ former Ascendant Studios developers have joined Absurd Ventures, a multimedia organisation set up by Rockstar Games co-founder, Dan Houser. This news comes following a year of strife for Ascendant, which released Immortals of Aveum in August 2023, a game that promptly fell flat in the market.</p>

<h2 id="h-ascending">Ascending</h2>



<p>Absurd Ventures, which is led by Dan Houser, will open a new studio called Absurd Marin, which’ll be based in California. It was stated that the team of around 20 former Ascendant Studios employees will be working on an unannounced ‘story-driven action-adventure title’.</p>



<p>Recently, the team at Absurd Ventures revealed two multimedia universes – A Better Paradise and American Caper. It’s intended that Dan Houser’s company won’t make just games, but instead, it’ll start by publishing a graphic novel and a podcast. </p>



<p>Per the reports, Absurd Marin will be picking up the firm’s first videogame-based project. All we know so far is that it’s a third-person, open-world game — which sounds a bit on the nose considering it comes from the man partly responsible for the creation of Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, things aren’t looking good for Ascendant Studios. This news comes following broad layoffs and the widespread furloughing of the remaining members of staff. It could easily be the next studio to close its doors.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Dan Houser’s first new game away from Rockstar?</p>

            <p>A modder who'd worked to turn cult hit Human Fall Flat into a VR game has revealed that the "creators of the game bought it".</p>
<p>In a handful of tweets on X/Twitter, modder Raicuparta said No Brake Games was "so excited" about the mod, they are now releasing it as an official VR port.</p>

<p>"You might remember some videos of my Human Fall Flat VR mod. And wondered why it was never released," said modder Raicuparta on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"That's because the creators of the game bought it! They were so excited about it that they are now releasing an official VR port with the same concept."</p>
<p>They then appended a video of their "old mod" to the message:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">You might remember some videos of my Human Fall Flat VR mod. And wondered why it was never released.

<p>"To clarify: I had no involvement in the actual development of this official port, and neither did Flat2VR Studios," the modder added. "They just bought all the rights to the concept and code of the unfinished mod (which tbh they didn't really need to do), and then did it all themselves."</p>
<p>As yet there's no formal release date for Human Fall Flat VR, but Steam hints it's "coming soon", whilst the team itself <a href="http://v/">tweeted</a> that it "will be available to purchase from the Meta Store, the PlayStation Store, or on Steam at launch".</p>
<p>The idea for Human: Fall Flat came, at first, via a prototype developer Tomas Sakalauskas who had been commissioned to develop projects for Intel's RealSense camera - a high-end Kinect, effectively, for the PC market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-human-fall-flat-rose-up-to-become-a-smash-hit">In an interview with Eurogamer back in 2018</a>, Sakalauskas says the idea flourished beyond the limitations of the RealSense camera until, eventually, it found its home as a more traditional game - a slapstick action game with physics-enabled comedy powering its puzzles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
