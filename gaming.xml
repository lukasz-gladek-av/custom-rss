            <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has shared the "disappointing news" that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-xbox-physical-edition-gets-a-bit-of-a-delay-due-to-production-issues">physical PS5 North America deluxe editions have been delayed once again</a>, this time to July 2024.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, last night, the team said it was "so hoping not to have to update [...] with any further news of delay", but it had "run into more production issues", further delaying the shipping of physical copies of the North American PS5 version until later this year.</p>

<p>"Due to production changes outside of our control, we have had to follow certain processes specifically set by production companies when manufacturing the PS5 discs, and unfortunately, the approval for particular regions has taken much longer than expected," Larian explained in the statement.</p>
<p>"We expect all PS5 North America copies to be ready in around 14 days - followed by another 10 days to begin delivering these directly to players. We are also in talks with the manufacturer to understand whether it is possible to hire extra temporary staff to reduce assembly times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We have disappointing news to share with you.</p><p>While we were so hoping to not have to update owners of the console physical Deluxe Edition with any further news of delay, we’ve now run into more production issues which means that players who pre-ordered their PS5 North America…</p></div>— Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1794059975746105362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Knowing that there are some of you still waiting to play Baldur’s Gate 3, despite the fact we are unable to substitute physical goods with digital versions, we can only deeply apologise that your preorders have again been delayed," the statement concluded. "By committing to creating physical editions, we were hoping to preserve the almost nostalgic feeling of unboxing your newest game, and this is a commitment we’re hoping to bring into the future with us, this time ensuring we continue to work closely with our partners to manage the planning and production process.</p>
<p>"We’re so sorry it’s taking so long to get your preorder to you, and thank you, for continuing to support us."</p>
<p>The team was able to confirm, however, that Xbox copies are now shipping, as are PS5 versions in the EU and Oceania.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">confirmed its next game will not be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, DLC, or anything else to do with Dungeons and Dragons, but did have other games in development.</p>
<p>Back in April, the studio said it was still "early days" for these projects, with CEO Swen Vincke stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">what's coming will be the team's "best work ever"</a>. An exciting claim given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">monumental success of Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>As for a potential Baldur's Gate 4? Dungeons &amp; Dragons owner Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">recently confirmed</a> it's "talking to lots of partners" about a new game in the series.</p>

How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The free-to-play first-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-release-date-preseason-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XDefiant</a> is reportedly doing big numbers already. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Tom Henderson</a>, the game has become the fastest ever made by Ubisoft to surpass one million unique players. In fact, it has already managed to break through the three million unique player milestone.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that XDefiant is currently outperforming even Ubisoft's rosiest expectations. However, the big question with a live service game like this is whether it can retain players' interest over time. While Call of Duty Modern Warfare III has certainly underwhelmed, the same might not be true for 2024's title, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just been confirmed to be Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft already shared the game's Year 1 roadmap, which will see the introduction of ranked mode and private matches, new arena and progression modes, a welcome list for beginners, practice zones, and ongoing anti-cheat improvements. There will also be four seasons, each coming with three new weapons, three new maps, 90 tiers of Battle Pass, and a new faction. The four factions being added in Year 1 are codenamed Ruby, Buzz, Orchard, and Horde.</p>
<p>For now, the game includes the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>14 maps inspired by other Ubisoft titles</li>
<li>Five Ubisoft franchise-inspired factions (one faction to be earned or purchased): Cleaners from The Division, Libertad from Far Cry, Echelon from Splinter Cell, Phantoms from Ghost Recon, and Dedsec from Watch Dogs</li>
<li>24 weapons</li>
<li>44 attachments</li>
<li>Five devices</li>
<li>Two game modes: Arena and Linear</li>
<li>Arena includes Domination, where teams fight to control three fixed zones; Occupy, in which teams fight to control one zone that periodically moves around the map; and HotShot, where players fight to get the most KOs.</li>
<li>Linear includes Zone Control, where the attacking team works to secure five zones in a progression across the map while defenders must fight to stop them, and Escort, where the attacking team must bring a package to its final destination across the map while the defenders attempt to stymie their progress, and even push the package back.</li>
</ul>
<p>XDefiant also encountered some of the usual launch title snags, such as server issues, although the developers appear to be on top of that.</p>
<p>Have you been playing this game yet? If so, what do you think of it?</p>

The president of Naughty Dog was quoted as saying the PlayStation studio’s next game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.” In a shocking twist, Druckmann now says he never actually said that. </p><div data-video-id="196345" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="126" data-playlist="196345,196424,195719" data-current="196345"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pokémon With Guns And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196345/196345_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21893.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The interview in question</a></span> went up alongside a strategy briefing by Sony to its investors. In addition to praising the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-ai-new-game-1851496423">potential for generative AI</a></span> to transform how games are made, Druckmann appeared to make a grand pronouncement about Naughty Dog’s next, highly-anticipated PlayStation 5 game. “I’m eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of <em>The Last of Us</em>, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” the interview read. </p><p>In addition to getting picked up by several media outlets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-naughty-dogs-next-game-could-redefine-mainstream-perceptions-of-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including <em>IGN</em></a></span> which called it “big words,” the quote also went viral on social media, where it received widespread criticism. The reaction has now prompted Druckmann to correct the record.</p><p>“This is not quite what I said,” the veteran gaming creative tweeted late on May 24. “In editing my rambling answers in my recent interview with Sony, some of my words, context, and intent were unfortunately lost. Well, here’s the full long rambling answer for the final question about our future game.”</p><p>Druckmann then proceeded to share an excerpt of the raw, unedited transcript from his conversation with the anonymous interviewer. In it, he talks about how gaming used to be very niche and siloed off from the rest of the culture when he was growing up, and how that has since changed, in part thanks to hit TV shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-ellie-dina-bella-ramsey-set-photos-1851473070">HBO’s adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-show-amazon-review-1851400505">Amazon’s adaptation of <em>Fallout</em></a></span>. </p><p>“I’m not only excited for this game that we’re making—and it’s, it’s something really fresh for us—but I’m also excited to see how the world reacts to it,” the transcript reads. “Because of <em>The Last of Us</em>, and the success of the show, people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next. I’m very excited to see what the reaction for this thing will be.”</p><p>While interviews are often edited down for clarity and length, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the one published on Sony’s website</a></span> made a surprising number of cuts and, what’s worse, made up a bunch of things Druckmann didn’t actually say, including phrases with very different meanings from anything contained in the original. It raises the question of how many other parts of the interview aren’t accurate paraphrases of what the game designer said or are completely made-up, though presumably if there were more errors Druckmann would have corrected those as well. </p><p>One thing that Sony cut from his response was a moment of humility and graciousness. “I’ve been very lucky to have worked on my favorite games with incredible collaborators and I’m very thankful for them,” Druckmann said. It was a tacit reminder that Naughty Dog’s games are made by hundreds of people.</p><p>Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Other than the Lumina Sword, you will also have access to other weapons such as swift daggers and long-range guns. Find the perfect weapons to suit your fighting style.</p><p>This game features a skill tree system. Upon leveling up, you will receive points that can be spent on unlocking skills that will aid you on your journey.</p><p>The whole game is depicted in Team Ladybug’s critically acclaimed gorgeously animated pixel art, in which each and every frame of every gunshot is painstakingly detailed.

The game is chock-full of story and gameplay content alike, and Team Ladybug’s signature pixel art is being further refined. We’re terribly sorry for the delay, but we hope the improved <em>Blade Chimera</em> will be high-quality and be able to entertain a wide audience.</p><p>The newly released trailer showcases many new boss battles and gimmicks, all painstakingly designed by Team Ladybug. It offers a sneak peek into the world of the game… but in order to let more players get their hands on the actual game experience, <em>Blade Chimera</em> will be joining Steam Next Fest in June (next month!) with a public demo.

After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both humans and the inhuman will find the answer at the end of a cycle of fight and flight.</p><p>Solve puzzles and explore the world, depicted in hand-drawn pixel art. Watch beautifully animated conversations between the main characters. Join a young boy on his adventure and experience his story set in a hardcore sci-fi world.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Boyhood’s End</em> is a juvenile science fiction horror adventure game, in which the world is ruled by a mechanical overlord “R. Karellen.” Every aspect of every person’s life is rated with a “human score,” and R. Karellen decides everything from academic and professional careers, romantic interests, to one’s daily meals.</p><p>The protagonist, Giovanni, has the lowest human score among the entire human race. Every day, he receives “special treatment” for everything including his meals and classes. On top of that, he gets bullied relentlessly by his classmates at the School, both in real life and online.</p><p>But one day, everything and everyone in the school starts attacking Giovanni, trying to “remake” him and raise his human score by making him “more human.” A senior student, the famously eccentric genius Campanella, reaches out to Giovanni, and they hop onto (and take over) a driverless train on the galactic railroad. And so, Giovanni gets swept up in a journey to find the “Crimson Southern Cross,” located at the farthest edge of the universe.</p><p>On their journey, the boys will meet great leaders of the past and pull reckless and destructive “pranks” on them all. Through their encounters with the history, twisted mysteries, and various horrors of the world, they will eventually have to confront the end of their own childhood.</p><p>Oh, did you hear that? The boys are (pointlessly) sounding the train whistle. Looks like it’s time for the galactic express to depart.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Giovanni</strong><ul><li>“Shut up! I couldn’t care less about your twisted logic, but here’s the thing, I’m a human! And you’d better start treating me like one!”</li><li>Has a wanted <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal as a father and the lowest human score in the universe. Gets treated like trash by other people and even the system itself. Has a cynical personality and a sharp tongue, but has a soft spot for his family. Always has to earn money to pay his sister’s hospital fees. Although he lives in an age where humans haven’t had to write programs by themselves for generations, Giovanni knows the ancient craftsman technique of writing his own code from scratch. He frequently uses his coding skills to do shady side gigs on the dark web.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Campanella</strong><ul><li>“Come on, show me! Show me the true potential of humanity! Show me something unpredictable, something that could ruin the world as we know it—something a man-made thing could never do!”</li><li>Has the highest human score in the Gymnasium, and very talented in everything from academics to sports, but also has the highest total score deduction in the Gymnasium due to his frequent eccentric behavior. Talk about extreme. Campanella holds “humans” in high regard, and acts arrogantly around the inhuman and artificially intelligent R. However, many claim to have seen him chatting and playing around with R for no reason in particular.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Worldview Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;Boyhood's End&quot; world view trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJB2_n-9kPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="少年期の終り　世界観PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sa6wqqnJ5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Korean</strong></p><p><iframe title="Boyhood's End 세계관PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72rbzdc4YOA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The year is 2036. Humanity has declined. Misha is a Public Safety Operator: a contractor for the Provisional Government tasked with hunting Youkai, and protecting the Quarantine City of Shin-Chiba. Within the haunted ruins of Tokyo, she unearths a mystery that could unmake what remains of civilization.</p><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is an action-horror shooter about hunting Youkai in the haunted ruins of Tokyo. Combat fuses the tense shooting gameplay of classic survival horror, with the skill-based mechanics and execution of fighting games and spectacle fighters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_884769"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Clutch System</strong> – Misha’s Modular Gun allows her to rapidly switch between Weapon Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games. Efficiently dispatching Youkai requires maintaining a cool head and skillful execution, even as the horrifying creatures close in.</li><li><strong>Legends Brought to Life</strong> – The Youkai that Misha encounters are drawn from urban legends, and Japanese folklore. However, they don’t appear exactly as depicted in the well-known stories. These are the monsters the stories are based on.</li><li><strong>Powerful Status Effects</strong> – Weapon Modules are imbued with various elemental damage types that allow Misha to inflict statuses such as “freeze,” “stun,” or “bleed” upon Youkai. Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to <a title="Genres > Survival [276 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>.</li><li><strong>Build Your Own Combos</strong> – While exploring the ruins of Tokyo, Misha will discover and build up an impressive arsenal of Weapon Modules. Weapon Modules can be slotted into different “Command Slots” in Misha’s Modular Gun, allowing players to choose which command inputs to assign to what modules.</li><li><strong>Lo-Rez Tokyo</strong> – The locations Misha explores in <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> are all based on the real-world districts and neighborhoods of Tokyo. Famous landmarks and beloved streets are realized in a beautiful low-poly aesthetic that is inspired by the early days of 3D video games.</li><li><strong>Kanpai!</strong> – Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City. These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em>, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> is in development for <a title="Platforms > PC [20,139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>).

        <p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite.

During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!<br><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-named-in-school-shooter-lawsuit.881289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-school-shooter-lawsuit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>On the second anniversary of the Uvalde school shooting, two lawsuits were revealed, filed on behalf of the families of the victims against a weapons manufacturer – and Activision Blizzard. The families are being represented by Josh Koskoff, who has gone on record as saying, ‘There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.’</p>



<p>Meta was also named in one of the lawsuits, but the bulk of the litigation is being aimed at Activision Blizzard as the publisher of Call of Duty and Daniel Defense, a manufacturer of the weapon used in the school shooting that left 22 dead and a further 21 injured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-knowingly-exposed">‘Knowingly Exposed’</h2>



<p>At the heart of these lawsuits, which were revealed on May 24, sits a claim that Activision and Meta have joined forces with the weapons manufacturing industry to ‘reach’ young, impressionable people. That’s the damning claim set forth by Koskoff in a statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The truth is that the gun industry and Daniel Defense didn’t act alone. They couldn’t have reached this kid but for Instagram. They couldn’t expose him to the dopamine loop of virtually killing a person. That’s what Call of Duty does.</p>



<p>(Meta and Activision Blizzard) knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Call of Duty has been set forth as a root cause or a figure of blame for a tragic school shooting. In 2012, the Sandy Hook shooter – who also ran rampant in an elementary school – was accused of being obsessed with video games, particularly Call of Duty. It was a few years ago that <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Josh Koskoff successfully led a legal campaign</a> against Remington, the manufacturer of the weapon used in <strong>that </strong>shooting.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard published an immediate response to the lawsuits, stressing that they were sympathetic to the ‘horrendous and heartbreaking’ events that took place in Uvalde in 2022, but ‘Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.’</p>



<p>That has long been the argument in favour of violent video games. When Donald Trump took to a podium in 2019 to ‘take a firm stance’ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fact-check-trump-suggests-video-games-blame-mass-shootings-n1039411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">against violent games</a> like Call of Duty, communities worldwide were quick to highlight that there are two billion gamers, many of which play violent games, and the research indicates that said games <strong>aren’t </strong>influencing them to go on vicious rampages armed with assault rifles.</p>



<p>If the lawsuit is successful against Activision Blizzard, the claims that these games are ‘knowingly promoting dangerous weapons to millions of vulnerable young people’ could have dramatic ramifications against the industry. From Fortnite to Grand Theft Auto, and from Rainbow Six to Battlefield, real-world weapons are replicated in thousands of video games.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Will Also Release on PS4 and Xbox One; Game Said to Launch Late October 2024]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-also-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-game-said-to-launch-late-october-2024.881280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-6-ps4-xo-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will reportedly also release on the last-gen consoles, including the PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>Some days ago, following <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plenty of rumors</a>, Activision officially announced a new entry in the Black Ops series - no subtitle, just Black Ops 6. Aside from releasing later this year on the current-gen consoles and PC, Tom Henderson from Insider Gaming now also reports that the shooter will be released on last-gen consoles, in a similar fashion as last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023-that-familiar-feeling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, retailer GameStop <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1794089299589132780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had listings for the game, mentioning an SKU for PS4 as well</a>. Although there doesn't seem to be a separate Xbox One SKU, Henderson writes that the Xbox Series S|X version is a cross-gen version, which will also work on Xbox One. "Insider Gaming has been able to verify with multiple sources that the image is legitimate and that Black Ops 6 will be coming to past-generation consoles", Henderson writes in his article.</p>
<p>As for when Black Ops 6 will launch, outlet The Verge reports that the title is slated for a late October 2024 release. As <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by Insider Gaming, this likely means that the shooter is dropping on October 25 since the 18th of October would be considered mid-October.</p>
<p>More details about this year's Call of Duty entry will be shared during a special Black Ops 6 Direct broadcast, which will take place immediately after <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's Xbox Showcase on June 9</a>. "<em>Like our double-feature last year with Starfield Direct, immediately following the Showcase we’ll be airing a special deep-dive into the next installment of a beloved franchise", Microsoft wrote last month. "We can’t say much, so for now we’ll call it the Xbox Games Showcase followed by [REDACTED] Direct. This will also be our first Showcase featuring games from our portfolio of studios across Activision, Blizzard, Bethesda and Xbox Game Studios, in addition to titles from our third-party partners.”</em></p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as more information about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 comes in.</p>

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Good graphics forefronter Videlectix <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2442020/view/4146205208844054718?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced</a> then subsequently kicked out the door a new Roomisode for the paramount point-and-click, <em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate</em>. Its nomer has now become a misnomer.</p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">The new roomisode features the eponymous Dangeresque’s counterweight Dangeresque Too as he fights the fickle stubbornness of elevator doors using adventure game logic. That’s all I got, about the new episode, so here are the bullet points from the release:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"> <li>Um, more puzzles</li> <li>Uhh, more cutscenes</li> <li>More entertaining ways to die</li> <li>Single click interface!

 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">As legend has it, <em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode </em>came out in 2008 around the time of the blockbuster <em>Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</em>. Last year, the newly resurr-awoken Videlectrix remastered and re-released it with two new Roomisodes stapled on.</p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Videlectrix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">It’s really good! If I can talk real here, the fact that Videlectrix squished down the point-and-click formula to fit in one room (later three) is quite the design flex. Take that, doors. We don’t need you.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">The new Roomisode, <em>Roomisode X</em> was teased way, way back a few months ago when my life peaked and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-brothers-chaps-of-homestar-runner-fame-talk-about-videlectrix-and-the-future-of-good-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I interviewed the Brothers Chaps</a>. That was a fun time. Let’s all reflect on that for a while.</p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"><em>Dangeresque: The Roomisode Triungulate </em>is available on PC and Linux. <em>Roomisode X</em> should have been glued on there by now.</p>

Those were two of the biggest demands <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">that Epic revealed in April</a>.</p><p>But Judge Donato is indeed considering them. He’s ordered Google to calculate the costs of complying with those demands by June 24th, one month from today:</p><div><blockquote><p>Google will file by June 24, 2024, a proffer stating in detail the tech work required and economic costs, if any, to provide “Catalog Access” and “Library Porting” to competing app stores for a period of up to 6 years. See MDL Dkt. No. 952 at 7. The proffer may also address tech work and economic costs for the distribution of third-party app stores through the Google Play Store.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p>MDL Dkt. No. 952 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128531/epic-google-proposed-injunction-remedies">Epic’s 16-page list of asks</a>, and 7 is the page that would force Google to give <em>other</em> app stores access to the entire Google Play catalog of apps, should Epic get its way. Take a peek:</p><p>Just below “Catalog Access and Library Porting” is the other huge ask Judge Donato seems to be considering: that Google would carry other third-party app stores within its Google Play store for six years.</p><p>According to the order, Epic will get a chance to question Google’s experts and engineers about the accuracy of their estimates, and file a rebuttal, before a final hearing on August 14th. In an evidentiary hearing yesterday, Judge Donato <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163907/google-epic-world-of-chaos-antitrust-monopoly-case">seemed extremely skeptical</a> of Google’s arguments against Epic’s proposed remedies, but also suggested that some of Epic’s asks were “open-ended and too vague.”</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163383/spotify-car-thing-discontinued-december-2024"><h2>Spotify is going to break every Car Thing gadget it ever sold</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24162896/google-ai-overview-hallucinations-glue-in-pizza"><h2>Google promised a better search experience — now it’s telling us to put glue on our pizza</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163826/apple-iphone-ios-17-5-update-deleted-photos-explained"><h2>Here’s why deleted iPhone photos returned to some iOS devices</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24163867/samsung-galaxy-watch7-ultra-leak-square"><h2>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 ‘Ultra’ leaks show a supersized squircle for your wrist</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/samsung/2024/5/23/24162135/ifixit-end-samsung-repair-parts-deal"><h2>iFixit is breaking up with Samsung</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both suits arrive on the two-year anniversary of the shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School. The documents claim that Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense each took part in "grooming" the gunman to be a mass shooter.</p><p>Activision and Meta are being sued, essentially, for the roles the documents allege they played in promoting the gun used in the shooting to 18-year-old Salvador Ramos. The Uvalde families are being represented by lawyer Josh Koskoff, best known for reaching a $73 million settlement with the maker of another AR-15-style rifle that was used in the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting.</p><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties,” Koskoff says.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/uvalde-1716591211262.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The families of Uvalde shooting victims are suing Activision, Meta, and Daniel Defense. (Image credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ramos allegedly bought the gun a week before the shooting, just 23 minutes after his 18th birthday, the suit alleges. Koskoff argues that this came months after he started playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare which, according to the lawyer's account, began a spiral of the teenager becoming obsessed with guns. The gun that Ramos did end up purchasing, a DDM4 V7, was featured on Modern Warfare's opening title page, the lawsuit says.</p><p>“Within a week of downloading Modern Warfare on Nov. 5, 2021, the shooter’s phone indicates a growing obsession with weapons and accessories associated with the game," Koskoff says, according to the NYT. </p><p>The suit goes onto allege that, by December 2021, Ramos was looking into Daniel Defense, reasearching what models he might use, and making several Instagram posts about weapons. In the process, Koskoff claims, the teenager was "targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense."</p><p>"This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it," Koskoff says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Daniel Defense is a predator but can’t get to the prey without the help of these other third parties.</p></div><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-shooting-families-wrongful-death-lawsuit-meta-activision-daniel-defense/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS News</a>, Koskoff added that Instagram created a "connection" between the gunman and the gun manufacturer.</p><p>"And nobody exploited Instagram for this purpose more than Daniel Defense," he said. "If Instagram can prevent people from posting pictures of their private parts, they can prevent people from posting pictures of an AR-15. And of course, Instagram doesn't care. They don't care. All they care about is driving traffic and generating attention, drawing attention and getting their ad revenue."  </p><p>Meta and Daniel Defense did not immediately respond to IGN's request for comment. When reached by IGN, Activision issued the following statement:</p><blockquote>The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence. Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.</blockquote><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) has also issued the following statement, more broadly addressing violence in video games:</p><blockquote>We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence. At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence.</blockquote><p>The new lawsuits come just days after the same 19 Uvalde families <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uvalde-school-shooting-settlement-texas-city-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached a $2 million settlement</a> with the Texas city, in which they were also represented by Koskoff. They also announced a number of new lawsuits against the Texas Department of Public Safety officers and Uvalde's school district, including one $500 million suit against nearly 100 state police officers. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Wu Xiaoling/Xinhua via Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

As noted in the lawsuit, the families accuse Activision and Meta of “grooming” young men and putting them on a path toward violent acts. On May 24th, 2022, 18-year-old Salvador Ramos opened fire at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, killing 21.</p><p>The lawsuit says that the gunman played <em>Call of Duty </em>“obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewards that become available only after a substantial time investment.” It also claims that the game features the AR-15 used in the shooting. At the same time, the lawsuit alleges that “the shooter was being courted through explicit, aggressive marketing” on Instagram that showed “hundreds of images depicting and venerating the thrill of combat.”</p><div><p>“Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill”</p></div><p>In addition to Activision and Meta, the families of the Uvalde victims are also suing Daniel Defense, the gun company that made the AR-15 used in the shooting. The lawsuit alleges Daniel Defense promotes its weapons to minors on Instagram through posts “glorifying” combat. Meta’s rules <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/09/facebook-gun-sellers-10-strikes/">theoretically</a> ban companies from selling guns on its platforms, though, and the gunman purchased the AR-15 from Daniel Defense’s website — not through Instagram. </p><p>Section 230 immunizes platforms from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21262248/supreme-court-rejects-stuart-force-facebook-section-230-lawsuit-algorithms">civil lawsuits such as these</a> if they arise from posts made by their users, though things are a little more complicated in cases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23889747/facebook-biased-ad-algorithm-aclu-court">where a platform’s targeted advertising</a> is the primary issue. Meta didn’t immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p><p>“Companies like Instagram and Activision do more than just allow gun companies to reach consumers — they underwrite and mainstream violence to struggling adolescents,” wrote Josh Koskoff, the attorney for the Uvalde families. “Instagram should stop enabling the marketing of AR-15s to kids by gun companies; and Activision should stop training and habituating kids to kill. It’s that simple.”</p><div><p>Video game companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/5/17082832/video-game-industry-esa-trump-meeting-violence-school-shooting-controversy">have long pushed back</a> on the idea that video games can cause real-world violence, something <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754793/trump-gun-control-video-games-violence-republicans-no-evidence-dayton-el-paso-texas-ohio">politicians have often claimed following mass shootings</a>. However, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">research has shown</a> that video games don’t cause violent acts, and lawsuits targeting video game companies for the actions of other school shooters have failed.</p></div><p>In a statement provided to <em>The Verge</em>, Activision’s head of corporate communications Delaney Simmons writes: “Millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts.”</p><p>Koskoff previously won <a href="https://www.koskoff.com/in-the-news/sandy-hook-families-achieve-historic-victory-holding-gunmaker-accountable-for-role-in-school-massacre/">a $73 million settlement</a> for the families of Sandy Hook school shooting victims from gun manufacturer Remington.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The book takes fans on a frame-by-frame journey through the expansion's seven bosses and The King's Leap challenge arena. Delicious Last Course also introduced Ms. Chalice as a playable character and numerous new NPCs who will likely be featured in this art book.</p><p>If you've played Cuphead, you know the level of detail on display in each of the game's inventive boss battles. The DLC actually has as many frames of animation as the base game, despite it only comprising about 25% of the full Cuphead experience. The Art of Cuphead, which focuses on the base game, is a fascinating, must-have book for fans, so we'd expect The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course to provide a similarly insightful look inside Studio MDHR's creative process.</p><p>Along with frame-by-frame animation of the bosses you can find in The Delicious Last Course, this book contains early concept art as well as unused ideas.</p><p>With Amazon's preorder price guarantee, you'll get The Art of Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course for the lowest price offered between the time you order and release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>XDefiant is an FPS with an identity crisis. This arcade-style arena shooter pulls characters and locations from various Ubisoft games, and it feels a little bit like a lot of different things as a result: It's fast and twitchy in a way that’s similar to games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-multiplayer-review">Call of Duty</a>, but has class abilities that might put it closer to something like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a>. It’s got fast respawns and faster deaths, but offers objective-based modes that prioritize teamwork over straight killcount. That combination of disparate elements helps XDefiant play a little differently overall from most competitive shooters, but it also makes it feel a bit jumbled, like its parts aren’t always working together toward the same goals.</p><p>Call of Duty figured out the fun of grounded but fast-paced competitive play in this vein way back in the late 2000s, and XDefiant is clearly chasing that same success with its solid FPS design. Though the weapons are all pretty standard for military shooters like this, they still feel distinct and satisfying to use – the AK-47 hits harder and kicks a little differently than the M41A, for instance, and it feels meaningful to pick one over the other for your play style. Guns are also, for the most part, appropriately deadly, but you'll get the most out of them when you spend time mastering the way recoil pulls your aim and what benefits you get from equipping a specific scope or stock. XDefiant pairs that with class abilities like healing teammates, dropping shields, and launching explosive drones, which can change the flow of a fight when they're used well, but they're not so powerful that they ever override the emphasis on its central shooting mechanics.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>If nothing else, this is a fun shooter where the gunplay feels good, and you can do a whole lot worse than that as a solid foundation. It's the other stuff layered on top of that gunplay, however, that XDefiant struggles to mix into a coherent whole.</p><p>The hook is that XDefiant is a sort of multiverse of different Ubisoft worlds combined into a single competitive shootout. When you jump into a match, you choose a character from one of four factions based on Ubisoft’s games (a fifth can be unlocked through gameplay or purchased), which function as your classes, and they're all <em>just</em> distinct and interesting enough to play differently without feeling like they’re mismatched and shoehorned into the same game. The Libertad faction from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/far-cry-6-review">Far Cry 6</a>, for example, is essentially a medic class. They recover from damage faster and can either fire off a fast-heal charge in a radius around the player who activates it, or drop a stationary device that slowly heals anyone nearby. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/10/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review">Ghost Recon</a> Phantoms are tanks that don’t die quite as quickly as other factions. They're able to either deploy a stationary barrier that they and their allies can shoot through, or pull out a personal riot shield that's pretty effective at stopping bullets in both directions. There are also factions based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/20/the-division-2-review">The Division</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/watch-dogs-legion-review">Watch Dogs</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review">Splinter Cell</a>, and like in any class-based shooter, picking the right ability at the right time is important enough that it can change the flow of a fight. But you’re not locked into that choice for the whole match, so every time you kill an enemy you know they can adapt to your strengths and come back as a new class with a different set of skills. Knowing how and when to counter an enemy’s abilities is almost as important to your team as your aim.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each faction mostly feels pretty distinct, but some definitely stand ahead of others.</p></div><p>The final major difference between each faction is their ultra ability: This big special power can only be used after you've charged it by racking up kills or scoring points toward objectives, but unlike many games’ ultimate abilities, there’s usually a way for the other team to shut them down if you’re not careful. For instance, the Phantoms’ ultra gives them a personal energy dome that protects them from all damage coming from outside of it, but opponents who are quick and smart – and avoid the defensive cannon – can slip through and kill whoever’s generating it, canceling the ability. The same is true of the Libertad healing device that pumps up anyone in its vicinity to double health. Enemies might seem nigh invulnerable while standing in its range, but you can shoot the device <em>itself </em>to destroy it and make them mortal again. In that way, ultras are generally strong without being ridiculous and require you to be smart about how and when to use them.</p><p>Still, it's important to add a caveat: while each faction <em>mostly</em> feels pretty distinct, balanced, and fun, some definitely seem to stand ahead of others, and a few come off as completely useless (unless the community just hasn’t figured out how to use them yet). The biggest offender on this front is DedSec from Watch Dogs, whose gameplay style leans toward hacking enemy abilities. Their deployable spider drones automatically chase down the other team and shock or totally blind them, leaving them fully vulnerable – pretty cool. Their other ability, however, allows you to hijack the other team's deployables, and I’ve yet to see a single person use it effectively. There just aren't that many things to steal or many opportunities to do so, and every time I tried to sneak up to a shield or health station to try to hack it, I was killed – by the players who, of course, were currently using the thing I wanted to hijack. That’s especially egregious because you either need to pay $10 to unlock DedSec, or sink a whole lot of time into playing the other four factions to earn it for free.</p><p>On the flipside, other abilities feel overly strong. The Echelon faction, which is inspired by the stealthy gameplay of Splinter Cell, can either become nearly invisible or activate a pulsing sonar ability that lets your whole team see enemies through walls. Their ultra ability, Sonar Goggles, greatly increases the range of that legalized wallhack and gives you the 5.7 pistol, which fires slowly but takes enemies down in one or two hits. The only way to deal with the Sonar Goggles, as far as I can tell, is just to kill whoever's using it. Where the other factions have abilities that are a lot more situational or team-oriented, there's basically no drawback here – it’s never not to your advantage to see through walls. The lack of effective balance at launch means some classes are more popular than others in matches, and that weakens the faction system overall.</p><p>Generally, though, the larger issue with abilities is that they don't really fit with XDefiant's “the quick and the dead” approach to gunfights. Since shootouts are often over almost as soon as they begin, a lot of abilities are just a non-factor in most situations. Firing off a heal or launching an explosive drone delays you from shooting back, which means you'll almost definitely die when all it takes to drop you is a couple of hits. That means you must have a Jedi-like sense of what <em>will </em>happen to make real use of them, like leaving a healing device or a shield where you think a fight is about to break out or launching an explosive drone toward where you anticipate someone to be. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Abilities don't really fit its “the quick and the dead” approach to gunfights.</p></div><p>Why equip the moltov of The Division's Cleaners faction, which you'll only be able to use if you get within a few feet of an opponent, when you could choose the Phantom's deployable shield and have several seconds of free shots at any distance? What good is the ability to hack a healing device from up close if sniping it from a distance is much more effective at neutralizing it without dying?</p><p>Balancing is an issue with some weapons at the moment, as well. The longer I played XDefiant, the more people started appearing in lobbies wielding sniper rifles, and it quickly became clear why: Sniping very often gets you a one-hit kill regardless of where the shot hits your target. Even at close ranges, if you can draw a bead on someone and snap off a shot, you'll likely drop them before they have a chance to double-tap you. Skilled players picked up on this very quickly, and if you jump in today you'll probably find yourself getting taken out instantly, regardless of how far away the enemy is. It quickly made me feel like a chump for opting for a different gun. So I guess I’m a sniper now.</p><p>It’s only partly because of the sniper advantage that shotguns and light machine guns feel a bit useless at the moment. Both have significant drawbacks; shotguns have very short range and slow firing rate, while LMGs seem to be tuned more to destroy enemy devices like shields and appear to do less damage to actual enemies. Both weapon types seem to punish you for choosing them over assault rifles or submachine guns, which have fewer drawbacks.</p><p>None of that is a dealbreaker, though, because XDefiant doesn’t care if your kill:death ratio is negative, so long as you’re helping your team get closer to the match objective. You don’t have to be among the fastest guns on the internet to grab a riot shield and focus on surviving long enough to push a payload from one end of a map to the other, or play support or defense on capture points by helping to keep your more lethal teammates alive. All of that is good fun, but it could certainly use a few more game modes with more imaginative and interesting approaches to shaking up gameplay in order to prevent us from falling into a routine for a bit longer.</p><p>XDefiant has only five modes at the moment, all of which are fairly standard fare for this kind of shooter. Those modes all support six-on-six unranked play – XDefiant will also have a four-on-four ranked mode, which will use skill-based matchmaking, but it's only available as a preview right now. Zone Control, Domination, and Occupy are variations on capture-point modes, with Occupy taking place on a linear map while the other two are played in XDefiant's big, dense arenas. That cuts down on variety, and a lot of the matches you'll play during any given session start to feel repetitive pretty quickly. Whether you’re capturing one control point that moves around the map, three simultaneously, or several in a specific order, it doesn’t change the gameplay enough to really differentiate those modes from each other.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The modes don't excite, but the maps themselves are largely standouts.</p></div><p>Meanwhile, Hotshot is a version of Call of Duty's Kill Confirmed in which you only score if you pick up a dropped item after a kill, but there’s an added VIP twist: The person with the most items becomes speedier and scores more points for every item they pick up, so you want to protect your own team’s Hotshot and hunt down opposing ones. Escort, on the other hand, is a straight-up payload mission on a linear map, with no meaningful differences from the mode that's been in Overwatch for years (and in Team Fortress 2 before that), so it’s not terribly novel or innovative. Neither of these options do much to play to XDefiant's particular strengths or help differentiate it from other games.</p><p>The maps themselves, on the other hand, are largely standouts. Ten are arenas and four are linear, and they all borrow liberally from the same games from which XDefiant pulls its factions to make for visually interesting and varied spaces. For the most part they're highly open, with multiple pathways in and out of any given place. That means you're as likely to get shot in the back as you are to get the drop on someone, but it's nice that they encourage fast movement and a minimal amount of camping, and facilitate a lot of different types of engagements with just about every step. That helps make all of the factions and weapons feel viable (except maybe DedSec), at least from a playstyle perspective; running around with a shotgun is just as fun as hanging back with a sniper rifle, even if the power of the guns themselves are a little uneven. The open design also keeps things fair, as there are no locations where someone can hide and dominate alone with a sniper rifle or where a team can hunker down to make themselves nearly invulnerable.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Phil Hornshaw's Favorite Class-Based Shooters</h3><p>Teamwork makes the dream work.</p></div><p>There's also a fairly expansive (if basically standard at this point) progression system that unlocks weapons, weapon attachments like scopes, and various faction characters as you play. Additional pieces for are unlocked for a weapon just by using it, so you can start to kit out guns to your liking after a few rounds with them. Additional guns and characters require completing challenges by using the weapons you have in specific ways, like earning point-blank SMG kills or notching a certain number of one-shot snipes. The challenges help encourage you to vary your playstyle, and none of them are arduous to unlock – they perfectly balance pushing you to experiment with different loadouts and gear, while quickly rewarding you with new weapons for your trouble.</p><p>The same can't be said of the grind to unlock the DedSec faction, however. Four factions are available when you start in XDefiant, but the fifth requires earning some 700,000 experience points from completing objectives, scoring kills, finishing and winning matches, and completing daily challenges. To put that in perspective, a kill gets you 100 XP, a finished match earns 2,000 – and another 2,000 if you win – while the four challenges available each day range from 5,000 to 10,000 XP. That makes it a fairly intense grind to do for free, but of course you can unlock DedSec instantly if you're willing to fork over $10. But again, given how weak that faction seems to be with the current balance, neither the grind nor the cost seems especially worth it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>XDefiant joins the free-to-play shooter crowd as a respectable competitive FPS built around various Ubisoft franchises, but little makes it really stand out. Its shooting mechanics generally feel great, and even dying doesn’t kill the momentum since you're dropped right back into the action within a few seconds. Some of its issues, like weapon balance, are relatively minor elements that we can expect Ubisoft to adjust over time. Tougher to solve, however, is the clash between its main ideas: fast time-to-kill makes a lot of its class abilities feel difficult to make the most of because you’re usually dead before you can use them. It’s also lacking a defining mode, leaning on samey point-capture ideas and tried-and-true but tired concepts like Payload and Kill Confirmed. On the other hand, excellent maps keep things interesting longer than they otherwise would be, so hopefully it’ll have the time it needs to carve out its own niche.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You're a cute cat piloting a cozy armored mech in this game, a metroidvania with stylish monochromatic visuals. As you trek through an alien underworld full of irritable creatures and treacherous obstacles, you'll get closer to rescuing your stranded captain and salvaging his crashed spaceship. You'll need to blast and dash through dangerous terrain, as well as venture outside the mech and risk all nine lives to access areas and uncover cool secrets.</p><p>Gunbrella will see you engage in side-scrolling action as you use the lethal rain-deflecting tool to glide, swing, dash, and shoot your way through people who are out for your head.

            <p>
Skull and Bones - Ubisoft's extraordinarily long in the works (and not particularly good) open-world pirate adventure - is getting a free week-long trial next week, and it'll coincide with the launch of the live-service game's second season of post-launch content.
</p>
<p>
When Skull and Bones released in February - some 11 years after its troubled development started - Ubisoft trumpeted "record player engagement", but did not share sales figures. It's unclear just how well the pirate game has done for the publisher, then, but Ubisoft evidently believes it needs a bit of a boost given its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/free-weekend">impending week-long trial</a>.
</p>
<p>
That'll take place across all platforms - Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5 and PC (via Epic and Ubisoft Connect) - from Thursday, 30th May until Thursday, 6th June. During that time, players can sail as much as they like with access to the whole thing, and progress will be carried over should they decide to purchase the full game. And to tempt those wallets out, Ubisoft is slashing the price of Skull and Bones by 50 percent across all platforms for a "limited time".

<p>
Skull and Bones' free week-long trial coincides with the game's second season of post-launch content, which launches on 28th May. Ubisoft hasn't said much about what it'll bring, but there's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8mjbgIwj-c">story trailer to watch</a> and a bit of teasing blurb. "The Hubac Twins have been dispatched by the Compagnie Royale to seize control of the Indian Ocean and eliminate the pirate scourge," it writes. "Demonstrating dangerous abilities through song, they blaze across the high seas, hunting pirates in a violent duet and laying claim to the region's riches."
</p>
<p>
And is it worth your time? I wasn't especially convinced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">in my two star review</a> earlier this year. "There are moments when Skull and Bones weaves a convincing spell," I wrote. "Cannon balls flying in ship-to-ship combat, impromptu engagements with other players, the brief dopamine rush when a resource slog culminates in a shiny new toy, or even when the light hits just right on another glorious view. But it's soon swept away on a tide of uninspiring fetch quests and tedious traversal that just can't sustain its live-service grind. Skull and Bones is okay, fine even, on rare occasions maybe even great - but, ultimately, it comes down to this: no game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."

<p>When DOOM: The Dark Ages launches, it won’t be an Xbox Series X|S console exclusive. According to one insider, DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PlayStation 5 (PS5) as well.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1794109253856161986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nate the Hate said that the game </a>will be multiplatform. While specifically mentions PS5 as another platform for the game, he doesn’t mention last-gen Xbox One or PlayStation 4.  </p>



<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled to be revealed</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. The game has been in development for four years and will be set in a “medieval-inspired” world. Prior to getting an official name, the game was known as “Year Zero”.</p>

<p>As of publishing, it’s unclear when the game will be released. Releasing the game on PS5, however, falls in line with Microsoft’s plan to bring its first-party games to other platforms. The company aims to bring “Xbox to every screen”, including its games.</p>

                <p>On May 24, 2022, Salvador Ramos entered his former school, Robb Elementary, in Uvalde, Texas, and murdered 19 children and two teachers, while injuring 17 others. Now, on the two-year anniversary of the school shooting, the families of the Uvlade victims have filed multiple lawsuits, including one in California that's targeting Call of Duty publisher Activision and Facebook and Instagram's parent company, Meta, for their alleged role in putting the gun in the killer's hands.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/05/24/uvalde-lawsuits-daniel-defense-meta-activision/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Washington Post</a>, the lawsuits were filed by attorney Josh Koskoff, who contends that Activision and Meta share responsibility for "grooming... socially vulnerable" young men with violent video game fantasies. The complaint also states that both companies "knowingly exposed the Shooter to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as the solution to his problems, and trained him to use it."</p><p>"Over the last 15 years, two of America’s largest technology companies--Defendants Activision and Meta--have partnered with the firearms industry in a scheme that makes the Joe Camel campaign look laughably harmless, even quaint," continues the complaint. "To put a finer point on it: Defendants are chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters."</p><p>As spelled out in the lawsuit, the families allege that Ramos downloaded a copy of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare that features the same DDM4V7 model rifle that he later purchased and used for the school shooting. Additionally, it accuses Meta of sending Ramos targeted ads for the same gun on Instagram from the manufacturer, Daniel Defense.</p><p>Meta doesn't allow gun manufacturers to purchase direct advertisements for weapons or explosives. But the lawsuit suggests that Daniel Defense got around that restriction by posting promotional material about the weapons on the company's Facebook and Instagram accounts. A separate lawsuit was also filed by the families against Daniel Defense.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision for comment.</p>

<p data-characters="119" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Not many<em> EA FC 24</em> players would have expected the Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC to arrive in Ultimate Team, but it is here. </p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">The Nigerian attacker scored a memorable hattrick to win the Europa League with Atalanta. As a tribute, EA Sports has released a special card that can be obtained by completing three different tasks. This SBC is one of the easier ones as far as recent releases are concerned. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-ademola-lookman-rttf-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">All three tasks have different stipulations, which makes it slightly tricky for players. That said, the conditions for completing the tasks are pretty easy to manage. In fact, this SBC is even easier to complete than the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-trinity-rodman-tots-sbc-cheapest-solutions/">Trinity Rodman TOTS challenge</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="22" data-current-count="22" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Serie A</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM</li> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-ademola-lookman-rttf-sbc-cheapest-solutions" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC cheapest solutions</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">The Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC is certainly among the cheaper challenges that you can currently complete in <em>EA FC 24</em>. If you compare this challenge with other SBCs like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-trinity-rodman-tots-sbc-cheapest-solutions/">Trinity Rodman TOTS</a>, the difference in difficulty of completion will be crystal clear. Nevertheless, always opt for the cheapest solutions to save more in-game resources for future uses. </p>

 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">The Ademola Lookman RTTF SBC costs around 120,000 coins, but you can always save resources by sourcing fodder from your Ultimate Team inventory. This special SBC offers a 93-rated ST item, which can also operate in wider positions of the pitch. </p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="false">While the 93-overall rating could have been higher, I love the 5* Skills and 5* Weak Foot. The Technical+ and First Touch+ should make this card feel amazing when you try to dribble. For its price, you can’t really go wrong by completing this SBC in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. As an alternative, the Renato Sanches Flashback SBC offers a solid midfield card and dominates in the middle of the pitch. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164247/apple-tetris-stacker-ipod-prototype-tony-fadell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>YouTuber <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dq0c6SOP4CCo">Apple Demo</a> has found a prototype third-generation iPod that contains a game called Stacker, which never made it to retail models. In addition to Apple’s own version of Tetris, the engineering sample iPod also came loaded with other unreleased titles, including games called <em>Block0</em> and <em>Klondike, a</em>s noted by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-built-a-tetris-clone-for-the-ipod-but-never-released-it-173810144.html?src=rss"><em>Engadget</em></a>. </p><p>On the back of the prototype iPod, a “DVT” (Design Validation Testing) label is etched where the storage capacity normally goes, which, Apple Demo explains indicates it was from the middle stage of development. Two songs still in its storage and a helpfully-named playlist suggest this device was used for battery testing.</p><p>After some tinkering and transplanting the internal hard disk into a second-generation iPod Apple Demo got the hard disk to boot as normal, and out of the games available, they only demoed Stacker.</p><p>They even contacted the ex-SVP of Apple’s iPod division, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23053632/tony-fadell-build-decoder-apple-iphone-google-alphabet-steve-jobs">Tony Fadell</a>, to learn why the Tetris clone was never released. However, Fadell’s only comment, from 2022, says, “because we added games with later software release,” leaving the internal story of Stacker a mystery for now. Apple did release a licensed Tetris game years later on the “Classic” iPod models, which supported new game titles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/27/3417870/apple-ipod-click-wheel-games-history">purchased from the iTunes Store</a>.</p><p>Stacker uses the iPod’s click wheel to move falling blocks left and right, and the center button drops them to the bottom of the screen. The objective, like Tetris, is to shoot for a high score by completing and clearing lines of bricks and not overstacking pieces off the top. The game isn’t entirely polished — there’s at least one bug shown in the video where a brick overlapped a stack and got stuck when rotated. But it works!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
