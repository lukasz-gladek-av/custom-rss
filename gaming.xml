            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-and-stellar-blade-both-set-new-concurrent-user-records-on-steam-this-weekend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> have set new concurrent user records on Steam over the weekend.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening, which released 10th June for all, and Stellar Blade, which had its long-anticipated PC debut on 11th, both launched with comparatively few problems, and their success has been underlined by the number of players getting stuck in over the weekend. At the time of writing, Dune: Awakening has secured an all-time concurrent peak of 175.5K players, and Stellar Blade 192K.</p>

<p>That puts both games in the top ten of most-played games of the weekend, with just <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, and Apex Legends attracting more players.</p>
<p>The PlayStation-published Stellar Blade made its way onto PC earlier this week and within hours of release, it was already the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-pc-debut-welcomes-record-numbers-for-a-playstation-published-single-player-release">most successful PlayStation-published single-player game on the platform by concurrent count</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>In comparison, Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered has a peak player count of 66,436, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Complete Edition has a peak of 56,557, The Last of Us Part 1 has a peak of 36,496 and its sequel - The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered - has a peak of 30,690. Only Helldivers 2 has attracted more players at once, but that's, of course, a multiplayer title.</p>
<p>Dune Awakening soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release, quickly surpassing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five-day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition. Within hours of the full launch, it blew past 113,000 players and currently has a concurrent record of 175K.</p>
<p>Not sure if either game is for you? In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Eurogamer's original Stellar Blade review</a>, we noted it "has a fair bit of weirdness", but " its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced". Meanwhile, Connor's having a great time with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Dune: Awakening thus far, writing in our review-in-progress</a>: "It's too early for a full review, but as of right now, I see little reason not to recommend giving Dune Awakening's unique offering a chance."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There hasn’t been a truly new entry in the series since 2014's <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, so being stoked to dive into this exciting adventure is perfectly reasonable. Equally reasonable, especially given the game’s controversial price tag, is to wonder how long it’ll take to beat and what type of replayability it offers. Let’s talk about it. - Billy Givens </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-how-long-to-beat-open-world-campaign-1851784366?_gl=1*10o91ha*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NzgyMCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-how-long-to-beat-open-world-campaign-1851784366?_gl=1*10o91ha*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NzgyMCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ae9cde5a08a8feed1ab8856ad8b24fa" data-recommend-id="image://6ae9cde5a08a8feed1ab8856ad8b24fa" data-format="gif" data-width="1032" data-height="569" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A racer drives behind a car throwing coins.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-next-generation-of-rpgs-unlock-the-absurd-character-choices-of-our-dreams<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Once BioShock Infinite’s protagonist Booker DeWitt arrives in the floating city of Columbia, the local police set about getting a description of the False Prophet they’ve anticipated for so long. Only trouble is, they’ve spent years whipping the populace into a frenzy of xenophobic fear. And when they speak to eyewitnesses, bigoted terror is all they’re getting back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We hear on the radio that Booker is either a mixed-race dwarf, or a French man with a missing left eye - no more than four foot and nine inches. And when DeWitt stumbles across a sketch artist putting together a facial composite, the overheard conversation is farcical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He was taller than that… slimmer. His eyes were further apart. Bigger than that. Squinty. His hair was… hmm, red and curly? He looked Irish to me. Yes, like that. Oh, he was certainly an anarchist. You can spot them anywhere, you know.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s silly, but it’s one of BioShock Infinite’s subtlest touches - a way for developer Irrational Games to demonstrate how a backward society is undone by its own narrow belief system. And it sprung to mind during this summer’s Xbox Showcase, where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a> finally got an extensive reveal.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/clockwork-revolution-1749831208949.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Clockwork Revolution's steampunk world is rife with absurd role-playing opportunity. | Image credit: InXile</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock Infinite was the immediate and obvious reference point for a first-person action game dealing in turn-of-the-century Victoriana and time-twisting mechanics. While we’ll be “playing in the mud”, not up in the skies, InXile’s new game depicts a society where power imbalance has led to a powder keg atmosphere. Here, shootouts are fought with old-timey rifles and temporal magic on factory floors. With a flick of your wrist, you can turn a pile of rubble back into a wall, then take cover behind it. It’s all very consistent with our memories of Irrational’s swansong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even an early scene in which an aristocrat, fizzing with outrage in the lobby of a police station, offers an eyewitness description of a burglary suspect. “Tall… built rather slim,” the lord mutters to a mechanical constable. “Well, muscular. Was very quick, agile. With a moustache. No, larger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This time, though, the takeaway is very different. It’s not bigotry that InXile is highlighting, but the flexibility of its character creation tools. Because at its core, Clockwork Revolution isn’t a first-person shooter, but a western RPG in the tradition of Wasteland, The Bard’s Tale and Planescape: Torment - all the games the studio has delivered successors to in the past. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the outset of a campaign, you can define your background as a Gearsmith who scavenged their way through life, or a Bookwarden who was saved from the orphanage by a wealthy sociologist. You’ll pick from traits with names like Street Stalker and Steam Whisperer, and distribute attribute points to determine your resistance to chemicals or flair for conversation. Your journeys back to the past will send ripples into the future, changing the nature of the city around you - a tantalising prospect for fans of RPG reactivity.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The over-the-top tone actually helps support the RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, despite initial appearances, Clockwork Revolution has less in common with Ken Levine’s opus than it does with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. Obsidian’s upcoming sequel, also featured in this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, is similarly focused on reactive worldbuilding and the many little custom quirks that make up a truly unique player character. As game director Brandon Adler explained during The Outer Worlds 2’s Direct, you’re cast in the role of an Earth Directorate agent - basically a sky marshal. But the game doesn’t lock down your character’s background or personality. You might have joined the Directorate to escape outstanding warrants for crimes you’ve committed. Or you may be a fraud, coasting on a deadly reputation you earned through an accidental killing. You can’t be a Gearsmith, but you can be a Roustabout who fails upwards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both games also share a Wizard-of-Oz quality to their art direction, with slightly garish palettes and over-ornate armour designs that look as if they could have been picked out by Jon M. Chu. They don’t scream to be taken terribly seriously - particularly not when, in Clockwork Revolution, a mechanical doll is screaming to “keep your filthy pickers off me”. In each case, that over-the-top tone actually helps support the granular RPG systems. It creates room for character decisions that don’t just conform to the greatest hits of the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a tangible example of that last point, take a look at Flaws in The Outer Worlds 2. If you take Bad Knees, you’ll move faster throughout the game - but your joints will pop every time you stand up from a crouch, signalling your position to nearby enemies. And if you’re a Kleptomaniac, your character will sometimes nab an item you’re looking at in a shop without warning - leaving you with the task of explaining yourself to the guards. Is that tradeoff worth the better prices you’ll get when selling loot? Only you can decide.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/13/the-outer-worlds-2-1749831262661.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Far from a grounded RPG party, The Outer Worlds 2's rag-tag crew will permit all sorts of oddball approaches. | Image credit: Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an unconventional power fantasy, you can choose to be Dumb in Obsidian’s RPG - allowing you not only to embarrass yourself in conversation, but to fix a computer by shoving a tin of hot dogs into the fuse box. This scope for wilfully idiotic decision-making is definitely reflected in Clockwork Revolution, too - as when, in the trailer, the protagonist repeatedly ignores an intimidating shopkeep named Uncle Alfie to talk to his underling Errol instead. A couple of unwise dialogue choices later, poor Errol is splattered across the floor, his head bashed in with a candlestick by his agitated employer. “Brains,” chuckles Alfie. “If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scenarios like these are laugh-out-loud surprising - rare in an RPG genre where character and conversation choices are often overfamiliar. More to the point, they simply wouldn’t belong in the more serious universes of Obsidian’s Avowed, or InXile’s Torment: Tides of Numenera. In other words, the absurdity of these settings is helping to keep the genre varied and fresh - and can perhaps even push it forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, zaniness is an acquired taste, and there’s a chance these games may overstep into tonal territory that becomes grating rather than gratifying. But the nature of choice-driven RPGs is that their most extreme aspects are optional. Nobody’s forcing you to wield the Spectrum Dance sabre, a musical sword in The Outer Worlds 2 that rewards you with damage bonuses if you can strike enemies on the beat. It’s your choice, and the tone of your experience can be tuned to your tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, I’m looking forward to building up a composite of my very own cockney criminal in Clockwork Revolution - with the help of a robot constable who gets suspicious as I pump points into Social skills. “Why do you think they’re so charismatic?” he asks, warily. “Are you sure this wasn’t a jilted lover?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jeremy Peel is a freelance journalist and friend to anyone who will look at photos of his dogs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-finally-has-a-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update finally has a release date: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPWdMDZWM4Y">17th June</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-because-it-simply-wasnt-built-that-way">We've known for some time</a> that Mojang was planning on a visual overhaul for Minecraft, and yesterday (14th June), the studio released a new video not only reminding us just what Vibrant Visuals brings to the game, improving "visual elements such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, and more", but also how the team achieved it.</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="MINECRAFT’S VISUAL REFRESH!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTOLOErWN4w?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<figcaption>MINECRAFT’S VISUAL REFRESH!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTOLOErWN4w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>And the new feature really does elevate the world of Minecraft. As the developer explains, "every biome has their own atmosphere", so warmer biomes will look more orange and yellowish, while cooler ones will take on a crisper blue appearance.</p>
<p>"This is a visual enhancement - there are no changes to Minecraft's gameplay," Mojang said. "For example, visual shadows will not impact light levels in a game-mechanics sense, or affect where hostile mobs spawn. Vibrant Visuals will be easy to access and approachable for many more Minecraft players, as it will be available on many platforms as a simple menu toggle."</p>
<p>"This is a start on this journey of modernising the look and feel of Minecraft," explained Vibrant Visuals Lead, Dejan Dimic. "So we look forward to hearing more feedback from the players."</p>
<p>Vibrant Visuals is coming to supported devices for those running Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and if your device can run it, you can expect the new feature to be on by default once it updates. It still isn't yet available for Java, but Mojang insists it's "actively working" on it.</p>

            <p>Another day, another Red Dead rumour, but this one comes from John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff.</p>
<p>In his latest Red Dead Redemption livestream, as spotted by F4D3broboi on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean/">Reddit</a>, Wiethoff was very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement. And while he was coy about the details, he did stress that he was particularly excited playing "<em>this</em> game" - the original Red Dead Redemption - and even suggested we'll know by this time next week.</p>

<p>"I've got such exciting news," he teased. "I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely <em>killing</em> me. By the end of this week, hopefully sooner, you're going to - not this week, I guess; probably not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday… Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share, and I won't be the only one sharing it.</p>
<p>"I cannot wait for you to know what's going on," he added. "And that's all I can say. And I'm not trying to be… I'm just telling, that's the only thing I can think about right now. And you will know soon enough. I can't wait for you to know, I am <em>so</em> excited, but I truly cannot think about anything else, especially playing <em>this</em> game, I can't think of anything else. Oh, then what I want to tell you <em>so</em> bad."</p>

<p>This latest tease comes just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>. YouTuber Nate the Hate stated the cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year.</p>
<p>The original Red Dead Redemption released way back in May 2010. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-review?page=3">We awarded it 8/10</a>, calling it "an exceptional Rockstar game, one that successfully re-clothes the Grand Theft Auto framework in an exciting, distinct and expertly realised scenario".

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with. Thus, we get the typical internet defensiveness that follows, and the most annoying person you know starts to nitpick everything you say as being too definitive and not acknowledging that plenty of other people might feel differently.  - Kenneth Shepard </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-preview-summer-game-fest-sgf-action-rpg-1851784440?_gl=1*1swiv1l*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crimson-desert-preview-summer-game-fest-sgf-action-rpg-1851784440?_gl=1*1swiv1l*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk4NDQwMzkkbzY0MCRnMSR0MTc0OTg0NTcxMCRqNTQkbDAkaDA.">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-recommend-id="image://c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-recommend-id="image://c0712c5bb4535653fe1b0654235ea0ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen with Varric behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With every new report about <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s troubled development, it feels like a miracle that the game came out at all.

We’re five years removed from its original announcement, and Capcom is no stranger to quietly hiding a game away and never releasing it (remember <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-caves-deep-down-capcom-1851364378"><em>Deep Down</em></a></span>?). So, I let the game disappear from my memory until its name showed up in my inbox. Perhaps it’s fitting then that <em>Pragmata </em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for <em>Pragmata </em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel.

		<p>Life is complicated. No matter how much you do to make your life as easy as possible there will be moments of loss. This can be through so many avenues such as the loss of innocence, the loss of family, the loss of a bond, or the loss of your own self. Dontnod’s 2020 title Tell Me Why explores the themes of loss along with acceptance, including the impact these have on our beliefs and relationships.</p>
<p><em>As is traditional through Pride Month every year, Dontnod and Xbox have made Tell Me Why free to download and keep, available across <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tell-me-why-chapters-1-3/9NF83PRZK6K3/0010/9MVX2Z790F69">Xbox, Xbox on PC</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1180660/Tell_Me_Why/">Steam</a>.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Tell Me Why Accolades Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vYrc29kve1U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tell Me Why tells the story of siblings Alyson and Tyler as they piece together the night of their mother’s death and navigate the circumstances after having been separated for a decade. The game also explores each character’s sense of identity and we come into their journey which has been going on for years for both. Tyler’s is about his self-identity and growing into a life of being a transgender man, while Alyson’s life has been one of avoiding facing the events of the fateful night.</p>
<p>Family means different things to different people. The most common is that family who you are related to and have grown up with, but others have a much broader definition where it can be the people you have chosen to be in your life as well. Regardless of who you count as your family, the loss of a family member is devastating. A lot of Tell Me Why’s story is told through replaying memories that Tyler and Alyson have of their mother – it is likely that you would do the same when someone you are close to dies, and it is also my own experience of losing a parent. While life moves on, you will be hit by those moments when you least expect them.</p>

<p>What Tell Me Why also touches on is the fallibility of memory, and how we all remember things in our own way. The way each of us remembers things impacts how we view our relationships. In Tell Me Why, Tyler remembers his mum as being against his trans identity, cold towards him, and angry, but Alyson remembers her as more of tragic character that was falling apart and was softly spoken. The unreliability of memory is a loss in itself, because we lose a true reflection of the experiences that shape us.</p>

<p>Relationship bonds are also a key part of Tell Me Why, with the twins attempting to reestablish their own bond, while Tyler is also looking at his ties with the people that were closest to his mother. One of those characters is Tessa, their mother’s former best friend and a devout Christian. What we learn from events is that she is struggling with accepting the LGBTQ community generally, and her relationship with Tyler who she has loved as a child. We can all-too-easily lose relationships that are important to us because other beliefs come in to override them, but even without dogma coming between us, the majority of people will have had relationships that simply peter out. It can be as simple as losing touch as people move on to new pastures.</p>
<p>Where there is loss, there can be acceptance. That does not necessarily mean what you are accepting is something positive, but that you’re taking the situation for what it is. Alyson and Tyler retread their past, dealing with the beliefs of those around them, learning about the events that have surrounded their childhood and dogged them ever since. Accepting a situation that does not meet your own expectations or beliefs can be viewed as a loss, but it can be a stepping stone.</p>

<p>The ending of Tell Me Why brings Alyson and Tyler to a place where they can truly start to heal and build their lives. Right now, there are a lot of groups that have been hit by loss as societal views and politics in many countries swing towards hostility against marginalised groups. We have seen the trans community increasingly shunned by the establishment, and this shift being celebrated, we have seen asylum seekers demonised for decades, and we have seen people from ethnic minority groups get attacked and abused due to misinformation. What has to be accepted is that hateful rhetoric and punching down is a form of winning for those that perpetuate it, and that those in charge are largely okay with this. Those of us who belong to groups on the receiving end have to accept that, because once we accept this loss we can regroup and push back. On the flip side, those who back or vote for those who push the hateful rhetoric and punching down have to accept the fact that even if they view themselves as good people, fundamentally they are not. You cannot be okay with alienating, discriminating, and attacking the smallest and most vulnerable groups in society and claim to be good.</p>
<p>Life is complicated. Sometimes you will have to accept a loss in life, take the bruising, to get to a place where you can heal and be stronger. Be like Alyson and Tyler, who suffer loss but in the end, depending on your choice, accept themselves for who they are and in turn help heal the wounds in their community making life better for all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stunning The Witcher 4 demo</a> shown during the State of Unreal presentation earlier this month, Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia had the unique opportunity to fly to Poland and meet CD Projekt RED (and Epic) to discuss what went into the demo and what kind of work the studio has ahead of itself for the full game.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy interview</a>, Charles Tremblay, VP of Technology at CD Projekt RED, revealed that the team switched to a console-first approach to development to achieve its ambitious goal of delivering an open world game with hardware ray tracing running at 60 frames per second on a Sony PlayStation 5 console. This will be easier than scaling down, which the studio had to do with their previous projects.</p>
<p><em>When we started the collaboration, we had super high ambitions for this project. We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down, but then we had so many problems in the past that we</em><br>
<em>tried to see, okay, this time around we really want to be more of a console first development. Then we worked with Unreal and we saw the challenge to realize the ambition that to make what we want, 60 fps on PS5, there would be work. This is why we started to talk, to figure out what needs to be done with the technology and we also decided, okay, we need to have all those things that need to be developed. Where we go from there, it's hard to say, but right now we really wanted to focus on what does it mean to make this ambition on a console. We&nbsp;really wanted to aim for 60 fps and not go back to 30 fps.</em></p>
<p><em>At this stage, we are perfectly aware that we still have a lot of work ahead of us. This is a tech demo, not the whole gameplay loop is implemented, there's no combat, there's a lot of things that don't work, but still, the ambition is set, so this is where we want to aim for The Witcher 4. It's too early to say if we manage to nail it, but we'll work as hard as we can to make it for sure.</em></p>
<p>The PS5 is not, however, the lowest of current-generation consoles when it comes to hardware performance. There's the Xbox Series S, and Tremblay admitted that the developers haven't begun to optimize The Witcher 4 for it yet, adding that it will be 'extremely challenging' to get it to run at 60 fps.</p>
<p><em>I wish we did a lot of work already on that, but we did not, so this is something that is next on our radar for sure. I will say that 60 FPS will definitely be extremely challenging on Xbox Series S. Let's just say that this is something that we need to figure out.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Epic considers software Lumen ray tracing to be a thing of the past due to several limitations, which is why the demo created for The Witcher 4 already implements hardware RT Lumen. CD Projekt RED, on the other hand, mentioned that they'll want to scale up for a high-end PC, although the form that scaling will take remains to be seen at this point.</p>
<p>The Witcher 4 will likely be <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2027 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Stay tuned to Wccftech for the latest rumors and reveals.</p>

<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33a1c78fb105b/jet-set-radio-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Hello folks, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>.</p>
<p>Before we get cracking, let's see how things panned out last time, hm? We looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_street_fighter_iv_3d_edition">Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition</a> for the 3DS. North America and Europe joined forces on this one, and together, they managed to bag an impressive 72% of the vote. Well done, indeed.</p>
<p>This week, we're back with the Dreamcast to check out <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/dreamcast/jet_set_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> (originally known as <strong>Jet Grind Radio</strong> in the US). Released in 2000, it went on to spawn a sequel and became one of the finest cult classics of the modern age, with an exceptional soundtrack to boot.</p>
<p>It's a full-on three-way brawl this week, so let's get to it!</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:159585,160025 @ 1750007924 -->
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/717ed2931d893/jet-set-radio-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All three cover designs showcase the main protagonist, Beat, front and centre. North America's approach is a little darker, overall, but the purple, red, and green work really well together.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14eb879dbb811/jet-set-radio-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe's design is a little bit lighter and brighter, potentially leaning into the overall theme of the Dreamcast itself. Beat's striking a pretty cool pose in this one, and we like that it makes the roller blade traversal obvious.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cc2e7c9b41465/jet-set-radio-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/30-jet-grind-radio">Sega / Launch Box</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Good lord, what's going on here? We love it! Very abstract. Beat is completely absent of any colour, and instead, the background is made up of lots of different graffiti images, with the main logo appearing just below Beat's spray can. So cool.</p>

<p>Get ready to "power-up" in Expeditions</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The free-to-play title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> has gone down quite well with LEGO and Fortnite fans, and Epic Games continues to enhance the experience with all sorts of new updates.</p>
<p>The latest reveal is a new teaser for <strong>LEGO Expeditions</strong>. Epic has released a trailer describing how players will suit up, squad up and power up next week on <strong>18th June</strong>, but beyond this, nothing else has been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Fans are convinced it's going to lead into an "expanded universe" or even a "multiverse" style offering. It will follow on from modes like <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-odyssey?lang=en-US">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@epic/lego-fortnite-brick-life">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>. When we find out more about this new mode, we'll let you know.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-3" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite originally made its debut on the Switch in 2023 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rocket_racing">Rocket Racing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a>, and is Epic's way of expanding the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a> universe. Epic also recently released a free Switch 2 version of Fortnite, and you can find out how LEGO Fortnite and the existing game modes run on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review</a>.</p>

<p>The famous Nintendo tune returns</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/281807c674aa4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo mentioned how there were all sorts of surprises to discover in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and a week after the game's launch it looks like Totaka's Song has been discovered.</p>
<p>As highlighted on social media and elsewhere online (via Nintendo Everything), you can hear Yoshi humming this Nintendo tune in the game's character menu. Here's a story and video shared over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/">Mario Kart subreddit by the user 'charizardtelephone'</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I was idling on the character select screen when I noticed Mario began humming after enough time passed. I thought, “Huh, they could totally hide hidden tunes like that.” Wait. Hidden music? In a Nintendo game? With Yoshi? It was too good to be true. But after a few seconds, lo and behold, yoshi begins humming Totaka’s song like the idle yoshis do in Mario Kart 8. Very cool Easter Egg. Not sure if anyone else has noticed it yet."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>When we tried this out ourselves, Yoshi started humming the same song just seconds later. It might also be a bit harder to hear depending on the music playing in the background.</p>
<p>This famous song by the Japanese Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka is often slipped into many of company's games. And if you're wondering why it's specifically Yoshi that hums this tune, it's because Totaka also happens to be Yoshi's voice actor, and once again voices the character in Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>This Easter Egg has also popped up previously in Mario Kart 8 along with series like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Zelda</a>, and was inserted into titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> back in the day.</p>

            <p>
I feel like money laundering is one of those concepts you see in a lot of crime TV shows but it's not really something that seems to come up much in games. I certainly can't think of any games that feature money laundering as an actual mechanic, but I'll be able to add one to the list next week: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game is getting a new update this coming June 17th called <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/513kao973a73ko/gta-online-money-fronts-coming-june-17">Money Fronts</a>, and is literally all about buying up small but generally lucrative businesses that you can sneak some money through.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a few businesses you'll be able to pick up but you'll be starting off with a classic: the car wash, specifically Hands On Car Wash. You'll get passive income through this from your criminal network, eventually allowing you to pick up the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, all of which will also bring in their own money from actual, legal business operations.
</p>
<p>
However, with the pro of lots of moola, there is a big con too. Operating these businesses this way will generate heat, and if that gets too high, you'll have to actually step in as the local business owner you're pretending to be to manage these companies the way they're legally meant to be.
</p>
<p>
There's a few new rides you can pick up too, like the Karin Everon RS or the Declasse Tampa GT (Muscle). Money Fronts is also bringing in some gameplay tweaks. More than 50 vehicles will have missile lock-on jammer capability, and all sources of arena points are being doubled. A number of cutscenes will be skippable on mission replays too, though which ones that'll be weren't specified.
</p>
<p>
More details will be coming, uh, at some point, Rockstar just said "stay tuned". You only have to wait a few days for it anyway, you'll live.

            <p>
I'm not much of an MMO person, I've dabbled over the years like with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> in my youth, and a bit of Final Fantasy 14. These days it's the level of commitment that puts me off, even though I really do love being able to partake in what feels like living, breathing worlds, the hustle and bustle of actual people going to and fro. Luckily, I think I have a lower-key way to get this kind of feeling in the upcoming action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> Starlight Re:Volver.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Right from the first second of Starlight Re:Volver you'll absolutely be thinking to yourself "oh, this is anime as hell." That'll be offputting to some, maybe, but it does so with such a ridiculous degree of finesse and style, I was won over right out the gate. The core gameplay loop is that you set out on runs with up to three of your friends, going through different rooms with waves of enemies across them, picking up abilities and buffs along the way.

<p>
It definitely seems like there's a Hades-like approach to the game, though the demo that's currently available for Steam Next Fest is more like an online playtest above all else. Right now I'd say there's a bit of an onboarding issue, as the game doesn't really do much to tell you much about anything, but with multiple characters to choose from all with unique playstyles, I had a fun enough time in the few runs I went through.
</p>
<p>
All of that can be smoothed over of course, I'm not that worried about that, so the real thing that's pulling me in so far is the vibes. The game's Steam page refers to itself as an "anime-inspired MMO universe", and the game's hub area certainly offers a slice of such a pie up.
</p>
<p>
There's an in-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suika-game">Suika Game</a> rip-off to play, a fishing mini-game, clothes to unlock, different areas to just hang out in. You can see different players running around too, and even if there's not much to do right now, it really does capture that specific feeling of being in a virtual place with a whole bunch of strangers.
</p>
<p>
How that may progress whenever the game comes out, I can't tell you, it's certainly something I hope to see expanded upon. In the meantime, you can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201010/Starlight_ReVolver/">here</a>, and you have until June 16th to try out the demo for yourself.

            <p>
It's a crossover episode! Like the great team-ups of the past (Scooby-Doo and Batman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/totally-accurate-battle-simulator">Totally Accurate Battle Simulator</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/landfall-games">Landfall</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-crabs-treasure">Another Crab's Treasure</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/aggro-crab">Aggro Crab</a> have come to make Peak. As in it's literally called Peak, not a qualitative descriptor that's been more widely adopted into Gen-Z slang that you have to Google because you're not a spring chicken anymore.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Peak is an aptly named game too, as it's all about climbing mountains. This being a game made by both Landfall and Aggro Crab, this obviously comes with a certain amount of silliness. Your virtual avatar is one that I can only describe as a "little guy", who you can apparently customise with different outfits and accessories. It's also playable in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, in fact that kind of seems to be the main selling point, but you can go solo too.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>our new game PEAK is a climbing game with friends where the slightest mistake can spell your doom🗻</p><p>reach the top of the mountain as a group of scouts when it drops JUNE 16‼️ <a href="https://t.co/5EADzD6gWd">pic.twitter.com/5EADzD6gWd</a></p></div>— AGGRO CRAB 💥 (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1933541312315236620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
The whole goal is to get to the top of the mountain (otherwise known as the peak of the mountain, if I need to spell it out for you), in hopes of being rescued after having crash landed on a mysterious island. There's four biomes to wade through, and along the way you'll have to pick up food to keep yourself going. You can get injured too, so unlike the example provided in the trailer above, you probably shouldn't punt your med kit off the side of a cliff.
</p>
<p>
Interestingly, a majority of the game was made within a one month game jam, so you shouldn't necessarily expect infinite content or whatever it is shareholders want these days. It just looks like a silly, goofy way to hang out with some friends for a few hours. It's also out really soon! June 16th to be precise, so you've only got a couple of days to wait. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">here</a>.

<p>In the interview above (skip to 28:12 for the segment concerned), Sony executive Yoshida Shuhei asked the developers about their design process.</p>
<p>"Our concept is always to do something that's 'not like anything else'. What I mean is, if Nier: Replicant had a boy as the main character, Nier: Automata would have a girl protagonist. If Western sci-fi is filled with Marine-like soldiers, we might go in the opposite direction and use Gothic Lolita outfits, for example," Taro said. "We tend to take the contrarian route."</p>
<p>"There are, of course, certain things that are ethically or morally inappropriate – even if they're just aspects of a character," Saito added, according to the subtitles. "We try to draw a line by establishing rules about what’s acceptable and what’s not.</p>
<p>"While certain things might be acceptable in Japan, they could become problematic in certain overseas regions, and even characters could become problematic as well. These are the kind of situation[s] we usually try to avoid creating. As a result, there are actually countries where we couldn't officially release Nier: Automata."</p>
<p>This immediately caused consternation with fans but as Automaton points out, this "could be a little tricky to translate, even for an advanced Japanese speaker".</p>
<p>When asked directly about the claim, Taro denied it, <a href="https://x.com/yokotaro/status/1933044002095575201">saying on X/Twitter:</a> "I've never heard of such a thing happening". Saito simply said he thought the things he'd mentioned had been mistranslated, and would clarify this in a future livestream.</p>
<p>In the same interview, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-says-former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida">Nier: Automata the "game that changed everything", as it was responsible for reviving the Japanese games industry</a> on its release. In a recent interview, Yoshida discussed how during the PS3 era, sales of Japanese games had declined, and increasingly studios there were chasing "overseas tastes".</p>
<p>That changed with NieR: Automata in 2017, released for the PS4. "I think Yoko Taro created it without paying any mind at all to making it sell overseas, but it was a tremendous success," Yoshida said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/sony-playstation">Sony</a> have been making a lot of mistakes over the past couple of years, including things like mistakenly thinking they could <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">release 12 live service games by 2026</a>, but the more immediately annoying one is its whole PSN thing. I probably don't need to remind you of that whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> fiasco, where they tried to make logging into a PSN a requirement for those on PC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">later scrapped this</a> because it went down horrendously. However, there has been one other snag that came with all this PSN nonsense: region locking.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Despite being able to play Helldivers 2 without a PSN account, it was still unavailable in almost 180 countries, all of which you can't make a PSN account in (it's still possible to play the game with an account connected, which will likely have factored into the reasoning behind region locking the game). This has applied to Sony's other PC ports of their PlayStation published games, except now, as shared by deals wizard Wario64, it seems a handful of them are now (mostly) region lock free.

Worth keeping in mind that these are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">all games that had their PSN requirements lifted earlier this year</a>. From what I can tell there haven't been any changes made to other PlayStation games based on their logs on SteamDB, but I'm also not entirely sure which games were and weren't region locked, so your mileage may vary with their wider portfolio.
</p>
<p>
It's a good move forward at least! Certainly seems like PlayStation are just shooting themselves in the foot by limiting where their games can actually be bought. Now the big question is whether or not their next big game (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-players-on-pc-wont-need-a-playstation-account-say-bungie">that isn't Marathon</a>) on PC will have a PSN requirement at all.
