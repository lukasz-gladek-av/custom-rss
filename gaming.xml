		<p>Having announced Onimusha: Way of the Sword back in December with a teaser trailer, Capcom has turned up for the State of Play stream with the first real trailer for the classic franchise revival, showcasing the game’s protagonist: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 1st Trailer: Protagonist | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9Ct29FeMak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is in development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and set for launch sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>The Onimusha series has lent on a blend of Japanese history blended with supernatural elements for its setting, built around third-person hack and slash combat for the gameplay, featuring its “Issen” counterattack mechanics.</p>
<p>Way of the Sword takes us to Kyoto in the Edo period where the relative peace of this period has been broken by &nbsp;the infestation by the demonic Genma, transforming it into na eerie and unsettling place. A long samurai with the Oni Gauntlet will have to step into the darkness and battle the hellish enemies.</p>

<p>Debuting on PS2 in 2001, the series flourished through the generation with a string of sequels, a tactics spin-off on GBA and a fighting game. The most recent main new entry was Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams in 2006, so Way of the Sword will mark two decades since that point. We did have a remaster of the original in 2018, though, and Capcom has also recently confirmed a remaster of Onimusha 2, coming out on 23rd May.</p>
<p><iframe title="Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny - Pre-Order Announcement Trailer&nbsp;| PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jZVwlMhAPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Games have come a long, long way since then – just see Capcom’s mastery of the remake and remaster in recent years – so it will be fascinating what parts of the original concept they retain, and what they update and overhaul.</p>

		<p>Supermassive’s space horror adventure, and the next game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> is set to launch on 2nd October this year. Just in time for the spooky season!</p>
<p><iframe title="Directive 8020 - Story Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4a_VXgNSfME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As an alien organism that seems to be able to mimic other life invades a colony ship, you’ll have to try to find any way to survive that you can. This is one small step and a giant leap forward for the franchise, switching things up with persistent real-time threats, new stealth mechanics, and enhanced interactive cinematics. It’s all powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King.</p>
<p>Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>

<p>“Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time. 12 light years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>
<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror </strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats </strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>
</ul>

		<p>The first new game from Sony’s State of Play broadcast was revealed as Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, a title that looks like it owes a lot to the rather good Team Sonic Racing as you will racing across the ground, air and water.&nbsp; On top of that, you also get to zip through space and time as well, maybe Sonic’s blue car is made of a TARDIS.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Announce Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/66UrGKXhJNI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Race across land, sea, air, space, and time in Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds! Warp through Travel Rings into new dimensions where something new awaits around every twist and turn. Speed to victory solo or as a team in a variety of offline and online modes and compete against players from around the world. Build the ultimate machine to match your racing style, unlock special skills to gain the upper hand, and unleash power-up items for the win!”</em></p>
<p>The trailer mentions a closed network test on February 21st, but the <a href="https://asia.sega.com/SonicRacingCrossWorlds/en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official site </a>does not have anyway to sign up just yet. </p>

<p>The game is coming to PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC and Switch, no mention of Switch 2 just yet.</p>

		<p>Sega shared a new trailer for their classic side-scrolling ninja series Shinobi. Shinobi: Art of Vengeance is coming out on 29th August for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ge__8Dan6bU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>After rumours that Joe Musashi might appear in Lizardcube’s last big retro revival, Streets of Rage 4, the team has instead been given control of the series return instead.</p>
<p>“Play as Joe Musashi in a new 2D action platformer that marks the return of the iconic SHINOBI franchise,” reads the trailer blurb. “Battle challenging enemies and epic bosses in a uniquely hand-drawn world.”</p>
<p>It’s looking pretty tasty. We’ll share more details when we have them.</p>

<p>Hell is Us developers have confirmed the September 4, 2025 release date at PlayStation’s State of Play event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogue Factor pulled up with a brand new trailer for Hell is Us along with the release date at PlayStation’s State of Play event. The release date trailer features glimpses of the game’s action and narrative sequences; check it out below. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Hell is Us - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2s_oHQYBoJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Hell is Us is an upcoming third-person, semi-open world action-adventure focusing on melee combat and exploration. The world you step into is very hostile and is filled with supernatural creatures that any of the modern weapons cannot defeat. However, you have a drone and a sword from a different age to help cut down these fierce chimaeras.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is known for its unique exploration system. Players are placed in a virtual world without conventional navigation tools. They cannot use a map, compass, or quest markers; instead, they rely on their instincts to get ahead. This freedom extends to the narrative portion of the game, where players can make their own decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the previous <a href="https://youtu.be/Q69e1A3ovxI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gameplay trailer</a>, Hell is Us developers revealed how players will use swords, spears, and axes against various game entities in melee battles while taking advantage of the drone’s capabilities. They also discussed different types of exploration mechanics, information trading, and other details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>’s release date has been announced. Are you excited about Hell is Us releasing this September?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>During the State of Play showcase, 1047 Games revealed that the first crossplay alpha test for Splitgate 2 is set to go live on February 27, running until March 2. It’ll be hosted across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S – but the team has stressed that the game will be released on last-gen consoles, too.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 was revealed in July 2024, emerging from the ashes of Splitgate, the ambitious portal-based FPS that was released in 2019 in early access. It wasn’t until September 2022 that Splitgate was fully released, but by that point, the player base had dwindled considerably.</p>



<p>1047 Games has evolved the Splitgate IP immeasurably in the last couple of years, and the follow-up title is looking <strong>sharp</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-generation">The Next Generation</h2>



<p>Splitgate 2, which can be compared to ‘Halo meets Portal’, is shaping up to be a special first-person shooter. This innovative title fuses traditional multiplayer modes and mechanics with portals, allowing players to dynamically deploy and utilise these ‘teleporting devices’ to alter the field of battle in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>It’s a high-octane concept that was delivered well in the first game, but owing to a lack of content and poor long-term player retention, Splitgate did ultimately flounder. </p>



<p>At the State of Play showcase, 1047 Games revealed that an alpha playtest for Splitgate 2 will run between February 27 and March 2, and players across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series platforms are invited to participate. This is the first crossplay test for the game, and it’ll feature a range of modes, weapons, and maps.</p>



<p>One of the biggest selling points of the alpha is an insane 24-player multiplayer mode made up of three teams of eight users.</p>



<p>Splitgate 2 doesn’t have a release date just yet, but stay tuned to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/">Insider Gaming</a> and we’ll let you know as soon as it’s confirmed.</p>

<p>Today (12) during the State of Play, the highly anticipated Lost Soul Aside received a new trailer and its release date was revealed. The game will be released on 30th May on PC and PS5.</p>

<iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0EKvNt4bijE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Developed by the Chinese studio Ultzero Games and part of the PlayStation China Hero Project, Lost Soul Aside’s journey has been quite long. Initially, the game was developed by just one developer, called Yang Bin.</p>



<p>However, the project ended up attracting the attention of Sony in 2016, which decided to support the game with financial, marketing and development assistance. Sony embraced the game so much that it decided to publish it, making it a second-party title.</p>



<p>What was a game made by just one person, has become an ambitious project that has a team of more than 40 people. The trailer makes clear the inspirations of the creator of Lost Soul Aside. Final Fantasy XV and Devil May Cry are huge influences, both in combat and in character design.</p>



<p>The synopsis reads as follows:</p>



<p>“<em>Lost Soul Aside follows the story of Kazer, a young swordsman who finds himself fused with a symbiotic supernatural race called Arena. The game is set in a war-torn fantasy world.</em>“</p>

According to Diablo general manager Rod Fergusson, we won't see the next major Diablo 4 expansion until 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking today at the DICE Summit in Las Vegas, Fergusson concluded his talk by discussing the team's plan to strengthen its relationship with its community by taking a leaf out of the books of both Diablo Immortal and World of Warcraft and releasing content roadmaps. He said that soon, we should expect to see a content roadmap for Diablo 4's 2025 plans, outlining seasons and updates at roughly the times they would show up throughout the year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, he said that the game's next expansion wouldn't be on that roadmap. It's not coming until 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In 2025, or just before Season 8, we will have a 2025 roadmap for Diablo 4. Now, our second expansion won't be on that roadmap, because our second expansion is coming in 2026, but at least players will have the road ahead."</p><div id="diablo-iv-classes-tier-list-overall-rating" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3><h3>Diablo IV Classes Tier List - Overall Rating</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fergusson did not go into much detail about why the second expansion had been pushed, but did offer some clues earlier in the talk. Previously, Blizzard had announced an intention <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-boss-mentions-annual-expansions-as-part-of-live-service">to release annual expansions</a>, with Vessel of Hatred in 2024 and presumably a follow-up expansion in 2025. However, as Fergusson described during the talk, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred">Vessel of Hatred</a> ended up releasing a bit later than they had intended: 18 months after the initial launch of the game rather than 12.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fergusson noted that this was because while the team generally works a season or two ahead of the current release, reacting to player feedback and necessary adjustments to live content resulted in resources being pulled temporarily from Vessel of Hatred, causing it to be delayed slightly internally from their original intentions and simultaneously pushing all other planned content back too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Diablo 4 just recently released its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-official-gameplay-trailer">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/diablo-4/Diablo_4_Season_of_Witchcraft_Release_Date_and_Details#:~:text=The%20Season%20of%20Witchcraft%20is,2025%20at%2010%3A00AM%20PST.">adds extensive new witchcraft powers</a>, a new questline, and more. We gave the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review">base game of Diablo 4 a 9/10</a>, calling it "a stunning sequel with near perfect endgame and progression design that makes it absolutely excruciating to put down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/lost-soul-aside-launches-may-30<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p>The wait is finally over. This is Yang Bing, as the creator of <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, I couldn’t be more excited to share some big news—our <a title="Genres > Action [2,476 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [16,983 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> will officially launch on PlayStation 5 and PC on May 30, 2025! What started as a one-person dream (me, a computer, and endless late nights) has evolved into a sprawling <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> full of breathtaking visuals and adrenaline-pumping combat.</p><p>Let me take you behind the scenes to explore the heart, soul, and sweat poured into this game. Whether you’re here for the stylish combat or the gripping story, there’s plenty to dive into. Let’s get started!</p><p><strong>A World That Lives and Breathes</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Creating the world of Lost Soul Aside was like painting with imagination on a sci-fi fantasy canvas. You’ll traverse landscapes that feel alive: sunlit plains, mysterious ancient ruins, and alternate dimensions that buzz with energy. This world isn’t just eye candy—it’s filled with secrets, monsters, and unpredictable events that keep you interested.</p><p>But let’s talk about what really defines the experience—combat.</p><p><strong>Combat That Packs a Punch</strong></p><p>My goal was simple: make combat so fluid, fast, and stylish that you never want to put the controller down. Kaser’s shape-shifting weapon adapts to your combat style. Are you a precise swordsman? A fan of devastating ranged attacks? Maybe you like high-speed mobility? Whatever your preference, the different type of weapons will serve you well.</p><p>One standout moment during development was designing the boss battles. The fight with a towering dragon remains one of my personal favorites. It challenges you to juggle aerial dodges, perfectly timed counters, and relentless strikes. Not to mention, it’s a visual feast that feels like being part of your own epic action movie.</p><p><a title="Games > Beneath [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/beneath">Beneath</a> the flashy moves, there’s depth for players who love to experiment. You can customize loadouts, chain synergistic combos, and strategize with Arena, Kaser’s dragon-like companion. His abilities aren’t just support—they’re game-changers, turning tough battles in your favor when used wisely.</p><p>From moment-to-moment clashes with enemies to massive set-piece battles, combat in <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> is designed to keep you on the edge of your seat, pushing your skills to the limit while rewarding creativity and precision.</p><p><strong>A Story Close to My Heart</strong></p><p>While combat takes center stage, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> also weaves in a narrative about Kaser’s journey of redemption and discovery. As he uncovers the truth about Arena and their shared power, players will encounter a mix of personal challenges and high-stakes conflicts. The story focuses on creating memorable moments and connections, offering surprises without overwhelming the gameplay experience. And yes, there’s plenty of drama, because who doesn’t love a good gasp-worthy moment?</p><p><strong>Made for <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,915 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a></strong></p><p><em>Lost Soul Aside</em> was built with PlayStation in mind, and I’m thrilled about the enhancements we’ve implemented:</p><ul><li><strong>Lightning-fast load times</strong> – With the PS5 SSD, you’ll transition seamlessly between exploration and combat.</li><li><strong>DualSense controller magic</strong> – Feel the tension of every blade swing with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback.</li><li><strong>4K eye candy</strong> – The world comes alive in stunning detail with dynamic lighting and meticulously crafted environments.</li></ul><p>PC players, don’t worry—the game is fully optimized to deliver smooth performance and retains all the core gameplay features.</p><p><strong>■ Pre-Order Bonuses and Deluxe Edition</strong></p><p>We’re excited to reveal the exclusive rewards for those who jump in early:</p><p><strong>Pre-Order Bonuses</strong></p><ul><li>Kaser’s original outfit from the game’s earliest reveal, giving players a nostalgic look back at how it all began.</li><li>A starter pack of in-game currency to help you kick off your adventure.</li><li>A bundle of healing potions, perfect for those challenging early game battles.</li></ul><p>Get your hands on the standard edition of <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> for $59.99 / £59.99/ €69.99/ ¥7,980 MSRP. There will also be a Digital Deluxe Edition of the game.</p><p>The Digital Deluxe edition of <em>Lost Soul Aside</em> ($69.99 / £69.99/ €79.99/ ¥8,980 MSRP) will include the game, all the preorder incentives, as well as Arena’s exclusive golden outfit, three unique weapon fragment skins, two in-game accessories that provide useful boosts for your journey, a Digital Soundtrack and Artbook.</p><p>Embark on an epic odyssey to save your sister and the whole of humankind from dimensional invaders in <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>—a stylish single player action adventure RPG.</p><p>Chain lightning-fast combos, learn new abilities, and upgrade your weapons as you take on formidable enemies and colossal bosses in fast, dynamic combat.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Lost Soul Aside looks like it's going to deliver some high-octane hacking and/or slashing when it launches this year on May 30, and the game got its time in the spotlight during the February PlayStation State of Play event.</p><p>The fast-paced trailer gave looks at the monsters invading the world, impressive traversal mechanics, and even giant Kaiju fights. The world is being invaded by monsters, which you will need to hack through, and--in some instances, as shown in the trailers--take down in intense one-on-one fights. Lost Soul Aside is blending sci-fi and fantasy, which the trailer shows off with a large variety of environments, from liminal dreamscapes to modern cities and even ancient ruins. The traversal shown uses some kind of nano bots to create platforms and wings.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EKvNt4bijE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0EKvNt4bijE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-ps5-and-pc-may-30/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the game will feature a large variety of weapons to use in its lightning-fast combat and will use the DualSense Haptic Triggers to add more feeling to every sword swing. The blog teases both close-range combat choices like swords, in addition to ranged bow options.</p><p>Developed by the Shanghai-based Ultizero Games, Lost Soul Aside was first announced back in 2022 and looks to blend fantasy and science-fiction elements with intense combat. We'll see if the studio has succeeded when it releases on PS5 and PC on May 30.

                <p>A new trailer for Sonic Racing CrossWorlds debuted during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">February Sony State of Play</a>. The fast-moving trailer showed off Sonic and his animal pals racing through a variety of recognizable Sonic locales, like Metal Harbor and Chao Park. And you may not have to wait long to feel the need for speed, as the trailer ended by announcing a closed network test coming on February 21.</p><p>The trailer showed more detail for the karts belonging to Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Shadow, and more. It also spent some time showing Sonic stunting while riding around on his kart and on a jet-board. It made a point to show the racers passing through rings that acted as portals, giving significance to the "CrossWorlds" name. It seems as if a typical race might actually cross through several iconic Sonic locations, as well as others like an aircraft carrier.</p><p>Sonic Racing CrossWorlds is coming to PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch this year.</p>

            <p>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - the swashbuckling new instalment in Sega's long-running crime saga - is getting a demo this week, ahead of the game's full release on 20th February.</p>
<p>The demo, which was announced during this evening's State of Play, will be available from 7am PT on 13th February. That's 3pm for those of us in the UK. For now, it is definitely coming to PS5 - I will check other platforms in just a second.</p>
<p>During this demo, players will be able to try out two fighting styles: Goro Majima's Sea Dog style and naval battles at the Pirate's Coliseum.</p>

<p>In addition to this news, we also have word of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> x Like a Dragon crossover, known as Ichiban's Holiday.</p>
<p>"Kasuga Ichiban, our beloved protagonist since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, decides to take a well-deserved break at the Blue Hole. Joined by his ever-reliable buddy, the bartender of the 'Survive Bar', this vacation is about to turn into anything but relaxing," reads a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/dave-the-diver-x-like-a-dragon-crossover-announced/">post on the PlayStation blog</a>. "Brace yourselves for an epic showdown as Bancho’s ego takes a serious hit when the bartender delivers a harsh dose of honesty about his skills.</p>
<p>"But wait, there's more! Our dynamic duo stumbles upon a sinister plot that’ll have you hooked. A dolphin-poaching syndicate is making waves, and it’s up to Ichiban and Dave to dive into action."</p>
<p>Dave the Diver: Ichiban's Holiday DLC will be available as paid content this April on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>
Capcom provided a fresh trailer for Onimusha: Way of the Sword at tonight's PlayStation State of Play, introducing new protagonist Miyamoto Musashi.
</p>
<p>
The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">first announced at The Game Awards last year</a> with a CGI story trailer, but this new trailer provided a first look at gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The game is set for release in 2026, but before that Capcom is releasing a remaster of PS2 classic Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny on 23rd May this year. That remaster was revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-spotlight-everything-announced-in-februarys-showcase">Capcom's Spotlight earlier this month</a>.
