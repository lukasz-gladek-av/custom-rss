Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

<p>
Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.

            <p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (or BAFTA, if you're after something a bit snappier) has announced the winners of this year's BAFTA Games Awards - and it's very much been <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>'s night, with the acclaimed PlayStation 5 platformer taking home the gong in five categories including Best Game.</p>
<p>Astro Bot's Best Game victory saw it win out over fellow nominees Balatro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and Thank Goodness You're Here. And it was equally successful in the BAFTA Games Awards' Animation, Audio Achievement, Family, and Game Design categories.</p>
<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot didn't entirely hog the limelight, however. Balatro, by developer LocalThunk, took the top spot in the Debut Game category, while Coal Supper's superb comedy oddity Thank Goodness You're Here was crowned Best British Game. Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' Helldivers 2 secured two gongs - winning out in BAFTA's multiplayer and Music categories - while Nomada Studio's Neva won Artistic Achievement, and Atlus' Metaphor: Metaphor: ReFantazio trumped fellow nominees for Narrative.

<p>But we're still not done! Surgent Studios' Tales of Kenzera: Zau won the Game Beyond Entertainment category, Ninja Theory's Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 came top in Technical Achievement, Vampire Survivors was deemed best Evolving Game, and The Chinese Room's oil rig horror Still Wakes the Deep was named best New Intellectual Property. Speaking of which, Alec Newman was victorious in the Performer in a Leading Role category for his portrayal of Cameron "Caz" McLeary in Still Wakes the Deep, while Karen Dunbar took the gong for best Performer in Supporting Role as Finlay in the game.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo has already shipped a supply of Switch 2 units to the US, months before the system goes on sale. That’s according to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">said on CNBC Monday</a> that Nintendo had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen portable gaming system “on a global basis,” and that many have already landed, including “some” in the United States.</p><p>“We really do hope we can meet that demand,” said Bowser. When asked if Nintendo can meet that demand, Bowser replied, “That remains to be seen. That certainly is our goal.” The original Switch remained hard to find for quite a while after it launched in the spring of 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17283938/nintendo-switch-earnings-fy-2017-2018-forecast">selling more consoles by April 2018</a> (17.79 million) than its predecessor, the Wii U, sold in five years (13.56 million).</p><p>Bowser told <em>The Verge</em> that Nintendo is “actively assessing” the impact of the latest tariffs, but that was before Nintendo decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delay Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> from the original April 9th date. Nintendo says it’s still on track to launch the console on June 5th. On Tuesday, analyst DFC Intelligence cut its Switch 2 forecast for the year from 17 million units to 15 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/switch-2-sales-forecast-is-cut-by-researcher-over-trump-tariffs"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. That prediction would still make it the fastest-selling console ever, despite tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">budget-stretching price of $449.99</a>.</p><p>The new tariffs announced after the Switch 2 event could be hard on Nintendo since the company is building Switch 2 in Vietnam, which is in line for a 46 percent tariff.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has been hellbent on jamming as many crossovers into the Call of Duty universe as possible these days. We’ve seen some bizarre topics surface, leading to inane in-game events and laughable skins that have players craving something a little more grounded.</p>



<p>In a recent claim from a prolific Call of Duty insider, it was suggested that Activision is acutely aware of the feedback from the wider community suggesting that Call of Duty is becoming a laughing stock because of these weird skins and irrelevant crossovers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness-is-key">Self-Awareness is Key</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1909627607567458504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a> gave feedback about the performance of Warzone and how Verdansk has boosted the game’s player count on all platforms.</p>



<p>He then turned to talk about the future of Warzone, suggesting that Activision’s teams are proposing taking a more restrained approach to skins and bundles in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They are talking about showing more restraint with Warzone for skins/bundles/microtransactions. Crossovers are ‘printing money’ but they hear the criticism that the game is starting to look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gone are the days when people ran around Call of Duty dressed exclusively in milsim outfits. The rise of the free-to-play battle royale platform meant that microtransactions had to be ramped up, thus leaving us with countless crossovers and collaborations with musicians, television shows, movies, and other games.</p>



<p>They might be ‘printing money’, but perhaps die-hard Call of Duty fans are growing tired of the number of neon-lit, over-the-top, impossible outfits in the game.</p>



<p>Have you ever bought a ludicrous Call of Duty skin? Let me know what you purchased in the comments, or hit up the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>We assembled data for those game baskets across 21 non-consecutive years, going back to 1982, then normalized the nominal prices to consistent February 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI calculator</a>. You can view all our data and sources <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1syr7IbqElHFNjEdWufjEO_ZZ6ep19WfjO512VDH4bxY/edit?usp=sharing">in this Google Sheet</a>.</p>
<h2>The bad old days</h2>
<p>In purely nominal terms, the $30 to $40 retailers routinely charged for game cartridges in the 1980s seems like a relative bargain. Looking at the inflation-adjusted data, though, it's easy to see how even an $80 game today would seem like a bargain to console gamers in the cartridge era.</p>

<p>New cartridge games in the 20th century routinely retailed for well over $100 in 2025 money, thanks to a combination of relatively high manufacturing costs and relatively low competition in the market. While you could often get older and/or used cartridges for much less than that in practice, must-have new games at the time often cost the equivalent of $140 or more in today's money.</p>

<p>Pricing took a while to calm down once CD-based consoles were introduced in the late '90s. By the beginning of the '00s, though, nominal top-end game pricing had fallen to about $50, and only rose back to $60 by the end of the decade. Adjusting for inflation, however, those early 21st century games were still demanding prices approaching $90 in 2025 dollars, well above the new $80 nominal price ceiling <em>Mario Kart World </em>is trying to establish.</p>

<p>In the 2010s, inflation started eating into the value of gaming's de facto $60 price ceiling, which remained remarkably consistent throughout the decade. Adjusted for inflation, the nominal average pricing we found for our game "baskets" in 2013, 2017, and 2020 ended up almost precisely equivalent to $80 in constant 2025 dollars.</p>
<h2>Is this just what things cost now?</h2>
<p>While the jump to an $80 price might seem sudden, the post-COVID jump in inflation makes it almost inevitable. After decades of annual inflation rates in the 2 to 3 percent range, the <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-">Consumer Price Index</a> jumped 4.7 percent in 2021 and a whopping 8 percent in 2022. In the years since, annual price increases still haven't gotten below the 3 percent level that was once seen as "high."</p>

			<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on the latest Nintendo Switch 2 market analysis from DFC Intelligence. The analysts reckon it'll become the fastest-selling console ever with 15 million units sold in 2025, although the impact of the tariffs, should they be here to stay, is impossible to fully predict.</p>
<p>When we received the report, we also got the opportunity to speak with founder, CEO, and principal David Cole to learn more about their insights on the Nintendo Switch 2 and the potential impact of the US tariffs on the whole games industry.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, David. Were you expecting that $450 price, or were you, maybe, like many other colleagues, waiting for Nintendo to announce a $400 price?</strong></p>
<p>We were concerned about the tariff issue before the announcements. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. They get parts from all over Asia that go into the system. With tariffs going into effect, we were concerned the price would be $500 or more, so when it came in at $450, we were actually pretty happy. $400 would obviously have been the best-case scenario, but we thought $450 was a solid market price.</p>
<p>Obviously, when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that they were going to put the pre-orders on hold, that's a whole new ball game. Clearly, this is an ongoing issue that I think everybody's trying to figure out. We met with Nintendo executives last week and they were confident in the pricing, but it's an economic environment that nobody can really predict. The decisions are made out of Japan on that pricing and it has to tie closely into what they feel they can lose.</p>
<p>Nintendo is a public company that's very much dependent on hardware sales to, if not generate a profit, at least not generate a loss. They're not like Microsoft, which has taken a big loss on hardware just to try and build an installed base. Nintendo doesn't tend to do that, so we are very concerned about the issue of, will they be forced to increase the price? Will they limit their manufacturing? Right now, they're cranking up the manufacturing and building up the inventory. They have quite a bunch of Nintendo Switch 2 inventory ready for launch, but going forward in the next few months, they may start to scale back on manufacturing a little bit.</p>
<p>There just may be another case of shortages, hopefully not as bad as what we saw with the<br>
PlayStation 5, but they may start to control inventory more, which would affect our topline forecasts because there would not be enough units to meet demand.</p>
<p><strong>That makes sense. It looks like they didn't factor in the tariffs for their initial Nintendo Switch 2 pricing. In your report, you're expecting a 20% price increase over the next couple of years. Were you referring to the Switch 2 or just generally across the industry?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're looking at prices on hardware, accessories, and software. Everything is set to increase and we've modeled that in our forecast. There will be declines in prices hopefully within the 2-year period. Obviously, it's a changing environment out there. The latest news I heard was that there would be a 90-day hold on these tariffs, but I think that's probably fake news. People are speculating every which way, which makes it very difficult to forecast accurately, knowing that it can really hit on two, with fewer products getting manufactured where they scale back on accessories.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have things like a camera and all kinds of different accessories. One of the first things they'll do is probably scale back on how much inventory is produced because they definitely don't want to build up inventory. You get a situation where the cost of manufacturing is higher and the cost of passing that on to the consumer is higher. You also have consumers knowing that this tariff price increase is probably temporary, so prices will hopefully come down. I'm going to wait a few months. Now that they've announced that $450 price, it's going to be tough to roll it back. That's a real catch-22 because I think if they were forced to increase the price and pass that on to consumers, a lot of consumers would look at it and say "Well, they announced the $450 price. They're increasing it because of the tariffs, but I'm just going to wait and wait till the prices roll back." It's a real catch-22.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if you think Microsoft might be forced to raise the price of the Xbox consoles. Of course, it's a US company, but the consoles are not actually manufactured in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. The impact is far-ranging and it's not just the video game industry, it's all consumer products, so you have this huge macroeconomic situation where prices are increasing across the board. The video game industry is definitely not isolated in this issue.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think that that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Indeed. You believe that the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially engage more directly with the PlayStation and Xbox fanbases compared to the original Switch, right?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We've done all kinds of research on that topic because what we've seen is really that the Switch had nice penetration among PlayStation and Xbox owners who are looking for a second system. If you bought a PlayStation, instead of buying an Xbox, you tend to buy a Switch. Even among the core PC gaming community, if you're a big PC gamer, you know a lot of those games you play are going to be available on the PlayStation and Xbox, but you go buy a Switch because the products that Nintendo puts out aren't available anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think what you see with the Nintendo Switch 2 is Nintendo really focusing on that audience with a lot of third-party content and features like mouse controls. It's pretty interesting how they're able to offer a unique platform that in many cases for these core users is a secondary platform, but could become more and more of a primary platform, especially now that you can get a lot of sports titles and more mature titles like Cyberpunk 2077. Then you have products from FromSoftware, which I thought was really interesting. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They're bringing Elden Ring to the Switch 2</a>, but they're also announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive title from From Software</a>, which was interesting because Sony has been investing and partnering heavily with From Software (they made an acquisition late last year to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest minority shareholder in From Software's parent company</a>). That's a pretty big feather in Nintendo's cap to have such an exclusive.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, they have that core Nintendo fanboy base that goes along with whatever Nintendo is putting out in most cases. I think that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up, more on the console side, not so much on the PC side, where you'd still see the Nintendo Switch 2 Switch as a secondary system.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago that they would bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The Nintendo Switch 2 seems a perfect fit for that, especially with the mouse-like controls.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It gives options to people who may want to play in different ways. Some people want to play with a controller and then you got a huge audience that loves to play with mouse controls. They're delivering more versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the new Nintendo console may eat more into the Xbox base or the PlayStation's?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the Xbox base is pretty weak right now, so I think it's going to eat more into Sony's PlayStation base. Microsoft's strategy remains unclear. They're focused on diversifying across platforms, they're looking at what kind of new hardware form factor to deliver. The PlayStation 5 is the really competing console platform right now out there. Whether that changes when Microsoft announces something new remains to be seen, but right now, it's really going directly after the PlayStation base.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is doubling down on the handheld capabilities. Just yesterday, Phil Spencer teased an Xbox handheld once again, and there have been rumors even of PlayStation considering another handheld. Do you think there is space in the market for new PlayStation and Xbox handhelds, or is it just getting saturated with the Steam Deck and other PC handhelds?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with Sony and Microsoft, with both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, was that they were basically just power upgrades. They were more powerful versions of what came before, and they didn't really shift the market dynamics, so I think both Sony and Microsoft are scrambling, knowing that this is an era where portable gaming is huge. They don't really have an option for that. Sony tried major efforts with the PSP and the PS Vita back in the day, but they just were not able to gain any market traction. Sony has clearly said the PlayStation 5 is on the downtail of its life cycle. They've missed forecasts the past two years and it did great at launch. Now, sales are not weak, but they're not as strong as Sony expected and they've come out and said it's clearly on the decline.</p>
<p>The question is, what answer will Sony and Microsoft have in terms of new hardware? Do they reinvent their systems to become more like a Switch with a portable option? Nintendo has had 30-plus years in portable gaming devices, while Sony's had some failed experiments. The track record is not strong for either of those companies. They need to try and come up with something, but whether they can, that's the open question right now.</p>
<p><strong>Returning to the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the big shocking points of the reveal was, of course, the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for Mario Kart World at $80 (€90 in Europe)</a>. Some people are still a bit shocked. Do you think it may be more of an exception than the rule?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it's going to be more of the exception rather than the rule. There's already quite a wide range of price points. Third-party titles are coming in and they're not going up to that price range. There's a lot of flexibility on pricing with types of software. Nintendo said that Mario Kart World has a huge amount of content and they think consumers are willing to pay $80 for it. Most people will probably buy the $500 bundle that includes the Switch 2 and the game, so that breaks the price down to $50.</p>
<p>The price will probably drive a lot of sales of that bundle. They're also doing a lot of these upgrade packs, which I think are a really interesting concept. They're going to use that whole upgrade model to enhance the existing games for the Switch, adding new features and then either sell it for $10 to $20 or give it away if you become an online subscriber, so there's just all kinds of flexibility in the business model.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the tariffs could even impact software pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Obviously, hardware has more of a direct impact, but you do have a lot of issues on the software side. Pricing could increase. Whether the publishers will eat that cost or not remains to be seen. I think it could show up in less discounting on products. One of the great things in the video game business is that you don't have to buy a game on day one; you could wait a while, and the price would come down. You might see an impact on that. I don't think it'll be as great as with hardware, but it definitely could have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Analysts from Media Research <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> that part of the reason Mario Kart World was priced at $80 was to drive users toward digital purchases, which are $10 cheaper. Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>It could be, but I really don't think so. One thing you have to consider when buying digital titles on Nintendo, especially when they're full games like Mario Kart, is it doesn't have a lot of onboard memory to store these games. Clearly, Nintendo is hoping to sell more of its proprietary memory cards. Digital buying on the Switch is growing, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily trying to drive that any more than would naturally be the case.</p>
<p>They probably realize that people who buy physical copies have a higher price tolerance than people who buy digital games. They want the physical part to decline as much as possible, but at the same time, having a physical presence is still great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Game Chat feature will be a major factor in the success of the Nintendo Switch 2? It seems like they're making a big thing out of it this time around.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We were talking to all our headset clients and saying, "You got to look at the Nintendo Switch 2 and putting headsets out for that because I think it is going to be pretty big." Having a younger audience, Nintendo has always been a little intimidated by chat and the can of worms that can potentially open. They've taken a slower approach to that, but I think it's clear with what they're doing with the Switch 2 that they're going all in on the chat.</p>
<p>I'm sure they are spending a lot of time ensuring that parental controls and all that good stuff make the chat system robust but also safe. When you're in that business, same with Roblox and other companies that target a younger audience, you have to be very careful in those areas, but the chat is a much-needed feature and I think it'll be extremely appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>The BAFTA Games Awards 2025 has wrapped, and all the trophies have been handed out. Sitting at the top of the table is Astro Bot, one of 2024’s most popular titles. It claimed no fewer than <strong>five </strong>BAFTA Awards, securing the winning spot in some of the most competitive categories, including the prestigious ‘Best Game’ slot.</p>



<p>It was joined by games like Helldivers 2 and Still Wakes the Deep, both of which landed multiple awards during the show.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-on-top">Astro Bot on Top</h2>



<p>Astro Bot has claimed the BAFTA Awards for some iconic categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Best Game</li>



<li>Game Design</li>



<li>Family</li>



<li>Audio Achievement</li>



<li>Animation</li>
</ul>



<p>The results at the <a href="https://www.bafta.org/awards/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA Games Awards</a> in London follow months of similar circumstances for Team Asobi’s wonderful platformer.</p>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep also had a nice spree at the BAFTAs, securing the following wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>New IP</li>



<li>Performer in a Leading Role</li>



<li>Performer in a Supporting Role</li>
</ul>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep was one of my top games of 2024, boasting some intense horror sequences that unfolded during a tense fight for survival aboard a besieged Scottish oil rig. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was able to grab the BAFTA Awards for Music and Multiplayer, while Hellblade II landed Technical Achievement. There’s a special nod reserved for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, which received the BAFTA Award for Game Beyond Entertainment, which given the game’s backstory, is deserved through and through.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Vampire Survivors won Evolving Game, an award that I thought would for sure go to Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. Balatro managed to secure the award for Debut Game, and Thank Goodness You’re Here, the star-studded and bizarre comedy title, won the award for British Game.]</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming, as I was at the BAFTA Games Awards and secured some exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in gaming.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-2025-roadmap-unveiled-%E2%80%93-new-expansion-in-2026.1158822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced the roadmap for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">Diablo IV</a>, as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/"> Age of Hatred</a> continues for the rest of the year, with the next big expansion for Diablo IV not coming until sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Diablo IV started 2025 with the current season, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which will come to an end later this month, with the Belial's Return season picking up the baton. Following that will be the Sins of the Horadrim season, and then closing out the year will be the Infernal Chaos season.</p>
<p>Each will bring a new set of limited updates that players can grab before they're gone, along with permanent additions to the game, like new lair bosses coming in the Belail's Return season, and new nightmare dungeon activities in the Sins of the Horadrim season.</p>
<p>The latter will also be when players on consoles will be able to plug in their keyboard and mouse setups, as support for that control scheme on consoles will arrive sometime this summer. There will also be new collaborations with other series in both the Belial's Return season and the Infernal Chaos season, and the former will likely feature a few special add-ons as Blizzard celebrates Diablo IV's two-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Of course, the new expansion that'll be coming in 2026 will be what brings the most change to the game when it arrives next year. The first major expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, arrived a little over a year after the game's original release. This new expansion is spreading that time difference further, so it'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they see how much bigger, or smaller, it is from the last one.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Diablo-IV-2025-Roadmap.png"></a></figure>

<p>For now, Blizzard teases that the new Diablo IV expansion will include leaderboards and a new ranking system. According to the roadmap image Blizzard showed off, that's about all we know about the expansion, which you can check out for yourself above.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound.1158819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em></a> went live. This tabletop adaptation of Arrowhead Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter was an instant success on Gamefound, reaching its funding goal 12 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/helldivers-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> brings the fight for managed democracy to gaming tables. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> videogame, it is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Players choose one of four classes, mission difficulty, and a planet on which to deploy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=2W4PN7Fq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-board-game-captain-miniature.jpg?itok=jLMAShhj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there, you and your squadmates must manage your ammunition, prioritize targets, strategically use action cards, utilize different weapon types and stratagems, and heroically extract from the mission area. According to the campaign page, a single game takes 120-180 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> includes many game pieces and elements that fans expect: damage dice, <em>Helldivers</em> miniatures, stratagem boards, and various status effect tokens. As for enemies, the base game only supports the insectoid Terminid enemies.</p>

<p>Thankfully, developer Steamforged Games included various expansions at different pledge levels and as add-ons. These include the Patriot Exosuit expansion, bringing mech power to the squad, and various boss enemies like the Bile Titan, Factory Strider, and Impaler. Finally, there is an Automatons expansion, bringing the robotic terrors of Malevelon Creek to the game.</p>

<p>There are three pledge levels for the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£61.00:</strong> The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Galactic Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£92.00:</strong> The base game, the Patriot Exosuit expansion, and two mystery expansions set to be announced at a later date.</li>
	<li><strong>Hell Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£246.00:</strong> The base game, Patriot Exosuit, Impaler, Bile Titan, Factory Strider, Automaton, and mystery expansions</li>
</ul><p>In addition, anyone who backs the crowdfunding campaign will receive a Gamefound exclusive <em>Helldivers</em> commemorative turn tracker coin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;£383,714, more than six times its initial funding goal of&nbsp;£60,000. The campaign concludes April 22.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> shared its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">roadmap for the game</a> across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as "part of the updated Lair Boss system."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an "IP collab." That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature "universes that complement its dark themes." Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab.
</p>
<p>
Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them "evolve in ways that are more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Hades 2's appearance in last week's Switch 2 Direct showcase</a>, developer Supergiant Games has confirmed the roguelike sequel will launch for the platform - as well as the original Switch - as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Supergiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-is-getting-a-sequel-the-princess-of-the-underworld-is-heading-our-way">announced a second Hades was in the works</a> at the tail-end of 2022, and it eventually entered PC early access in May last year. It's all change this time around too, with the original game's dashing protagonist Zagreus stepping aside so his sister - Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld - can take the spotlight as she embarks on a quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. With a little help from the Olympian Gods, of course.
</p>
<p>
Since entering PC early access, Supergiant has steadily expanded and refined <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, building on the formula that helped its predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">earn the title of Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2020</a>. And, now, following last week's confirmation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> release, the studio has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">appeared in the latest instalment of Nintendo's new Creator's Voice series</a> to introduce the game to a new audience and confirm - via a quick on-screen message toward the end of the video - that Hades 2's 1.0 release will come to Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive.

That announcement appeared to cause a little bit of confusion, however, and Supergiant <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909686305342328902">took to social media</a> shortly after to clear up a few details. "Hades 2 v1.0," it wrote, "will launch simultaneously on our Early Access platforms (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hades-ii">Epic Games Store</a>), Nintendo Switch 2, and the original Nintendo Switch." The only remaining question for now, then, is exactly when 1.0 will show up - but that's still TBA. All Supergiant has said so far is that early access will "continue during 2025", and that it doesn't have a specific end date "at this time".
</p>
<p>
The wait, though, should be worth it. Hades 2 was already looking special when it debuted last year, with Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it a "game I already love" in his early access review</a>. So expect good for its eventual launch on Switch and Switch 2.

The movie was happening in front of me on a big screen. I could see Jack Black and others dancing about in CG worlds, but the moment it left the screen and entered my eyeballs, it slipped back out of my brain. I had to force myself to absorb and comprehend what was happening. Luckily for me, not much actually happens in this bad movie.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is a (sort of) live-action adaptation of <em>Minecraft</em>. But how do you adapt a video game with no real story or characters into a 100-minute movie? The answer is to lazily make Minecraft another world that real human beings travel to and then eventually leave. Truly, the hallmark of any bad video game movie is when it can be summed up with “Yeah, it’s like that 1980s <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie with Dennis Hopper.”</p><p>But hey, I can stomach a lazy setup if the rest of the movie wins me over. And early on, things were looking good. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie contain some genuinely great jokes that made me and the rest of the theater laugh. We get to meet some of the characters, like the young, awkward Henry and his older sister, Natalie, who has become his mother-figure after their real mom died. The two of them end up in a small town in Idaho because it was their mom’s dying wish. Thanks, mom! As this happens, we are introduced to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031">Jason Momoa’s washed-up video game pro</a></span> who owns a game store and is a huge loser. </p><p>Also, Danielle Brooks is there as Dawn, a character who spends most of the movie doing nothing, saying little, and being wasted. After a fun introduction to the characters, including Jenifer Coolidge’s surprisingly horny and very funny side character Marlene, our four main heroes are zapped into the world of <em>Minecraft</em> and the movie collapses because Jack Black’s Steve becomes a part of the story.</p><p>Can one actor save a movie? Maybe. Can one actor ruin a movie? Yes. And that’s what Jack Black does in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. I’m not sure what the hell Jack Black is doing in this movie. I don’t mean why he was cast—he’s a funny, popular dude with a solid track record—but I mean, what is the idea behind his performance in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>? In fairness to Black, Steve is a nothing character in the game, just the name of its default skin. So he and the writers and director had to basically create Steve’s personality from the ground up. Yet, what they all decided to do was make Steve one of the most annoying characters ever to appear in a movie.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162">Jack Black is dialed up to 12 at all times in this film</a></span>. Every moment Black is on the screen, he is screaming, yelling, dancing, doing weird voices, or using slang. Sometimes, he’s doing all of that at once. It doesn’t work, and within 20 minutes or so of him being a part of the movie, the kids in my theater stopped laughing at his behavior. His performance in<em> A Minecraft Movie</em> is like someone doing an impersonation of Jack Black based entirely on a YouTube compilation of his “Wackiest Moments.” It’s not only annoying and tiring; it’s also not funny. It also makes it hard to connect with Steve, who is one of the main characters in this movie and one of the few with an actual character arc.</p><p>I almost left the movie early when, at one point, Jack Black, readying his newfound friends for battle, says: “We need to mine. We need to craft. <em>We need to Minecraft.</em>” Fuck off. I’ve only got so many hours in my life, and I don’t need them wasted.</p><p>As for what actually happens in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it’s got the most basic plot involving an evil person with no personality or interesting quirks who wants to destroy everything. But to do that, they need a shiny MacGuffin, and guess what? Our intrepid heroes need that same MacGuffin to get back home. Solving this conflict involves an hour of running and walking around CG worlds that look like <em>Minecraft </em>if you installed an ugly, realistic texture pack. Occasionally fights happen or conversations between characters occur, but the movie doesn’t linger on any one part long enough for you to care or develop any attachment to anything.</p><p>Technically, the CG in this movie is impressive. Real characters are perfectly integrated into the digital world. And when a <em>Minecraft </em>character leaves the video game world and enters the real world, he is seamlessly incorporated into the live-action sets. Good stuff. Too bad all the designs are hideous and don’t match up with the actual sound effects ripped from the game, which feel like the filmmakers attempting to remind you that, yes, this is still <em>Minecraft</em>. Promise.</p><figure id="" data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best part of this movie is a subplot involving Coolidge’s vice principal character, who is newly divorced and falls in love with one of the <em>Minecraft </em>villagers who leaves his world and enters our own. Every single time the movie cut away to show us more of that story, I was disappointed that I wasn’t watching a movie about them instead. It’s also heavily implied that she fucks the villager. Enjoy the movie, kids! (And enjoy that amazing voice cameo at the end. Seriously, I was stunned. Won’t spoil it here. But’s it perfect.)</p><p>Now, I know some will say I’m being too harsh. This is a movie for kids, after all. So what? I’ve seen plenty of good kids movies. <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> is one of the best DC movies ever made. It’s really funny, has strong character moments, a good plot, and doesn’t lazily dump Lego characters into the real world.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> just isn’t very good. Will kids like it? Sure, but generally kids also aren’t the most discerning audience, either, and that’s fine. I’m not saying kids can’t enjoy this movie. I’m just saying it’s a bad movie if you are an adult looking for something funny that doesn’t contain the worst Jack Black performance ever committed to celluloid. I’d recommend people go watch <em>School of Rock</em> and play <em>Minecraft</em> with some buddies instead of watching this crap. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that hardcore mode will come to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 next week. The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>

		<p>Poncle Games has announced that the PlayStation versions of Vampire Survivors will not have the cross-save feature due to a legal issue. This legal issue is that the cross-save feature on PlayStation would have required Poncle to share partner information, which is something the studio is saying it is unable to share. There is still a miniscule chance of cross-save coming further down the line, but this will require more discussion with PlayStation. The full statement is below.</p>

<p><em>“We’re sorry to say won’t be able to bring the Vampire Survivors Cross-Save feature to PlayStation 4/5 alongside our next update. Last month, we told everyone that Cross-Save would be available on PlayStation 4/5, PC, Xbox, Android and iOS alongside our next free VS update in April. But at last minute, we’ve run into a legal issue on PlayStation we weren’t aware of that requires us to share info on our partners that we’re unable to. The chances of Cross-Save coming to PlayStation consoles are now very slim, but not impossible, so we’re going to keep working alongside PlayStation to resolve these problems. We’re so sorry to build up any anticipation for this feature on PlayStation only to change plans at the last minute Cross-Save will still be available on PC, Xbox, Android and iOS in the next few weeks, with Nintendo Switch following at a later date (+ Apple Arcade if we can do so without breaching any privacy commitments).&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>PS: for anyone wanting Cross-Save just to unlock trophies, it’s worth noting that PS Trophies are automatically disabled on a platform level for all games when using a save file from another platform”</em></p>

<p>The cross-save feature will still be coming to PC, Xbox, Android, and iOS in the next game update. It will also be available on Switch later on down the line too.</p>

            <p>
It's another week, and with that comes word of the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> update. The patch isn't ready quite yet, but in a new <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-apr-8/">update check-in</a> post, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/firaxis-games">Firaxis</a> shared that the game's next update is coming April 22nd, just a couple of weeks away. There's a few big changes coming too, so how about we just jump right in. First up is a change to resources. There'll be ten new resources coming to the game, all of which will get their own new narrative events for starters.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Resources will now crop up differently thanks to a "newly added randomized resource generation system." You'll still get key resources in every age, but past that there'll be a wider variety available on the map. Certain resources will also now only be findable on certain continents or hemispheres, with Firaxis hoping that this "gives your maps a little bit more personality and motivation to explore." Treasure resources will also be getting passive effects too.
</p>
<p>
Then there's the changes coming to food. A lot of Civvers (that's what I call Civilization players, I think it's gonna catch on) apparently found that rural population and food wasn't really worth investing in past a certain point, so Firaxis is making some tweaks to make population growth scale "much more smoothly across your campaign, even deep into later Ages. And, growing beyond 8 or 9 rural Population is now very achievable; doing so won’t take hundreds of turns."
</p>
<p>
This update introduces an endless play mode too, so you can keep going with your campaign once you've finished the modern age thanks to a new Just One More Turn option. There's a returning feature from previous Civ games too, Teams Multiplayer, and a bunch of other additions like a repair all option, less natural disasters, and overall quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
Firaxis also took the time to assure us all by promising that previously mentioned features like auto-explore and new map types are still in the works too, they just won't be in this update. In the meantime, just keep Civving (that's a new verb I just made for when you're playing Civilization, I think it's gonna catch on) it up!

                <p>Nitrome, the developer behind Shovel Knight Dig, has announced a new game called Mouse Work. It is exclusively built around the use of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/" data-ref-id="1100-6530529">Nintendo Switch 2's mouse controls</a>.</p><p>Mouse Work really embraces the "mouse" idea. It's a party game in which players use Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to control mice and complete minigames. We see a few of these minigames in action in its debut trailer, such as ones where players pick up and stack boxes, paint the lines that appear on a canvas, close annoying pop-up ads on a PC desktop, shoot asteroids in space, guide rock climbers up a wall, and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Mouse Work, each of these minigames is billed as a job that players must complete to earn Cheddar, the game's in-game currency. Players can then use Cheddar to buy new cosmetics for the mouse cursors that players control. The official description reveals that the whole game can be played in either solo or co-op. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> is the title that most immediately comes to mind as a comparable game.</p><p>Mouse Work is notable for being the first built-for-Switch-2 indie game announced in the wake of the system's reveal last week. It fills the same niche as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut It Out Together!</a> as a kid-friendly, cooperative launch window game where players can get a grip on one of the Nintendo system's core hardware concepts. Where Snipperclips emphasized easy cooperative play, Mouse Work takes advantage of the mouse capabilities of the Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p><p>Nitrome has yet to confirm a release date for Mouse Work, simply saying that it "will release hot on the tail of the Nintendo Switch 2." The new system will come out on June 5 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch lineup</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and more.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> 11.1.5 update is landing April 22, and with it new features like a boss rush mode and the return of Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions. However, what players are perhaps most excited about is that the update will finally bake in a UI alternative to one of the game's most popular (and, in the opinion of many WoW players, required) add-ons.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24186695/patch-1115-arrives-on-april-22" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, patch 11.1.5 will officially add the Cooldown Manager to the game's customizable UI, giving players far more control over tracking their character's various abilities and buffs. Players will be able to better track their utility cooldowns with a special bar, see easy-to-read meters showing the time remaining on buffs, and more easily watch out for the essential abilities coming off cooldown. It's something the game's default UI has been sorely missing for quite some time, resulting in players turning to free third-party add-ons to meet their needs, specifically an add-on called WeakAuras.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The 11.1.5 Content Update goes live April 22!<br>🕷️ Nightfall campaign<br>📊 Cooldown Manager UI Update<br>✨ Winds of Mysterious Fortune Leveling Event<br>🔮 Horrific Visions Revisited - May 20<br>⚔️ Dastardly Duos Event - June 3 <a href="https://t.co/HTgj7RHHbo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HTgj7RHHbo</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While the Cooldown Manager won't offer quite as much granular customization as WeakAuras (which can get very complex), it does offer much of the basic functionality and benefits of the add-on, minus all the hassle. It's not the first time Blizzard has sought to improve its UI and make it so add-ons feel like less of a requirement. As part of the game's Dragonflight expansion, Blizzard dramatically overhauled the MMORPG's UI and introduced far more customization to it than ever before, significantly reducing the need for players to install popular UI add-ons like Bartender. Over time, Blizzard has continued to update the UI to make it far more usable right out of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt many players will still use WeakAuras due to how highly customizable it is, but for players who are more casual and don't feel like spending hours setting up WeakAuras for each of their characters, the default Cooldown Manager will be a great alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">As for actual content coming as part of 11.1.5, things will kick off on April 22 with a new scenario and quests revolving around the Flame's Radiance, a new Renown faction that will see players defending Hallowfall from invading Sureki forces. In addition to new cosmetics and a tabard that will change visually as players rise through the Renown ranks, players will also unlock buffs that will make them stronger while in Hallowfall and Azj-Kahet. A leveling event that will grant 20% more XP, as well as a hefty Renown reputation buff for Dragonflight and The War Within factions, will also begin April 22.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions feature will return on May 20, allowing players to once again battle through Old God corrupted versions of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to earn not only up to Heroic level gear but also new cosmetics and enchants. Then on June 3, Blizzard will introduce a new feature called Dastardly Duos, a boss rush-style mode that will see players battling against two or more bosses from the game's past at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW's 11.1 update, Undermine(d)</a>, released February 21 and saw players travel to the fabled goblin city, though the Race to World First to clear the Mythic difficulty of the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-exploiters-cleared-new-mythic-raid-first-using-grey-items-got-banned-and-then-did-it-again/1100-6530118/" data-ref-id="1100-6530118">Liberation of Undermine raid was disrupted by a group of exploiters</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear</a>'s grim and competent special ops protagonist Solid Snake was only grim and quiet thanks to strict tech limitations restricting what his creator, Hideo Kojima, could do with him. Kojima made the comments in a recent interview with Japanese magazine An-An (which <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton </a>translated) and said the severe hardware restrictions of the MSX2, which Metal Gear first released on, meant he couldn't get too ambitious with his new creation's emotional profile.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was 1986 when I entered the game industry," Kojima said. "Games still couldn’t speak. Characters did not have voices. Kanji fonts weren’t supported, and you could only show one katakana character at a time. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut title Metal Gear (1987), was born as a silent ‘tough guy’ because of these circumstances."</p><p dir="ltr">Those circumstances had changed by the time Kojima and Konami developed Metal Gear Solid in 1998, when Snake had a voice actor and more things to say. However, by that point, Kojima had made Solid Snake's stoic gruffness part of the character's personality. He said he envisioned Snake as a character similar to James Bond or Lupin the Third, delivering "snappy lines" when the situation called for them. Kojima also said he attributed much of the character's popularity to David Hayter's voice work in the English version and Akio Otsuka's in the Japanese release.</p><p dir="ltr">Hayter reprised his role as Solid Snake (and sometimes Big Boss) in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, along with a few spin-offs. While his personality remained largely the same, Konami experimented with a more involved role for Snake over the years, with Snake being rather chatty in some games and unusually reticent in others, such as Metal Gear Solid V. However, Kiefer Sutherland voiced Solid Snake in that game.</p><p dir="ltr">His personality in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake won't change, though--at least in the main campaign. Konami confirmed that the studio is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-using Metal Gear Solid 3's original voice track</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid 3: Delta</a>. Hayter, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gears-david-hayter-seemingly-teasing-new-performance-as-snake/1100-6526906/" data-ref-id="1100-6526906">teased new voice work in October 2024</a>, though whether it's for a new Metal Gear game or some sneaky new additions to Metal Gear Solid 3 is anyone's guess.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch.1158687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hades-2-will-be-a-nintendo-switch-and-switch-2-console-exclusive-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Even though it's been in early access for almost a year now, at time of writing, the full release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-second-update-tweaks-major-core-combat-mechanics/">Hades 2</a>, set to arrive sometime later this year, is easily one of the most anticipated releases for 2025.</p>
<p>However, just like the launch of the original Hades, players on Xbox and PlayStation consoles will have to wait to play the full release. During a Creator's Voice video from Nintendo published on Tuesday, Supergiant Games confirmed that Hades 2 will be a Nintendo console-exclusive game at launch.</p>
<p>That means when it arrives at the still unannounced release date, it'll be available on PC, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2. If you don't have any of those devices and only play on a PlayStation or Xbox console, you'll have to wait a little longer to check out the full release of Hades 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hades 2 was one of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/">third-party games confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2</a> during the Nintendo Switch 2 direct last week, though it was not confirmed to be one of the launch titles for the console, as we're still without a release date for the full game.</p>
<p>It arrived on PC in early access on May 6, 2024, and at the time of writing, that one-year anniversary is less than a month away. It wouldn't be the biggest surprise if we didn't have to wait too much longer to hear more about when the 1.0 version of Hades 2 is ready to release.</p>
<p>The original Hades spent almost two years in early access, and while it's entirely plausible the same could happen here, all signs point to Hades 2 being ready for its full launch far ahead of that timeline.</p>
<p>Hades 2 is the first sequel Supergiant Games has ever done, with each of its previous projects being one-and-done titles that have all added to its mythical status as an indie developer that simply does not miss. Early access players are already loving Hades 2 and can't wait for the full release. It is almost surely a lock for one of the games that'll be a part of 2025's Game of the Year conversation.</p>
