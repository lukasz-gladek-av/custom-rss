            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned game designer Hideaki Itsuno famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left CAPCOM</a> around a year ago after a thirty-year career at the Japanese company. A couple of months later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-creator-hideaki-itsuno-joins-tencents-lightspeed-to-work-on-aaa-action-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that he would become the head of a new Japan-based team at Tencent subsidiary LightSpeed Studios, which would create action games, per his expertise.</p>



<p>Now, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-veteran-itsuno-hires-devil-may-cry-street-fighter-royalty-for-new-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported by VideoGamesChronicle</a>, LightSpeed has announced new milestones for the studio: the hiring of several key developers from CAPCOM and the opening of a new office in Osaka (Japanese developers will be able to choose whether they'd like to keep working from the Tokyo office or move to the new one, <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1960146677844861325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the official X account</a>).</p>



<p>As for the new hires, they're all former colleagues of Hideaki Itsuno:</p>



<ul>
<li>Writer Toshihiro Nakagawa, also known as Bingo Morihashi, has worked on Devil May Cry 2, 3, 4, 5, and both Dragon's Dogma games</li>



<li>Daigo Ikeno, an artist whose works include Street Fighter, Devil May Cry, and Dragon's Dogma</li>



<li>Gouda Cheese/Bengus(both fictional names), another artist who has worked on Street Fighter and Power Stone</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Actually, the new LightSpeed Japan Studio has roughly a third of its employees (around 40 in total for now) who came from CAPCOM, and Hideaki Itsuno highlighted the benefits of this choice in a statement shared with VGC: </p>



<p><em>Although we’re a new studio working on a new game, it’s good to be able to work with people who I trust like Mr. Nakagawa. I have been working with him for decades, since Devil May Cry 2, and he’s one of those core members who understands me very well. Ikeno-san is also participating as an art director this time, and Bengus-san has a very high level of understanding and is a very unique man – he was a legendary designer at Capcom.</em></p>



<p><em>It’s all about a sense of trust… we know exactly what each of us want. And it’s not just these three people: I also hired some other people I worked with from before at Capcom, so even though this is a new studio, I’ve gathered those people who I trust to make sure that this is going to be a successful game.</em></p>



<p>Hideaki Itsuno and his team are working on an original IP. Earlier today, Itsuno-san <a href="https://x.com/tomqe/status/1960151714423865732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said on X</a> that the team will work on a prototype that will 'delight players around the world', though they are still seeking creative directors. As such, it would be wise to expect a long wait before we hear concrete details on the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2-was-%E2%80%98saved%E2%80%99-by-a-team-of-five-developers-%E2%80%98we-weren%E2%80%99t-supposed-to-exist%E2%80%99.1280397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft recently appeared at Gamescom to present the future of The Division 2, including the unveiling of ‘a big project’ that turned out to be The Division 2: Survivors. As the game approaches its tenth anniversary, more content has been lined up, but for a while, things looked a little sketchy for Ubisoft’s once-iconic third-person shooter MMO.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Palle Hoffstein, art producer at Massive Entertainment, revealed that a micro-sized team stumped up the courage to ‘resurrect’ The Division 2 when it was in a slump, and the turnaround was something incredible.</p>



<h2 id="h-something-bigger-and-lasting">‘Something Bigger and Lasting’</h2>



<p>Ubisoft posted a timeline to social media on August 22, unveiling the immediate and long-term future of The Division franchise, including the string of expansions coming to The Division 2. The team also discussed The Division: Resurgence, an all-new mobile experience set at the heart of The Division’s <em>borderline </em>post-apocalyptic universe.</p>



<p>In a line of comments responding to that post, art producer <a href="https://x.com/Palle_Hoffstein/status/1959275482462953660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Palle Hoffstein revealed</a> how The Division 2 almost slipped out of reach, but a dedicated team of just <strong>five developers </strong>clawed it back from the abyss:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We had 5 people to restart Division 2. Five! What were we thinking? Ah that was fun.</em></p>



<p>When a few of us made a small team to resurrect TD2 I had zero interest in adding a year or two, just to sunset the game again. The goal, what we believed we could do, was to <strong>build something bigger and lasting</strong>. This is fun to see but there’s still so much more we want to do.</p>



<p>I figured the biggest challenge would be staffing and yeah. Studios plan staffing years in advance to keep everyone allocated and busy. We created a problem of being a team that needed positions filled that weren’t on anyone’s spreadsheet. <strong>We weren’t supposed to exist.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p><em><span>(</span>Thanks to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ubisoft-allocated-5-devs-restart-the-division-2-build-something-bigger-lasting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The Division debuted in 2016 and turned heads thanks to a solid marketing campaign and a great launch that plunged players into a desperate fight to reclaim New York from looters, shooters, and organized criminals. The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has become a staple of Ubisoft’s live-service lineup, even if things went wavy for a while.</p>



<p>Palle later revealed that when a 2024 crossover event that introduced Resident Evil to The Division aired, he might have been ‘the last person’ on the D2 team:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I might have been the last person actually on the D2 team, to launch the Resident Evil stuff. We were done. Then a few weeks later I was asked if I could do another apparel event for D2. Despite having no artists I said, “sure.” I assumed I could figure something out lol.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Are you glad that this team of five developers got their heads down to ‘save’ The Division 2? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

        <p>Humanity is approaching its end.</p><p>In a world steeped in despair and chaos, a strange religious organization called Shuten Order emerges, yearning for the end of humanity. The group rapidly gains followers, eventually forming a small nation state called Shuten.</p><p>Tragedy strikes during the grand festival celebrating their nation’s founding—the leader of the Shuten Order is murdered. Soon after, the protagonist awakens with no memory, greeted by two self-proclaimed “angels”. They reveal a shocking truth: the protagonist is the murdered Founder, revived by divine power. However, the resurrection is incomplete—their memories are gone, and their life limited to a mere four days.</p><p>To survive, the protagonist must overcome “God’s trial”: identify and kill their murderer.</p><p>With the clock ticking, the protagonist, given the alias Rei, dives into the tumultuous city as a detective. The suspects? Five ministers of the Shuten Order. There’s no time to investigate them all. Choices must be made, and the pursuit of truth demands sacrifice.</p><p>Who killed the Founder?

<p>Ahead of Tokyo Game Show (TGS) 2025 in September, PlayStation has announced its lineup for the expo. The convention, held yearly, has already shown promise this year with contributors like Capcom and Koei Tecmo showing up with huge games. Now, PlayStation has joined in on the fun with two of its biggest upcoming titles.</p>



<p>This is the company’s second year in a row showing up to TGS after being absent from 2020-2023.  Last year, the biggest games were Monster Hunter Wilds and the GOTY winner Astro Bot. Death Stranding 2: On The Beach also held a showcase, where a new trailer was unveiled. While no showcases are revealed just yet, the two titles on display are sure to make fans happy.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As of right now, only two brand-new titles will be available for attendees to play on the show floor. Those titles, according to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/sony-interactive-entertainment-announces-preliminary-tgs-2025-lineup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the press release</a>, are Sucker Punch’s Ghost of Yotei and ARC System Works’ Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls. More games will be announced closer to the expo’s start on September 25th, 2025. </p>



<p>This marks the first public demo of Ghost of Yotei, which launches a week after TGS on October 2nd. Meanwhile, many fans at EVO got their hands on Marvel TOKON: Fighting Souls, with many more when the closed beta comes on September 6th. Still, both games are some of the studio’s and are sure to make a splash with attendees.</p>

<p>Following an announcement earlier this month, Nintendo's free Switch eShop and smart device application <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> is now available to download.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/action_tps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam TPS Fest</a>, the multiplayer 5v5 shooter Last Flag released a surprise demo today. The fest, which celebrates Third-Person games with sales and demos, started today. While many demos were already available, like Star Wars Outlaws, Last Flag is one title nobody expected to see. </p>



<p>Last Flag, scheduled for 2026 for Steam (with console versions in the works), is a 5v5 multiplayer shooter by Night Street Games based on the infamous Capture the Flag mode. With a unique 70s art style and fun gameplay, it definitely stands out from other titles like Call of Duty and Battlefield. Therefore, the surprise release of a limited-time demo is sure to get some attention, especially after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s success</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-last-flag-s-free-demo-lasts-from-august-25th-to-september-1st">Last Flag’s Free Demo Lasts from August 25th to September 1st</h2>







<p>As per a press release, a free demo for Last Flag is available now on Steam for players to try. The demo will only be up for a week, ending September 1st. To get the demo, head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a> and download the demo. </p>



<p>With multiple characters to choose from, with a wide range of abilities, you’ll work together with your team to hide the flag and capture it. In addition, music for the game has been worked on by Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons), Grammy-nominated producer/writer JT Daly (Benson Boone), and Dave Lowmiller (Call of Duty: Modern Warfare). It seems like the perfect mix for players to create an unforgettable experience on and off the battleground.</p>



<p>Do you plan on playing Last Flag this week? If you have, how are you liking it? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rpg-designer-goes-missing-after-crowdfunding-award-winning-game.1280304/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The perils of backing a crowdfunded game <a href="https://rpggeek.com/geeklist/160421/controversial-or-fraudulent-kickstarters?itemid=7809913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are nothing new</a>; a successfully-financed campaign failing to deliver is hardly an outlier, and is often down to the team behind it being inexperienced. In the case of the RPG <em>Grimwild</em>, however, the lack of a delivered project is for potentially more serious reasons.</p><p>The tabletop RPG, which<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> was originally supported in 2024 on crowdfunding site BackerKit by 590 people for $40,000</a> (before<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild-hardcover-reprint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a later hardcover version was backed by 597 for a further $47,000</a>), promised a "cinematic narrative rules system" which eschewed the finer points of rules in favour of a game that was more "concerned with the dramatic over the realistic". After a few updates to the rules and some production delays, both physical editions of the rulebook<a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/OddityPress/grimwild/updates/21610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> were supposed to be delivered to customers in July</a>.</p><p>That window has obviously come and gone, with no books delivered. In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1meaho5/grimwild_designer_missing/?share_id=rCU9CP0TaWK4YjRZMMkjd&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update</a> delivered to backers on the game's community Discord server last month, a moderator explained why, revealing that nobody involved with the book's production had been able to get in touch with Grimwild's designer, J.D. Maxwell, for weeks.</p><p>"As many of you have noticed, Max has been absent for nearly two months", the statement says. "Initially, we weren’t too worried. We knew he needed a break. Launching a successful crowdfunding campaign and a project like this is as rewarding as it is exhausting, and Max had also been going through some real-life changes that we hoped he was taking time to adjust to and enjoy."</p><p>Maxwell's colleagues on the game's design and production, Per Janke and Luke Saunders, have been "doing everything they can to reach Max or at least someone who can confirm he’s okay", and acknowledge that they "understand how confusing, frustrating, and even worrying this situation is".</p><p>A crowdfunded game designer cutting off all contact after getting their money would normally be cause for concern among the backer community, sparking fears the game would never be completed. In this case, however, things are different; not only is the game finished and the manufacturing costs reportedly already paid for--fans have been able to play a downloadable edition of <em>Grimwild </em>for months now, it's only the physical book deliveries that are being held up--<a href="https://ennie-awards.com/2025-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but just a few weeks ago both Maxwell and <em>Grimwild</em>'s free pdf version were nominated for, and won, an award at the Ennies</a>.</p><p>Yet physical deliveries have been unable to proceed because the manufacturing accounts are in Maxwell's name, while Janke and Saunders (who are just freelancers on the project, not employees of Maxwell's company) have run into the same issue with the game's Backerkit page, so they're unable to publish updates there either. Meanwhile the website for Oddity Press, Maxwell's publishing entity responsible for the game, is now down and showing a "website expired" error.</p><p>"None of us were involved in the actual process of the crowdfunding or order of the printing", Janke tells Aftermath. "So we’re trying to make any effort to figure out the situation around J.D. Maxwell and the current state of the crowdfunding campaign. I got in contact with the printer and as far as we know the order for the <em>Grimwild</em> print did go through to them. But without a final go from J.D. as the only legal entity from Oddity Press, the printing process can’t be started, unfortunately."</p><p>As a result, the remaining team say in their update that until Maxwell can be located, "Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely". "Until a few months ago it looked like everything was on track for the expected delivery of July this year", Saunders tells Aftermath, "but Max has been gone for a while now and there’s nothing we can do on our side to help with fulfilment I’m afraid."</p><p>A couple of days after I spoke with Janke and Saunders, the latter posted an update on the game's Discord saying they had "submitted a detailed report to the BackerKit Trust &amp; Safety Team regarding the current situation", and that the team's hope is that "BackerKit will be able to move things forward as they have much greater legal capacity and resources than we do."</p><p>The <em>Grimwild</em> community are asking anyone who may know how to get in contact with Maxwell to reach out to the game's Discord mods privately.</p><p><em>[Thanks James G]</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing]]></content:encoded>

As a result, fans might be hoping for an eventual third game in the series.

<section><p>"We have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets," Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller told GameSpot in an exclusive interview.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Without being hyperbolic--and as someone who has been an on-and-off again Overwatch fan since the original game's release back in 2016--I don't mean it lightly when I say that I believe Overwatch has never been better.</p><p dir="ltr">I've critiqued the series quite a bit throughout the years. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overwatch-2-review-same-as-it-ever-was/1900-6417972/">Overwatch 2 review</a>, I wrote at length about how it felt "detached from the principles and charm of the original," was seemingly struggling to retain its identity, and how its new monetization models felt disingenuous and "at odds with the spirit of the original Overwatch." Harsh words, yes, but I meant them. I was frustrated by what one of my all-time favorite games had become, and worried that I'd be chasing the same bliss I felt playing in 2017 endlessly and to no avail.</p><p dir="ltr">So, with all that said, how did we get here?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of Overwatch 2 with game director Aaron Keller and associate game director Alec Dawson in an exclusive interview for GameSpot, and it seems a lot of this dramatic turn-around boils down to two things: an increased emphasis on responding to player feedback, and a sharp pivot away from the "conservative" mentality the Overwatch 2 team once clung to. The result is a vastly improved game that is taking big swings with more efficiency.</p><p dir="ltr">Be it Stadium mode, Perks, the inclusion of heroes with never-before-tried mechanics, map voting, hero bans, or one of the many other tweaks and additions made to the game, Blizzard is not shying away from shaking up Overwatch 2's core gameplay loop; Season 18 is no exception. And according to Keller and Dawson, all these changes are just the beginning of the studio's push to "explore how big" Overwatch can become.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: A lot of changes have happened this year in Overwatch 2, so I would love to start by unpacking that with you both. How do you think things are going? How are you feeling about the overall health of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>When you look at the way that 2025 has gone for the game, we've done a lot of big releases. Earlier this year, we released our Perk system, which was a pretty substantial game mechanic that changed the way moment-to-moment gameplay can happen. It gave players more strategic choices that they could make over the course of a match and put more emphasis on what a hero can do and [fulfilling] that power fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 16, we released Stadium. It's probably the biggest new game mode we've ever introduced to the game and there was a lot of player excitement there. We've done a lot of other things, too. We introduced hero bans this year. We introduced map voting this year. We've introduced a new hero as well, with another one soon to come.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of players are now telling us that this is the best state that Overwatch has ever been in and we think that some of that is because we're making bigger changes to the game than we typically would have in the past. If you look back on the history of Overwatch, you could say that maybe we're a little bit conservative, but we have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets with Overwatch, and I think you'll see that when we get to Season 18.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's great to hear. Touching on that, I would love to hear a little bit more about what's coming tomorrow in Season 18.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>We look at Season 18 as sort of the next steps for a number of the big swings we've taken this year. There's around 60 new Perks that are brand new--every hero gets [a refresh]. Quick play is coming to Stadium, and then you have four new heroes coming: Brigitte, Winston, Farah, and then Tracer.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of what we're doing in [Season] 18 [stems from] evaluating what's in the game currently and evolving it in some way and/or even revamping it. Our progression system is a great example. It's been one of those things that's been in the game for a bit now, but there's a lot of screen space that players weren't really caring about; a lot of bars going up, a lot of things you're leveling up. We want to simplify it--make sure it's a lot more visible, make sure it's a lot more surfaced.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>We are doing a total revamp to our progression system. When you looked at our progression system before, it kind of just felt like there were just a bunch of bars going up all the time. It was pretty complex and so we've simplified it. But the exciting thing about it is that, not only is it easier to understand, but it has a lot of cool new rewards too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a whole rewards track where you're updating things like emotes and Play of the Game [intros]--even loot boxes and legendary loot boxes. There's a whole Ascended State where you get a really cool icon with VFX on it that lets you and other players know just how much time you've put into each one of your heroes. We have a new Hero [Skill Rating] system coming out, so you're going to know how good [you are] not just at a [particular] role, but how well you play each of your heroes in Competitive. You can see which ones you're better at, and which ones you're worse at. We also have a new advanced hero info panel, where you can look up stats on what all of the different heroes do.</p><p dir="ltr">We're bringing Stadium to Quick Play, which is one of the biggest requests that our players have for the mode, and that's coming with cross-play enabled. We have four new heroes coming to Stadium, a new game mode, Payload Race, and two brand new maps for it. You mentioned Wuyang, our new support hero, is coming, and we have changes to Roadhog too. Lucio Ball is back--this time in third-person--and there's mouse and keyboard support coming to console.</p><p dir="ltr">We even have [things] on the cosmetic side. Kiriko's getting this skateboard emote [that lets her] travel around the maps riding a skateboard. The Mythic [Character] skins and Mythic Weapon skins are really cool this season… It's a huge update to Overwatch. This is going to be one of the biggest seasons we've ever had for the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is this the biggest update in terms of sheer content? Because I feel like, based on what you're saying, I don't know if there's ever been an update quite this big.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I don't want to jump into hyperbole and say like this is the biggest one coming, but man, it's… it is big.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>There's truth to that, though, to some degree. I think our team has been getting better and better about structuring our seasons to where, now, we can create some really big beats. Season 9 felt like a big change in the game, and then they went to Season 12 which had Juno and a bunch of competitive updates. 15 and 16 [added] Perks and Stadium. And now 18, is another massive update for Overwatch. We've been getting a lot more efficient and a lot better at planning over time, which has led to these big moments for Overwatch. [We can now] decide, like, "Hey, how do we want to change the game for the middle of the year?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I can sense that. Even with your newest hero, Wuyang--he feels extremely different.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Yeah, there's a lot of unique mechanics and abilities with Wuyang that I just think it'd be great to touch on. He can surf on his own private wave and cruise around the map. He gets this speed boost with it, too, and is able to jump over gaps and things like that. He can use his staff to create this wave of water in front of him that knocks down enemies, and can turn himself or allies basically into ticking time bombs by imbuing them with water. But what I'm most excited about with Wuyang is his primary fire. He shoots out this orb, and you can kind of do it rapid fire, but at any moment, you can also take control of it and steer it, turning it into a guided missile. Even if they take cover, you can actually bend it around a corner. There's some skill expression here. It takes a little bit of practice to actually be able to do it, but once you get it, it feels so satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> I think he's one of the best support heroes we've ever made. He's an example of what a support is in Overwatch 2, where you can have a ton of impact through your offense and can make game-changing plays. Wuyang is dynamic in the sense that he has to go from offense to defense quite quickly. All of your attention is gonna be on the primary fire, landing some of those shots, and tracking people down, but then you have these defensive options that you're going to [need to] be really timely with. His guardian wave is this big wave that gives healing and gives heal boosts--it can change the fight instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">I think players are going to really love him. I know we're not supposed to play favorites, but he's a joy to play with and I think he's really special.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think he's also one of the first heroes where his skills and powers feel almost more magical rather than technological, right? I feel like Overwatch historically has always leaned more into tech rather than magic. Was that a conversation that had to be had when developing him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Oh yeah, and we have those conversations all the time. We had those conversations a lot with both Hanzo and Genji, you know, because when they summon the dragon, that feels like a pretty magical thing there as well. We do have our own internal explanations for that that we'll actually get into at some point with our players, but we're not quite ready to yet. I guess all I can really say right now is that Overwatch is a science fiction game, and so there is an explanation behind the way those work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>At this point, do you feel like you're still fighting that initial nature of being conservative? Like you both said, for a long time, Overwatch was more conservative. Are you still fighting that hesitation or is it like, "Nope, we're all in"?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I think the team has left a lot of the hesitation about being conservative behind. The question for us really is, how big do we go with releases for Overwatch? Because there's two sides of this coin. There's an active player base that really appreciates the way that the game plays right now, you know. But we also see that, anytime we do make a big release for the game, players respond to it really positively.</p><p dir="ltr">So we want to keep going big. I think what we want to do is explore how big we really can go for Overwatch. And I think as we hit seasons like 18 here, and we see players' excitement, that gives us the confidence to know this isn't just the right direction--this is something that we can expand on in the future. We can keep pushing the boundaries of what a release for Overwatch can be.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the implementation of Stadium, did you see a spike in people playing Overwatch 2? If so, how is retention following that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>There was a <em>huge</em> spike of people jumping into Stadium when it first came out. I think we went public at one point saying that over 50% of play hours in Overwatch were in Stadium. And when we do have new modes for the game, we do always see that initial burst of excitement and then it'll kind of taper off after that. And Stadium did taper off, but not to the extent that our other modes have. It's still, I think, our third most popular mode in the game right now, just behind Quick Play and Competitive.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> We view Stadium as one of the main ways to play Overwatch, and Season 18 as almost Stadium's 1.0 launch. A lot of players are clamoring to have Quick Play in there. They're clamoring for something that's a little bit more brief and doesn't have a rank associated with it. So with Quick Play, it's a best-of-five round structure and you power up your hero even faster as well.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the other main piece of feedback from players is, "Hey, my favorite hero isn't here." So we're continuing to release new heroes into Stadium. We're going to be doing that throughout the rest of the year and there's four this season who I'm really excited about. Tracer in particular. I think… She's a little wild.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I'm super excited about Winston jumping into Stadium. I love playing as him and using his mobility. Sometimes with Winston, you just feel like you're holding down primary fire a little bit too long to actually be doing what you want to do. [With Stadium], you can really juice his gun and it feels so satisfying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you land on those four heroes and what are some other heroes who you see people clamoring for and are on the docket? If you can't say right now, can you share what gameplay styles you're focused on bringing in?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> There's a lot of things we look at when we're looking at heroes for Stadium. First and foremost is how well we feel like we can make a really cool set of abilities for them. We want every hero in there to really double down on "hero fantasy." We want to make sure that comes across to our players.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first few seasons of Stadium, we really tried to have at least a few heroes per role. Eventually, I think we're going to have to break that pattern and start moving into other patterns. I think we'll start seeing, you know, maybe different numbers of heroes coming to Stadium with different role ratios.</p><p dir="ltr">We want to make sure that heroes that we know a lot of people play are available there. Like Alex said, you know, we have a lot of people saying things like, "Hey, I'm just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for my hero to join the cast." So we want to make sure that we're opening up that funnel.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a few heroes we're avoiding, you know? Like Widowmaker, who is a controversial hero that's designed around a one-shot [kill]. I think that there's probably some learnings we need to do with how we build those heroes--how we build counters for some of the sharper mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There was a recent IGN article in which you said that you'd "dropped the ball with story in Overwatch 2," and I thought that was interesting to bring up this far removed from the announcement of PvE being dropped. So do you have plans to course-correct going forward?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> Yeah. When you look back at the history of Overwatch, there are moments where there was more or less lore--where we were developing more or less story for players. And one of the things that we hear from our community--and we've been hearing it a lot lately--is that they just want there to be more of that in the game. That it feels like we're doing less of it.</p><p dir="ltr">So I think I'm actually really excited for the Wuyang hero trailer to come out and for people to get a glimpse at that hero and maybe how they tie into the bigger, broader universe. It's something that I can't really go into a lot right now, but I'm excited for players to be able to get in touch with more lore over the coming seasons this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Based on that, do you plan on having more heroes come from similar factions or the same countries? I know that, for a while there, there was more avoidance since you're trying to represent a lot of different backgrounds. But at the same time--and with the lack of PvE--do you find yourself thinking "Well actually let's add this person's best friend and have more storytelling through voice lines?" Or "Let's try to add folks from the same factions."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>Yeah, there's a delicate balance to it. We don't want to make it feel like heroes are appearing out of nowhere and like [players always have] this brand-new thing to learn. I think we've created a universe over quite some time that is very rich with tons of different characters from different factions, and we want to lean into that more and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some of the things you saw in the Freya story trailer earlier this year link back to some of the things we've already built in the world. We want to make sure that we're pulling from that world because there are characters that people have only gotten glimpses of, that they love, or that could end up as heroes one day.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>As far as where our heroes hail from, we do still like to spread heroes out across like all over the globe. That's a really important value that we've got. We do like our heroes to feel like they represent Earth, but not in the strictest sense. We don't have 40% of our heroes from China and India, which is maybe what a true representation of the global population would be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Has the team considered any other avenues for more large-scale storytelling? I'm sure you see the success of series like Arcane and Castlevania on Netflix, and I wonder if that has been something that you're interested in pursuing.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> The team would love to have something like that come out. You know, we're also fans of those shows and fans of those universes. To have something like that for Overwatch would be really, really cool. But I can't really discuss the plans for future stuff like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I completely understand. I just ask because it's something that I want to manifest into the universe. But on the subject of Overwatch's story--and now that we're a little bit more removed from what happened--do you want to go into a little bit more detail on why things didn't really work out with story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I know Blizzard holds their cards kind of close to their chests sometimes. But I don't think we really saw the critical success that we wanted and it forced us to really analyze where we were putting our time and resources. At the end of the day, what we've been telling our players is that we want to make the game that they want to play. And the game that our players have been playing is this competitive, PvP-focused hero shooter. We really realized that that was the game that we needed to invest our time into.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the release of our sole campaign, we did a really big pivot internally on the team. We wanted to focus on what it means to be a best-in-class hero shooter. What are the competitive systems that we need in order to do that? What are some of the other systems?</p><p dir="ltr">In the year since that, we've focused on evolving the game our players play--on how we turn it into the best version of Overwatch it can be. That's why we started doing these much bigger systems, like Perks and Stadium. Now that we've corrected the course, it gives us the opportunity to make bigger steps with the game. And some of those are things that players are asking for, but then some of them are really big surprises. That's the future for Overwatch right now.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity, readability, and brevity.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After a high-profile failure in Concord and a high-profile success in Astro Bot last year, PlayStation is looking to adjust its strategy to incorporate fewer live service games, more big franchises, and stricter oversight of its owned studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Financial Times</a>, PlayStation CEO Hermen Hulst says the company is hoping to mitigate future big, expensive risks with future games. “I don’t want teams to always play it safe, but I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Concord was not a cheap failure. Analysts estimate Sony spent around $250m on the game, only for it to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">sell so poorly</a> that Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-wave-goodbye-to-playstation-flop-concord-as-it-goes-dark-maybe-forever">shut it down two weeks after launch</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">shuttered its developer</a>, Firewalk Studios, not long after. By contrast, Astro Bot also launched last year to universal acclaim, winning multiple awards and <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/astro-bot/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling 2.3 million copies as of March 2025</a>, one of the best-selling games on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The differences between the two games are myriad, certainly, and their development stories are quite different as well. But what Hulst has taken away from this is that there needs to be more supervision of Sony's owned studios to ensure that games veering in the direction of Concord are spotted before they become expensive failures, so they can be canceled or corrected in time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways,” Hulst said. “The advantage of every failure . . . is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Financial Times spoke to multiple Sony studio heads, who said that this oversight means more focus on group testing, more communication between internal Sony studios, and closer relationships between the studios' top executives. “If we’re heading towards a giant landmine, like there’s another studio making exactly the same game, that’s good information,” said Jason Connell, art director at Ghost of Yōtei studio Sucker Punch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That comment rings especially poignant in light of Concord's failure, which analysts say occurred for a number of reasons, including an oversaturation of multiplayer, live service shooters. Hulst suggests in the interview that PlayStation isn't as intent on churning out live service games as it used to be. That said, PlayStation does have Bungie's Marathon coming up before March 2026, a game that has<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-concords-failure-and-marathons-delay-sony-admits-playstations-live-service-strategy-is-not-entirely-going-smoothly"> a number of Bungie fans concerned</a> amid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-admits-marathon-feedback-has-been-varied-but-insists-it-will-avoid-repeating-concord-mistakes-and-commits-to-launch-by-end-of-march-2026">delays</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">staff layoffs</a>, and a general lack of information as to what the game entails.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there's another strategy Hulst also wants to pursue: he wants more, massive Sony IP. Astro Bot's success has come about over the course of multiple games, with the little robot icon growing in popularity each time. According to Financial Times, Hulst wants studios to be thinking about how their IP can be turned into bigger and bigger franchises over time, following in the footsteps of The Last of Us and Uncharted. “We take a very intentional approach to IP creation . . . understanding how a new concept can turn into an iconic franchise for PlayStation, that can then again become a franchise for people beyond gaming,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently on the docket, PlayStation has Ghost of Yōtei and Lost Soul Aside coming this year, with Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls and Housemarque's Saros for 2026. Other games such as Fairgames, Marvel's Wolverine, Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Marathon, and more remain in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Fans of cooperative climbing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> know that ticks aren't the only bug in the game, and for the last week they've been subject to a particularly frustrating one that developers are now aware of and working to resolve: the brand new biome, the Mesa, has been missing for the last week, with only the original Alpine biome showing up in the game's seed-generated maps.</p><p>"For the last 7 days, every map has had the ALPINE," developer Team Peak wrote in a post on the game's Steam page. "Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>.

			<p>Ahead of Gamescom 2025, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-now-blackwell-rtx-5080-pc-like-latency-image-quality-install-to-play-new-games-same-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> what it has been calling the largest upgrade ever made to its GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform. The backbone is, of course, the advent of the Blackwell architecture previously seen in the GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards.</p>



<p>The Ultimate tier will be updated with RTX 5080-class (a server equivalent to the desktop GPU) GPU hardware and AMD Zen 5 CPUs. The new server hardware will deliver 62 teraflops of compute performance and a 48GB frame buffer, not to mention a performance uplift of up to 2.8x compared to the previous generation, partly thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>



<p>While important, though, this hardware upgrade is just a portion of the enhancements coming to GeForce NOW that NVIDIA showed off to press, Wccftech included, at a dedicated Gamescom 2025 event. One of the new features, Cinematic Quality Streaming or CQS, is actually a set of features that includes additions like YUV 4:4:4 chroma sampling and 10-bit HDR, AV1 support with RPR (Reference Picture Resampling), new AI-based sharpness filters to reduce noise and artifacts and make games' heads-up display (HUD) clearer, and DPI awareness. The latter is important, NVIDIA Product Marketing Manager Michael McSorley explained, because sometimes GeForce NOW didn't quite catch the correct native resolution of a user device (especially laptops) and started the streaming at a lower resolution. As a result, the user got a blurrier image that certainly didn't impress them with sharpness.</p>



<p>Overall, Cinematic Quality Streaming makes quite a bit of a difference when viewed in person side-by-side, especially in a highly detailed game like Game Science's Black Myth: Wukong, which supports full path tracing. The finer details, such as vegetation and the main character's hair, were a lot sharper with CQS enabled, reducing one of the long-standing visual downsides of cloud gaming when compared to local gaming: image compression. Of course, the difference will likely be better appreciated on a large 4K display. It should be noted that, barring the first two CQS features, the rest will also be available on non-Blackwell servers.</p>



<p>NVIDIA then flexed the power of the Blackwell-enhanced GeForce NOW experience directly against the most powerful console on the market, Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro. The game selected was CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, which the new Ultimate tier can handle easily with path tracing enabled and 4K@120FPS streaming. By comparison, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game was set to the Ray Tracing mode, which, however, locks the frame rate to 40FPS, and is also much inferior visually compared to the PC version's path tracing. With three times as powerful hardware as the PS5 Pro, NVIDIA boasts that the best console-like experience can be streamed via its upgraded cloud gaming service.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>GeForce NOW is also evolving when it comes to latency, another inherent problem with cloud gaming. The NVIDIA servers already supported Reflex, but they are now being updated with <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/networking/rivermax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivermax</a> hardware packet pacing, an NVIDIA technology that enables direct data transfers to and from the GPU, delivering 'best-in-class throughput and latency with minimal CPU utilization for streaming workloads', according to the GeForce company. </p>



<p>In addition to that, NVIDIA has been working in the last couple of years with various ISPs to persuade them to add L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss and Scalable Throughput). This network protocol has the potential to reduce latency when sending and receiving packets. Unfortunately, L4S has to be adopted by the ISPs; so far, Comcast, T-Mobile, and BT Group have done it, but there's many more to go across all the countries supported by GeForce NOW. Moreover, the router you're using must support L4S, too, which means even if your ISP has added L4S to its network, you may have to change the router if you've got an old one. It is, of course, far from guaranteed that ISPs will issue everyone a new compatible router for free.</p>



<p>On the local devices, NVIDIA is adding support for 90FPS streaming on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-native-steam-deck-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">native Steam Deck app</a>, 120FPS streaming on the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/lenovo-legion-go-s-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-soc-priced-lower-than-legion-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, 4K@120FPS streaming on LG TVs via the native GFN app, 5K@120FPS on LG OLED monitors, and 1080P@360FPS or 1440P@240FPS. At 360FPS streaming, NVIDIA showed an end-to-end latency (not just network latency) of less than 30ms, with peaks of 15-17ms, making it more than viable to play competitive shooters via GeForce NOW. Of course, there's always room for improvement, and we asked Michael McSorley whether NVIDIA would ever try to shelve a few more milliseconds of latency by creating a direct connection from the wireless gamepad to the GeForce NOW servers, like Stadia did. The Product Marketing Manager said it could happen, though they'd have to find a suitable partner on the gamepad side.</p>



<p>There's more, as NVIDIA is also extending the GFN support of racing wheel devices as well as expanding accessibility through the 2200 new Steam games that will benefit from the new Install-to-Play feature, not to mention a limited-time GFN trial available to stream Fortnite directly via Discord.</p>



<p>One thing is clear: NVIDIA already offers the best cloud gaming experience, and all these improvements can only bring it closer to the experience of playing locally. We'll need to do private testing of the new Blackwell-architecture GeForce NOW servers to say exactly how much. The rollout will gradually begin next month with only 20 games supported, though that list is expected to grow rapidly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After nearly 50 years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">Cracker Barrel</a> changed its logo last week. You probably heard or read something about it, as news of the change and the reaction to it became one of the biggest topics on the internet. And so, somehow, that leads us to a person online replacing the Cracker Barrel logo with the entirety of <em>Robocop</em> from 1987.</p> <p>On August 23, a few days after the Cracker Barrel news had swept the internet and sparked countless blogs and articles (<a href="https://kotaku.com/new-cracker-barrel-logo-woke-trump-cooperate-greed-2000619204">even we wrote about it</a>), Twitter user Kodiak posted to the dying social media site the “full 1987 film <em>RoboCop</em> rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo.” You might be wondering a few things, namely: Why? Well, don’t worry, Kodiak doesn’t want to leave you with a mystery. Why did they re-render <em>RoboCop</em> as the Cracker Barrel logo?&nbsp; “Because nothing matters,” <a href="https://x.com/thisiskodiak/status/1959402871939862841">posted Kodiak</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full 1987 film RoboCop rendered as the Cracker Barrel logo. Because nothing matters. <a href="https://t.co/0e1UjAezJY">pic.twitter.com/0e1UjAezJY</a></p> <p>— Kodiak (@ThisIsKodiak) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsKodiak/status/1959402871939862841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is this the ideal way to watch <em>RoboCop</em>? Some might say yes. <a href="https://x.com/jenny____r/status/1959668520452862246">At least one person has seemingly watched the film on their big screen TV</a>, which is fun to think about. Another question you might be pondering—between never-ending thoughts about Cracker Barrel’s new, boring logo and what it means in relation to modern-day society—is a simple one: Is this legal? I’m not a lawyer. I’d probably say no, but these days it really does seem like law and order is out the window, and the rich and powerful can do whatever they want. Ohhh….wait, now I get why they picked <em>RoboCop</em> for this joke. Funny! (Shout out to <em><a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/a-b-testing-your-anti-woke-meltdown-e1a04224ffbb38b6">Garbage Day</a></em> for spotting this.)</p> <p>Anyway, go ahead and watch <em>RoboCop</em> until Twitter kills the video. At the moment, it has over 550k views, so it seems like Elon Musk and whoever still works at Twitter don’t care. Or they forgot the password to the account that lets them delete stuff. Either way, enjoy <em>RoboCop</em>. Or you can go buy and play that <a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568">awesome <em>RoboCop</em> game from a few years back</a>. Do both at the same time? What do I care? I’m not your dad.</p>

                <p>Sony recently announced a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBA 2K26 PS5 Slim Bundle</a> is set to arrive on September 5. As the name implies, this will include the PS5 Slim model with a disc drive, a DualSense controller, and the upcoming NBA 2K26. It's arriving on September 5, the same day NBA 2K26 launches on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We're still waiting on pricing details for the new bundle, but considering Sony <strong>increased the PS5's price on August 21</strong>, we're expecting it to be more expensive than previous bundles. Still, bundles like this are always popular, so set a reminder for September 5 if you're thinking about picking one up.</p><div title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4175" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">Pricing TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle pulls together a PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Controller, and a digital voucher for NBA 2K26. It's unclear what format the game is--tough judging by previous bundles, we expect it will be a digial code.</p><p>The bigger question is price. The base PS5 Slim now costs $550 (was $500) and PS5 Slim Digital costs $500 (was $450--and before that was $400 at launch), we're expecting this to be pricier than previous bundles. For example, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases/1100-6534138/" data-ref-id="1100-6534138">PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle</a> was previously available for just $400, offering a value of $570. The bundle didn't last long at that promotional price, and we'd expect this upcoming NBA 2K26 bundle to be much more expensive. At the very least, we're hoping the bundle ends up being cheaper than buying everything individually. Expect to learn more as we quickly approach its September 5 release date. Availability of the bundle will vary by region. Most markets should find it on PlayStation Direct, though other local retailers may also have inventory.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're worried about pricing--or don't need NBA 2K26, consider grabbing a PS5 at Amazon.

                <p>Besides creating many iconic cult movies like Halloween, The Thing, and Escape From New York, you may also be aware that filmmaker John Carpenter is an ardent fan of video games. Has he then finally decided to make one? Well, yes and no. Toxic Commando may bear his name in the title, but the real credit goes to developer and publisher Saber Interactive. Still, after playing this apocalyptic co-op first-person shooter for the first time at Gamescom 2025, I see how it bears his influence. This isn't just a cynical marketing stunt to put his name on the box.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to kind of tap into those '80s horror and over-the-top action films like Big Trouble in Little China, so we reached out to Carpenter, who was like, 'Yeah, this is great,'" said Saber's chief creative officer, Tim Willits. "He's played the game with us, he's helped with some concepts, he's been good about saying, 'Focus on these types of things when you tell this type of story.'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDfS-wDsmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahDfS-wDsmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It may be more accurate to describe Carpenter as having more of a consulting role rather than being deeply involved in development. But his role is also more hands-on at least in some areas: The director famously composed some of the themes for his own influential movies, and has written music that will be incorporated into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While not directly referencing Carpenter's back catalog, the story of Toxic Commando, about a corporation seeking a new limitless power source that unwittingly awakens an evil entity, is totally the kind of idea I can imagine he might have conceived of in the peak of his filmmaking career--this evil is even named the Sludge God, which is as unapologetically B-movie as it gets.</p><p dir="ltr">Our four-player session was less focused on the story than it was on just diving into the gameplay itself. Willits recommends the best way to catch up on the backstory is through the comic book prequels Saber has produced in partnership with Dark Horse Comics.</p><p dir="ltr">"The story is very fun and quirky, but it does not get in the way," he said, though those who do want to get immersed in the story can also opt to solo the game with computer-controlled bots as teammates. That should provide a better way to appreciate the moment-to-moment chatter with the other titular commandos--the laid-back Walter, the nihilistic Ruby, the empathetic Cato, and the natural leader Astrid--each played by small-screen actors whose likenesses have also been faithfully rendered in-game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a session cannot have everyone picking the same character, they're not bound to specific roles on the team like in, say, a hero shooter. Every player gets to have their own personal journey in terms of loadout and classes. The latter mostly refers to the mutant abilities you have equipped from a device strapped to your chest that's keeping you from being corrupted by the Sludge God's infection. Usually, this means being able to drop area-of-effect fields that your buddies can stay in to improve their defense or offense, the kind of boost you'd want when facing down hordes of undead. There's also no restriction if everyone in your party decides to play a support class, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, when it's a co-op FPS that involves blasting zombies, thoughts of Left 4 Dead aren't far behind. However, the shooter I ended up thinking about as we took on our demo mission was actually Halo, Saber having also had a hand in that game's anniversary edition remaster. Not only was the map we roamed a pretty large sandbox, with plenty of optional areas to explore and also mark with pins, we could also get around in vehicles. These are randomized in each session, so you might come across a pick-up truck or an ambulance van, or find an armored vehicle where someone can get onto the gun turret while the camera pulls back in third person for the driver. It has the same joy as piling onto a Warthog with your buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some considerations to keep in mind with the vehicles you drive, though--they need gas to run, so you might need to find fuel to top up the tank. A turret also has limited ammo, so you won't be able to use it indefinitely. Some vehicles might not have the tires to handle going up some steep and muddy slopes, and it's impressive how Toxic Commando essentially makes use of the tech seen in Saber's off-road driving sims like Mudrunner and Snowrunner to give vehicles different capabilities in a variety of situations. Again, the armored vehicles are the most capable for getting around, and come with a very handy winch that can be used for pulling down barriers in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The real technical star of the show, however, is Saber's proprietary Swarm Engine. Originally created for World War Z's huge zombie hordes, and impressively utilized for the swarm of Tyranids in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Willits said the engine has evolved to even greater heights in Toxic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">"The environments are much larger than they were in World War Z, so the swarms come in all sorts of different directions," he explained. "We have more super creatures, special monsters, but just like our upgrade progression system in World War Z and Space Marine 2, you have different classes and you can upgrade your abilities, loadouts, even some of your passives."</p><p dir="ltr">That also ensures there's never a dull moment. When following the objective of destroying specific tendril nodes so that we could reach a church, we encountered a swarm of undead. But even when exploring other points of interest, the engine keeps the map populated with enemies so that there's always something to shoot or contend with while trying to find loot and stock up on supplies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At times, the non-stop hordes can get overwhelming. Case in point: Toward the end of the mission, we reached the church and had to endure a siege of undead coming from all directions. Willits said Toxic Commando is probably the most difficult game the studio has made in years, given how much the action can ramp up. But that difficulty is managed in real-time by the Swarm Engine's AI director that's designed to also make you feel like the odds are against you.</p><p dir="ltr">"It keeps track of who you're fighting and balances the difficulty," he explained. "When you're playing and feel like, 'My god, I'm not going to survive,' and then you just pull through at the last second, a lot of that is the AI director."</p><p dir="ltr">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Turok knows a thing or two about rebirth. The original character debuted in a 1950s comic book but came to wider attention after Valiant Comics revived him as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in the early '90s. It was this comic that became the basis for the game series that began on the N64, which was arguably the most influential console-based shooter of the time after GoldenEye. Following 17 years of dormancy after the mixed reception of its 2008 self-titled reboot (while it wasn't actually a commercial flop, a sequel was nonetheless canned), Saber Interactive has stepped up to the plate to make the cycle begin anew with Turok: Origins.</p><p dir="ltr">I was admittedly skeptical when it was first announced at last year's Game Awards, as it seemed to be a third-person co-op shooter. The good news from my first hands-on at Gamescom 2025 is that the game can be played in both first- and third-person, and while this preview session was about getting a feel for the co-op PvE gameplay for up to three players, members of Saber Interactive's Madrid-based team assured us that it will also be possible to play the game solo without AI allies, so as to stay true to the original single-player experience of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUPvMp_s5nc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUPvMp_s5nc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But most importantly, Turok: Origins gets back to the fundamental core of what you want from a Turok game: killing dinosaurs with big guns.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, some twists to that formula. As the subtitle suggests, this is a revival that goes back in the timeline, to well before the original game. Turok isn't the name of a character but rather a tribe of hunters, while still very much taking its inspiration from tribes indigenous to North America. As you would expect from a team-based game, you have a choice of different classes to play as, each inspired by different spirit animals--Raven, Cougar, and Bison--which dictate the loadout and abilities you have, though you're free to change classes before each mission starts.</p><p dir="ltr">The dinos are actually referred to as Xenia, a hostile reptilian force that's predominantly made up of familiar four-legged lizards, though this also gives license to introduce some more humanoid enemies, as well as what could be best described as a troll with scales. But wisely, the first mission in this demo gave me what I wanted from the outset, which was to drop us into a prehistoric-looking jungle while being jumped by waves of raptors. They were a blast to dispatch, whether I was playing with a first- or third-person perspective, which is something that you can seamlessly switch between. The third-person option also lets you toggle which shoulder the camera is behind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The reason behind the controls feeling so good may be down to the developer confirming that the pipelines for first-person and third-person are actually separate, so they do feel distinct. You can also see some differences such as how, when hitting crouch while sprinting, you'll perform a slide in first-person but roll forward when in third-person. Melee is also an option, and even when playing in first-person, the camera will always pull back to third-person. I can see how this is more ideal for performing a variety of brutal cinematic finishers; when you've weakened a dino to the point they're glowing yellow, your prompt to move in as your hunter rips them apart from their long jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">As cool as some of these execution animations were, I couldn't do them as often as I wanted, mostly because another teammate was still raining ammo on them and finished them off before I could press the prompt in time. In a subsequent mission inside an ancient temple, the team was able to split up to tackle threats coming from different directions, which gave me more opportunity to dispatch Xenia as I saw fit. At the same time, I was also trying out each of the available, first with the automatic-toting Cougar, and then the tankier Bison and their close-range shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class also has three unique cooldown-based abilities as well as an ultimate, typical of modern class-based shooters. After a couple of missions, I found my groove with Raven's long range bow, and I was pulling off many satisfying headshots. One downside, though, was if I didn't kill them instantly, then I'd be too far away to run in for the killing blow. Despite this, it was with this Raven class that I used their abilities with the most confidence, including one where they charged up a sort of rallying cry that instantly killed weak enemies, summoned a swarm of glowing wasps to attack a nearby target, or created a temporary barrier against projectiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I nonetheless did return to Cougar for the demo's final encounter, an arena boss fight against a huge Triceratops that almost had a whiff of Monster Hunter about it. With my medium-ranged auto-plasma shots, it was a good way of landing hits from a distance while being able to dodge when it charged at me with its horns. The Cougar's ultimate is also especially useful by temporarily granting you a very powerful bow that you can let loose an infinite supply of arrows.</p><p dir="ltr">There was quite a lot to take in, as the developer ushered us through a varied and curated experience within 30 minutes. To ensure a tight pace, the dev made everyone gather in a glowing blue circle when it was time to advance to the next part of a mission--which also meant some optional paths were deliberately walled off for the demo. Even in this more linear structure, however, I still had the opportunity to use my grapple to swing up over certain walls or jump up to higher ground to take down out-of-reach enemies. That kind of platforming traversal is another hallmark from the original Turok games that carries over here.</p><p dir="ltr">While I would still prefer to be able to get the chance to experience Turok: Origins in a single-player scenario, this first hands-on has nonetheless put aside any initial doubts I might have had. In Saber Interactive Spain's hands, a franchise many had assumed would remain a fossil looks like it's getting a revival that could actually stick around this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Turok: Origins is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>XSEED Games has announced that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack is coming to Switch consoles</a> in the US on October 28. The Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack collects the four visual novels in the Heavenly Host saga--which includes Corpse Party, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash, and Corpse Party: Blood Drive. It also marks the first time Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash will be playable on Switch. All four games in the collection are presented with their original Japanese voiceover and English subtitles and are enhanced with high-definition graphics and audio. Preorders are available now for $50 exclusively at Amazon. The Corpse Party series rarely gets physical releases, so we're expecting the collection to sell out quickly.</p><div title="6534238 - Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack Switch Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4198" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534238 - Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack Switch Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases October 28</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack includes all four remastered visual novels in the collection on a physical Nintendo Switch card.

Physical copies for this collection are available exclusively at Amazon. Digital preorders are also available.</p></div>                      </div><p>For those unfamiliar, Corpse Party is a series of supernatural horror visual novels with branching outcomes, multiple endings, and plenty of scares and gruesome murders. The first game, Corpse Party, tells the story of a friendship ritual gone horrifically awry after it transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality. Exploring the Heavenly Host Elementary institution, the group has to risk their sanity and safety to uncover the truth behind bone-chilling murders that occurred at the location, if they ever want to return home again. The version included in the collection is the 2021 version of the game that was released for PC, which itself is actually the third remake of Corpse Party originally released for the PS Vita in 2010.</p><p>The next game, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, is an ambitious anthology series released in 2011 that served as a sequel, prequel, midquel, <em>and</em> an alternate universe tale, all in one package. It builds on the events of the first game, offering players new perspectives on several of the original game's most critical events.</p><p>2012's Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash is billed as a midquel set that takes place during the events of Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. It tells the story of the ghost of Sachiko Shinozaki’s murderous birthday party at Heavenly Host Elementary.</p><p>Finally, Corpse Party: Blood Drive was released in 2014 and is set two months after Book of Shadows. Designed to be the ultimate conclusion to the Heavenly Host story arc, the story revolves around black magic, the end of the world, and a mission to resurrect fallen friends.</p><p>While Corpse Party: Blood Drive was the final game in the Heavenly Host story arc, it's not the end of the franchise. A spiritual sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corpse-party-2-darkness-distortion-preorder-guide/1100-6522304/" data-ref-id="1100-6522304">Corpse Party 2: Darkness Distortion</a>, is set to launch in Jun 2026--giving you enough time to catch up on the previous four games with the new collection. Darkness Distortion will once again be a visual novel, this time following three high school friends as they explore the Amare Est Vivere Hospital to see if a local urban legend is true.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-wanted-the-development-of-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-be-just-as-fun-as-the-game.1280190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During Gamescom 2025 last week in Cologne, Germany, I went hands-on with No More Heroes developer Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, and came away with more questions than answers (but in the best way possible). Fortunately, I immediately transitioned from my hands-on preview to a couch, where I sat across from the game's director, Goichi Suda AKA Suda51, and his interpreter, and asked him the new questions I had.&nbsp;</p><p>But first, let me set the scene of my demo: before gameplay began, I watched a quick intro you've likely seen in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/grasshopper-manufacture-announces-romeo-is-a-dead-man-an-ultra-violent-sci">game's reveal trailer</a> that shows Romeo die, then be resurrected and turned into a space cop/FBI agent/expert mercenary/cyborg hybrid. From here, I was brought to a screen with three impeccably designed chocolates. I forgot the name of the first chocolate (and unfortunately didn't write it down), but it represented the game's easy mode; the orange chocolate I chose represented normal, and the ginger-infused chocolate was the game's hard mode. I was then thrust right into the action.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>I'm not quite sure where I was, but it was reminiscent of a junk yard; gray, foggy, and swarmed with zombies and other monstrous creatures Romeo needed to kill. Doing so was a blast, thanks to a combat system that feels fast, fluid, and visceral, with a large selection of weaponry to use. I used a machine gun, a pistol, a grasshopper-shaped rocket launcher, and a fusion rifle, of sorts, as well as a katana-like sword, a colossal two-handed sword, and more. All of them are easily accessible with a combo of buttons tied to the d-pad. I like that each gun has a different feel, and that each melee weapon features its own moveset, all in the name of dismembering and beheading hordes of zombies and everything else that stands in the way of Romeo.&nbsp;</p><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man was, by far, the bloodiest demo I saw during Gamescom, and I previewed more than two dozen games, including Resident Evil Requiem. Despite the gallons and gallons of blood, though, it comes off comedically rather than horrifically, thanks to the game's visual flair.&nbsp;</p><p>After I mowed down enough enemies in this junkyard-like area, I warped into cyberspace, another visually distinct part of the game with its own narrative ties. There was a boss at the end of this area, but I wasn't able to reach it as my time to interview Suda51 had arrived. Before diving into what I learned from my interview, I'll close out my preview thoughts here by saying I continue to grow increasingly intrigued by what the hell Romeo Is A Dead Man is doing each time I see and play it. It's hard to explain what this game is, but that's part of its charm, and I can't wait to find out how all its seemingly disparate pieces connect when it launches next year.&nbsp;</p><h2>Discussing Romeo Is A Dead Man And Grasshopper Manufacture With Suda51</h2>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's </strong></em><strong>Wesley LeBlanc: There is a lot going on in Romeo Is A Dead Man, but from a broad approach, what are the inspirations behind the game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Suda51: </strong>You may have noticed playing a bit of the game, but a few of the main influences and inspirations for the game are <em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>, which itself was inspired by <em>Back to the Future</em>. We wanted to do something with space time and time travel, and the whole thing started off with looking to those two properties.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There are so many distinct art styles in Romeo Is A Dead Man. What are some of the inspirations behind that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the art and visual style go, that aspect of the game didn't have much to do with the [<em>Back to the Future </em>and <em>Rick and Morty</em>] influences. Where that came from was basically, I wanted to make sure all the staff members working on the game were able to do their best and what they're best at.</p><p>For the art, if we have one staff member good at Western-style comic book art, I'd say, "I want you to draw this scene, it'd look really great with your style." Somebody else is really good at a different style, and I would think of a scene for that person in particular to work on. It was about finding a proper rhythm for each scene, matching the content of the scene and what the characters are doing, and how it could be portrayed best.&nbsp;</p><p>I try to match up all the members of the staff to a scene, let them do the best at what they do, and jamming it all together.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>That's a very different director approach from what I hear about studios in the West. What's your philosophy behind that directorial style and letting people do things in their own vision?</strong></p><p>It's pretty simple, really. As far as my philosophy goes, I want it to be fun. We want to make fun games that people like playing, and we want everything about game development to be fun, too. In game development, there's a lot of heavy s*** to deal with, hard times to deal with, so I wanted not just playing the game to be fun, but the development and creation of it to be as fun as possible, too.&nbsp;</p><p>I lay out my ideas in meetings, and we might have some planning, but I let people from any department talk, tweak versions of ideas, and create a collaborative process. Anyone can cross out ideas, combine something to make new ideas, or take separate ideas and turn them into different things. We try to make it as fun as possible, and I want everyone to have as much fun as they can creating the game. We want them to know their opinions are heard and respected.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do you factor in game balance with that approach?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A lot of game developers don't like thinking like this, because it might "ruin the balance of the game" if there are too many ideas. I don't care about that personally; I want the game to be fun and interesting. As far as balance goes, I'll take care of that in the end. If you have a good idea, let everybody know, and in the end, I'll make sure everything is as balanced as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the team we've put together, they trust me to take care of that balance, which is why they feel free to put out different ideas they have. They can trust in me. Balance is probably one of the things I'm best at as a game developer – taking all these ideas that might not seem related, and balancing them.</p><p><strong>Can you talk to me about the process behind the game's combat design?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As far as the combat goes, that was actually mainly up to one of our lead programmers, Toru Hironaka, who has been at Grasshopper for years. I kind of left the combat and general action up to him because I know he knows what he's doing.&nbsp;</p><p>From the beginning, I knew there were going to be gun-type weapons and sword-type weapons, and I wanted to make both appealing. I knew we had to make them fun to use and as interesting as any other weapon, so I talked with Hironaka and said, 'These are the systems and action I want, do what you do best." I had other staff members give input, too.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as the action stuff goes, it's mainly Hironaka leading, but as a whole, [Romeo Is A Dead Man] came together the way it did through the power of teamwork. It's never just one guy doing everything by himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The time between your last release and Romeo Is A Dead Man [due out in 2026] is the longest in development history at Grasshopper Manufacture. Why?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The main reason it took so long is timing, basically. For example, right around when we started on Romeo Is A Dead Man, it was right about the time <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/10/22/netease-games-acquires-suda51s-grasshopper-manufacture">we left GungHo Entertainment and joined NetEase</a>, and we increased staff members, and it took them time to get used to how we do things and vice versa. Also, up through No More Heroes III, we worked on Unreal Engine 4, but Romeo Is A Dead Man is being developed in Unreal Engine 5, so our first year developing [Romeo Is A Dead Man], it was people learning Unreal Engine 5, learning how to work with each other, learning how the company works, and everyone getting used to each other and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>That's the biggest reason it took so long. It's not necessarily that the game is huge, and it wasn't the <em>worst </em>possible timing; everything just happened at the point in time that would result in us taking the most time to get the game done.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Romeo Is A Dead Man launches sometime next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/romeo-is-a-dead-man-has-so-many-art-styles-because-suda51-wanted-artists]]></content:encoded>

<p>"They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware."</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We're almost three months on from the Nintendo Switch 2's release, and while we have plenty of third-party games to come on the newer hybrid console, many developers say that they're still having issues getting hold of dev kits.</p>
<p>This comes from the folks at Digital Foundry in response to a question from a listener during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0SW7R5H5wY&amp;t=500s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry">this week's DF Direct</a> (timestamped, 8:20). Part of the question focuses on Switch 2 kits, particularly pointing out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>, which runs at 30fps on the newer console (though it doesn't have a specific Switch 2 version either): "Do you think Nintendo are regretting not sharing the dev kits wider, sooner?"</p>
<p>Host John Linneman, who was at Gamescom 2025, spoke to multiple developers on the show floor where "so many of them said the same thing," and that "It's really difficult right now" to even get hold of a dev kit.</p>
<p>It sounds like the enthusiasm is there — "They would love to do Switch 2 versions. They can’t get the hardware." — but the ability to get the hardware teams need to make Switch 2 games is tough. Some were apparently told "they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility."</p>

<p>Co-host Oliver Mackenzie also weighed in, saying "I don't really understand the strategy" Nintendo is implementing in handing out dev kits.</p>
<p>The team reports "hearing things through the grapevine and talking to people" on some "weird exclusions" and "weird inclusions" , highlighting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/chillin-by-the-fire">Chillin' by the Fire</a> as one of the latter games: "...Some big developers, on the other hand, who developed AAA stuff aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits.”</p>
<p>Of course, the only people who know what's actually going on with these dev kits are at Nintendo; Mouse Work, a game specifically designed to be played in Mouse Mode, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit">can't release on Switch 2 <em>until</em> the devs get a kit</a>. Nintendo is reportedly focusing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">on indie developers and smaller studios</a>, but that still leaves a lot of teams out.</p>
<p>When you get reports about some third-party games running better on Switch 2 than others; for example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">impressed</a> at Gamescom while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">did not</a>.</p>

              <p>It’s&nbsp;<span>highly unlikely that we’ll see <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-valve-erik-wolpaw-half-life-alyx-steam-counter-s-1848807049">a new&nbsp;<em>Portal</em> game</a> anytime soon from series creators </span>Valve. But now you can create your own<em> Portal 3</em> in a place I didn’t expect: <em>Minecraft</em>. Or you can play through 50 pre-made <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-2-is-the-better-portal-but-you-better-bring-a-f-5793326"><em>Portal</em> <em>2</em></a> puzzles via a newly released <em>Minecraft</em> mod.</p> <p>On August 22, <a href="https://portaljavaedition.net/about">a group of 20+ modders and fan devs released <em>Portal: Java Edition</em></a>, a free remake of Valve’s 2011 first-person puzzler built entirely in vanilla Minecraft using resource and data packs. That <em>technically</em> means the project, which is free to download now on PC, doesn’t use any “mods,” though the creators do include extra third-party mods that help with optimization. And you’ll likely want to install those if you plan to play. This rebuilt version of<em> Portal 2</em> in <em>Minecraft</em> is pushing the Java version of the popular crafting game hard, and it can chug on even beefy PCs without the extra mods.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal: Java Edition | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v7ZfuKZNis?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to the team behind it<em>, Portal: Java Edition</em> started development in 2020 and has taken roughly five years to complete. The mod includes all the mechanics and features from <em>Portal 2</em>, including portals (of course), lasers, light bridges, and mobility gels. The project is shipping with 50 levels spread across eight map packs. And if you burn through all of those, well, don’t worry, you can make some more, thanks to the included level editor. The level editor should be pretty easy to use for <em>Minecraft</em> vets, as it seems to function just like building anything else in Mojang’s crafting game, just with more big red buttons and companion cubes.</p> <p>To play <em>Portal: Java Edition</em>, you’ll need to own <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> on PC and then download the project’s files from GitHub. I had to download an older version of <em>Minecraft</em> to get <em>Portal</em> working in the game, but that’s not too hard and is fully supported by the official <em>Minecraft</em> launcher. Once more people are playing this and building levels in it, I expect to replay <em>Doom’s</em>&nbsp;E1M1 and the first level of<em> Super Mario Bros</em>. in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-has-%E2%80%98written-the-concept%E2%80%99-for-death-stranding-3-but-he-won%E2%80%99t-be-making-it.1280172/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been two months since Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was released, with Hideo Kojima delivering big on yet another cinematic masterpiece that turned heads worldwide. In the short time that has followed, Kojima has busied himself promoting every angle of the game on social media and at the world tour events set up to showcase the game.</p>



<p>Many have wondered where the series goes from here, especially given the increasingly large window between releases. The first Death Stranding title dropped in 2019, and it took <strong>six years </strong>to produce a second game. Will Kojima be around for the third game? He has written a concept, but doesn’t think it’ll be him who makes Death Stranding 3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hideo-kojima-make-another-death-stranding-game">Will Hideo Kojima Make Another Death Stranding Game?</h2>



<p>The Death Stranding series is equal parts emotional, action-packed, and bizarre. To outsiders, it represents a kind of walking or delivery guy simulator, but to those who have experienced it, Death Stranding is something phenomenal, tumultuous, and mind-bending.</p>



<p>That’s a touch of the sentiments handed down by fans over the last two months, anyway.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AwQDoD9TK6w?t=3114s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent appearance</a> on the ‘World Strand Tour’, Hideo Kojima and his team stopped off in Saudi Arabia to further promote Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. In one segment, the interviewer asked the crowd, ‘Who wants Death Stranding 3?’</p>



<p>That prompted a telling response from Kojima:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m not planning to do that at the moment, because the ending of Death Stranding 2 was my finale of 1 and 2, but I already wrote the concept of DS3, so I have that in data.</p>



<p>I hope that someone will create it for me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/hideo-kojima-says-hes-already-written-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-he-wants-someone-else-to-make-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Kojima went on to dive into the creation of Death Stranding 2, stressing that the COVID-19 pandemic threw a major spanner into the works, something that he has mentioned plenty of times in the past.</p>



<p>In June, Hideo Kojima spoke frankly about his health and the future of his company, Kojima Productions. He stressed that if his team tries to outright replicate his work when he has passed on, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-company-fail-replicate-work/">the company will fail</a>. For the last few years, Kojima has been stressing acute awareness of the fragility of life, showing a vulnerability that has made him more endearing, if nothing else.</p>

"Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility," said John Linneman, a senior staff writer for Digital Foundry. "There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things." GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing story surrounding Switch 2 from before launch and even as recently as last month. In April, a report surfaced stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/">small developers were struggling to get their hands on dev kits for the hybrid system</a>. But it's not just indie teams, as a July report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">some AAA studios having a hard time acquiring them</a>, too. This could be why there haven't been a slew of major third-party releases, or announcements, for the system lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Oliver Mackenzie, a contributor at Digital Foundry, touched on AAA studios possibly still not getting Switch 2 dev kits. "But like there's that campfire game, you know the kind of camera campfire game, and they're getting kits, and some big developers on the other hand, who developed like AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits," said Mackenzie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chillin-by-the-fire-out-today-on-switch-2-allows-you-to-chill-by-a-fire/1100-6533581/">Chillin by the Fire is the game</a> that Mackenzie is referencing, and it launched right after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/#1">the Nintendo Direct in July</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 has broken home console sales records</a> since launching June 5. In fact, at the start of this month, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 has already sold 6 million units</a>. Looking ahead, there are rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">a possible Nintendo Direct set for mid-September</a>.

              <p><em>Replaced</em> has been turning heads since it was first revealed back at E3 2021 (RIP), but actually completing the game has taken longer than anyone thought it would, including its developers at Sad Cat Studios. At long last, there’s good news, though: the team recently confirmed the gorgeous pixel art action game will arrive sometime next spring.</p> <p>That early 2026 timeframe will be a bummer to those secretly hoping <em>Replaced</em> might still sneak out onto PC and Xbox before the end of the year, but it’s better than nothing for fans who have been waiting years to finally see the cinematic cyberpunk platformer in action for themselves. After missing its original 2022 launch window, the day-and-date Game Pass game has been subject to continuous delays. A 2024 launch slipped into 2025, which has now slipped into 2026. What makes this time any different?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Replaced: Official Development Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPoyEkQePA4?start=146&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“This is the first time I’m addressing this personally and that’s because I can finally say it with confidence,” game director Yura Zhdanovich revealed in a new developer update. “<em>Replaced</em> will be released in spring of 2026. We will need just a little more time to get it polished. And to be more precise, our final trailer for the game with the exact release date will be shown later this year.”</p>  <p>Zhdanovich seems to be teasing a final date getting announced at The Game Awards 2025. Until then, <em>Replaced</em> has looked surprisingly good during its recent showing at Gamescom. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Much like<em> Silksong</em></a>, its repeated delays seem to have less to do with development woes (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">minus having to relocate because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) than the fact that Sad Cat Studios had just been severely underestimating how much time it would take to get <em>Replaced</em> right.</p> <h2 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"><em>Replaced</em> is more than just eye-candy</h2> <p>Sporting a <em>Batman: Arkham</em>-like, combo-based combat system and tons of vibrant, detailed pixel art backgrounds, <em>Replaced</em> is exactly the kind of “hand-crafted” indie project that deserves as much production time as it can get. Add in the cinematic mood and ambiance of puzzle-platform games like <em>Inside</em> and <em>Planet of Lana</em>, and you have the recipe for something very special if Sad Cat Studios can pull it off. The latest demo of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8Buktx_K0">looks as promising as ever</a>.</p>  <div tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"> <p>“We have done more than 600 clips of animation, which effectively translates to several thousands of hand painted frames of those animations blended together with beautiful VFX, amplifying the mix between retro and modern visuals,” Zhdanovich said. No AI-generated slop in sight. You love to see it.</p> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may have gotten our first look at Noah Centineo’s Ken in the upcoming Street Fighter film. Last week, we got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-photo-teases-wwe-superstar-cody-rhodes-as-guile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a shadowy glimpse</a> at Cody Rhodes’ Guile on set. While we didn’t see much outside his lore-accurate hair, it was enough for fans to go crazy. Now, a new picture, thanks to Noah Centineo’s social media, shows us what his Ken may look like.</p>



<p>Legendary’s Street Fighter, directed by Kitao Sakurai (Bad Trip, Twisted Metal), started filming earlier this month. After it announced the loaded cast, including Warrior’s Andrew Koji as Ryu, Aquaman’s Jason Momoa as Blanka, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie-has-reportedly-lined-up-chun-li-balrog-actors/">50 Cent as Balrog</a>, many were cautiously optimistic about the adaptation. While no official release date is set yet, it’s not stopping some teases on set on social media, like with Noah Centineo.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-s-noah-centineo-teases-first-look-at-ken-masters">Street Fighter’s Noah Centineo Teases First Look at Ken Masters</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>In a new photo from the Black Adam actor, Noah Centineo shows off his muscles in his trailer. We can also see that his hair, unknown if real or fake, is down and dyed yellow. To further confirm it’s Ken, Centineo captioned the post “Road brawler”, which is a cheeky hint at the title Street Fighter. Considering how Ken looks in the games, he does seem to resemble the American-born rival of Ryu rather well. </p>



<p>Of course, it’s one thing to look the part and another to act it out. Though considering Centineo’s burgeoning action career with The Recruit, he may be a perfect fit for Ken Masters. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if more set photos regarding Street Fighter will be seen as they film in Australia. The fighting franchise is no stranger to adaptations, but many are hopeful that Legendary’s take will succeed.</p>



<p>What do you think about Noah Centineo’s Ken Masters look? Are you excited for Legendary’s Street Fighter film? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You can't find these deals at Amazon.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7M7R?object_uuid=e3687668-be38-4145-b9ee-389cae089050&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Best Buy Labor Day sale</a> has officially kicked off, and some of the best deals are on Nintendo Switch games. There aren't any Switch 2 titles on sale here, but there are quite a few discounts on popular Mario games that are rare enough to be of note. According to Best Buy's sale page, these deals will last from now until Monday, September 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a total of four Mario Switch games with $20 discounts right now, as well as one Legend of Zelda game. If you've been hoping to pick up something fun to play ahead of the long weekend, these deals are definitely worth a look. Best Buy is currently offering the best prices on these games, even with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-labor-day-sale-2025">Amazon Labor Day sale</a> going on right now as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch Games on Sale at Best Buy Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of these six games on sale, the one that I'd recommend the most is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. This is a remake of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door">original GameCube game</a>, and it's fantastic. I played it when it first came out all of those years ago and loved it enough to spend full price on the Switch remake. If you haven't played it before, I highly recommend picking up a copy. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">IGN's review of this game</a> aligns with my feelings as well, with the reviewer calling it "an amazingly loyal and visually dazzling remake of a treasured RPG."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My second recommendation here is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>. This is another remake of a classic game, but it's still quite wonderful. I didn't get the chance to play the original 1993 version, so the Switch remake was my first dip into this story. While it's certainly not as visually stunning as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-zelda-games-on-nintendo-switch">other Legend of Zelda Switch games</a> like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it's fun and just challenging enough to hold your attention. Link's Awakening is also eligible for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-games-free-switch-2-upgrade">free Switch 2 upgrade</a>, so it's worth grabbing for the new Nintendo console too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership is currently included in these discounts. While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">IGN's review of this game</a> revealed a pretty disappointing score, I still picked up a copy and played it all the way through. It isn't as good as some of the other Mario &amp; Luigi games that made me fall in love with the series, but it's still quite a bit of fun. It's also the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">latest Mario game for the Switch</a> if you don't count Mario Kart World. I can't say I'd recommend paying full price for it, but with the $20 discount, I think it's worth a look for any Mario fan out there.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">See the full Best Buy Labor Day sale</h3><div catalogid="a264a67f-6640-443b-a515-0079f073a486" id="227277"><div id="227277" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Best Buy Labor Day Sale</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of these Nintendo Switch game deals, Best Buy has a wide range of discounts on other tech items.
