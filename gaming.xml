		<p>Hangar 13 and 2K have announced that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8th for PS5, PC, Xbox Series XS, and NVIDIA’s GeForce Now. To mark this news, a new gameplay trailer for Mafia: The Old Country has been released, and it shows shootouts, stealth attacks, car chases, and horseback chases with more shootouts thrown in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KTmJDf6CuZs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar&nbsp;<em>Mafia</em>&nbsp;gameplay,” said Hangar 13 President Nick Baynes. “That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi’s crime family.”</p>
<p>Unlike previous Mafia games that were set in the US, Mafia: The Old Country takes us to the very beginning of the Mafia and its base in Sicily. Enzo Favara is a brand new protagonist in the series and with the time setting, we will not see any of the characters from previous titles as most of them haven’t been born yet. In addition to the gameplay trailer, Hanger 13 has also released some developer insights that you can watch too. This video focuses on how the studio created the setting for the story of Mafia: The Old Country.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-revenue-and-profits-soar-ahead-of-big-year.1184508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released its financial statement for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, and revenue and profit are both up for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher.</p>

<p>Per the company's latest presentation, revenue across all sectors jumped by 17% this year, while operating profit rose by 27%. In the "Digital Entertainment" sector (which covers Konami's video game business), revenue was up by 22.5%, while profit grew by 24.7%.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2025/en0508_28h9rg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Konami attributed its success this year to the successful release of Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">sold two million copies</a> at last count. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another new game</a> based on a Konami IP, although it's unclear whether that IP is&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=juKP9QPx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-financials.jpg?itok=SVOnP7Z7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has contributed to a strong year for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The company also points to the recent release of remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yu-gi-oh-early-days-collection-pc-and-switch-release-date" rel="nofollow">launch of retro museum title&nbsp;<em>Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection</em></a>, which features 14 "nostalgic classic digital titles", as Konami says.</p>

<p>Sadly, Konami doesn't reveal any sales figures for these collections, so we don't know how well they're doing. We do, however, know that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">brand new&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game is in development</a>, albeit a mobile RPG that will almost certainly feature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it's looking like a pretty packed year by Konami's standards. In the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">next few months</a>, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic with a new visual makeover and some hefty gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>Konami also says it's "committed to the development" of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, although the studio stops short of revealing a release date or even a release window for the game.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> will release on August 8th, developers Hangar 13 and publishers 2K Games have confirmed, and look, here’s a trailer featuring much headlong bloodshed in the villas, citrus groves and *squints* mysterious firelit dungeons of early 20th century Sicily.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> now releasing in 2026, the new Mafia is the criminal enterprise to beat this year. Rather than trying to fill the hole left by the Rockstar colossus, it’s playing things small with “a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay,” according to Hangar 13 president Nick Baynes.

<p>
As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Eurogamer</a>, 2K Games and parent company Take Two Interactive are positioning the new Mafia as a side dish for the enormous live service productions that have become triple-A publishing's stock in trade.
</p>
<p>
“We think there’s a large audience for compelling stories that don’t require massive time commitments,” said 2K president David Ismailer in a release. “We’re excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis.”</p>
<p>Good lord, I remember when accidentally uttering the word “linear” in a press release or interview for a big-budget action game was the kiss of death. You’d find torch-waving gamer mobs at your gates the next day. That era has passed below the horizon: we are older now, and full of woe. We crave the sweet succinctness of a mildly interactive corridor.
</p>
<p>
It’s definitely a tapdance, openly selling your game as a “complement” for other games - possibly the devs at Hangar 13 find the language here a bit condescending. My somewhat more depressing analysis is that The Old Country is effectively being offered as a holiday from those games. You've done your time at the seasonal content coalface, so off you go to Sicily for some highly scripted R&amp;R.</p>
<p>Personally, I’m less bothered by questions of length than by the fact that The Old Country seems quite formulaic and lumbering. Guy shoots guy. Guy shoots guy while hunkered down behind table. Guy drives car very fast. Guy stabs guy. I do like the environments, though – hopefully, Hangar 13 have baked in plenty of opportunity to just wander through the groves looking at trees and whatnot.

            <p>Paradox have announced grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a>, following some teasers last week. It's the next big entry in the series of complex globe-spanning historical simulations, and having played a little as the hapless ruler of Korea in the 14th century, I can confirm that it is so far as chunky, complicated, and deep as usual. The changes in this sequel won't look wild or revolutionary to a dabbler, but seasoned tyrants might find a lot to pique their interest. Come see a trailer below.</p>

<p>The developers announced the game in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaZcN-eVta8">a recorded broadcast</a> and you can see it now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/">on Steam</a>. If you're already sold on the idea of carving up England into easily digestible chunks, and simply want to read about every little detail, then just go straight to my other article that describes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">everything we know about Europa Universalis 5</a>. It's big, but it's the most comprehensive summary of the game you'll find anywhere, or your florins back.</p>
<p>For everyone else, here's the skinny version. Europa Univarsalis 5 has been in development for the past few years at Paradox Tinto, a studio based in Spain. It's been called "Project Caesar" until now in an <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/">ongoing development diary</a>, but it was clearly a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> game to anyone who looked at the screenshots included in those dev posts. Over the past year, the developers have shared a lot of info on the historical map 'em up's new features.</p>
<p>In its broadest strokes, this is still a game of painting in the map your favourite colour and marching armies across land that's not yours to the chagrin of your neighbours. The twist this time is that you'll have to keep four competing interest groups happy throughout your rulership: the commoners, the clergy, the nobility, and the burghers. </p>
<p>These "estates" are roughly based on the political idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estates_of_the_realm">the estates of the realm</a>. Annoy the peasants too much and they'll start to get rebellious. Irritate the nobility and you'll have trouble leveraging them for their military power. That sort of thing. If you've played swipey kingdom management game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reigns">Reigns</a>, you'll get the idea. Except, of course, this will be much more finicky. As the crown, it's your job to placate peasant, prince and priest. The satisfaction levels of the estates will always be visible at the top of the screen.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One other big change is that the game will feature "pops", like in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/victoria-3">Victoria 3</a> - the little units of people who work, migrate, and die in your armies. And they'll have needs that must be met, usually in the form of certain trade goods as common as wheat or as precious as gems. Other than that, there are "Ages" that you pass through in certain eras (the Renaissance or the "Age of Absolutism", for example) and named characters like kings, artists, and ministers are a little more prominent than before. </p>
<p>I've been playing an early build of the game and it is quite the monster. Granted, I'm much more of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> guy, but I can appreciate the vast and intricate machinery of a Europa Universalis. It is overwhelming in places so far (they haven't implemented a tutorial yet) and quite demanding of my PC given all the calculations happening. But this is sometimes the case with Paradox grand strategy, and I have spent a few afternoons as the frowning ruler of Korea struggling under the whip of imperial China but building a beautiful road network in the process. Pity about all the smallpox.  </p>
<p>There's no release date yet. But I'll share more impressions over the coming days, but for now, grab a very large cup of tea and make your way through my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">exhaustive guide post</a>. </p>
<p>The previous game, Europa Universalis 4, has been out for over a decade now, spawning dozens of DLC packs and getting countless updates. It's one of our readers' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-50-favourite-strategy-games-of-all-time">best strategy games of all time</a> and the only game I have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kings-of-the-castle-europa-universalis-part-1">seen played in an actual castle</a>. "EU IV is a fascinating simulation, an alternate history generator, a narrative tool and an entirely successful redesign of a strong formula," wrote Adam (RPS in peace) in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-europa-universalis-iv">olde reviewe</a>, written in approximately 1342. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date was not announced. <span id="more-964121"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Almost five hundred years of history unfold before you in <em>Europa Universalis V</em>, the latest version of one of the greatest <a title="Genres > Strategy [242 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> of all time. Guide the destiny of any of hundreds of nations and societies in a simulated living world of unparalleled depth and complexity.</p><p><em>Europa Universalis V</em> builds on the franchise’s core concept of developing and advancing nations from around a deeply researched historical world, adding more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revised military system and greater logistical depth that will challenge even the most experienced strategy gamers.</p><p><strong>Watch History Unfold Before You</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Rule a land of your choosing. Hundreds of nations are yours to command, as you guide the destiny of millions of people through the late Middle Ages up to the Age of Revolution—from the mighty Yuan Dynasty to the city-states of Italy, from the warring clans of feudal Japan to the Pope himself.</li><li>Decide which course your nation will take. Historical events and situations await as you chart a unique path through a new history written by your decisions. <a title="Companies > Experience [211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> The Hundred Years’ War, the Protestant Reformation, the collapse of old dynasties and rise of new ones.</li><li>Explore alternate histories as you shape the world to meet your ambitions. What if England succeeded in pressing its continental claims? What if China pursued an overseas empire? What if Mongol supremacy in Russia persisted? Every <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> opens the possibility for an original history.</li></ul><p><strong>Prove Your Mettle as a Ruler</strong></p><ul><li>Impose domestic peace in a divided realm. Keep your nation’s factions in line as Estates jockey for power in your nation. Offer privileges to one group of citizens while you limit the power of another, all in the service of keeping your population under control.</li><li>Negotiate your way through an uneasy peace. Use diplomacy to entrench your dynasty across realms or build an invincible alliance. But remember that nations have no permanent friends—only permanent interests; so use your ambassadors carefully. Exact favors from friends, send threats to enemies, and keep an eye on everyone in-between.</li><li>Conquer new lands to expand your borders. Wage War on those who impede your ambition in a completely new <em><a title="Games > Europa [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/europa">Europa</a> Universalis</em> military system. Start in the age of levies and mercenaries and, through social development, evolve to vast standing armies and impenetrable fortresses. Choose skilled commanders to oversee both land and naval forces.</li></ul><p><strong>Develop Your Society</strong></p><ul><li>Build a strong economic infrastructure in the most detailed trade system yet seen in a <em>Europa Universalis</em> game. Dozens of goods and crops are available for production and trade on a map filled with new riches to discover. Invest in feeding a growing population or trade your surplus to less bountiful societies.</li><li>Mold your society to meet the historical moment. Choose your societal values, with new options opening as the ages move on. Centralize power at court or share it with your nobles. Pursue a tolerant policy for all faiths or condemn heretics. Emphasize massed armies or an elite cadre of quality soldiers.</li><li>Govern a nation composed of many cultures and faiths in a detailed <a title="Genres > Simulation [737 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of the past. For the first time in <em>Europa Universalis</em>, populations are represented on the map in detail, so provinces may be divided by religion or culture. Your decisions will determine how these populations will fare under your leadership.</li></ul><p><strong>Be Ambitious</strong></p><ul><li>Prevail in the greatest strategic challenges of the past. Test your expertise in grand strategic planning on a worldscape larger and more detailed than seen in any previous Paradox Interactive game. Challenge yourself to outdo the most famous rulers of the past, eclipsing their grand accomplishments and building your own vision of a richly detailed globe.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and presentation below.

                <p>This summer, the sequel to Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>-- will continue the story that began in the first game. But if there's ever a Death Stranding 3, Kojima has no intention of making the game himself.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-he-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-hes-not-going-to-make-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Kojima noted that he's already put some thought into what Death Stranding 3 would be. But despite having those ideas in mind, he would prefer to pass off the next game to someone else.</p><p>"If I use this Plate Gate concept, I could make endless sequels," noted Kojima. "I, of course, don't have any plans to do that, but I already have a concept for another sequel. I am not going to make it myself, but if I passed it on to someone else, they could probably make it."</p><p>In the world of Death Stranding, a Plate Gate is apparently some kind of portal that can transport people from continent to continent. It's a system that Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus) uses in Death Stranding 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT_A2gPhTIw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eT_A2gPhTIw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kojima recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-how-kojimas-experience-with-covid-impacted-the-game/1100-6531399/" data-ref-id="1100-6531399">the sequel was inspired by the COVID pandemic</a>, and one of the game's themes explores why it may have been a bad idea for so many people to connect with each other. Kojima told VGC that there's a lot of foreshadowing in the game that will reveal the reasons why Death Stranding 2's tagline is "We should not have connected."</p><p>"Even throughout the game, you see strands from many people, like Dollman and the mech soldiers," said Kojima. "Those are all hints. When you really start thinking about what it means to connect, you start to wonder… That's all I'll say for now."</p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on PlayStation 5 on June 26. A Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/" data-ref-id="1100-6531400">limited-edition DualSense controller</a> will be released on the same date.

            <title><![CDATA[Healers In Marvel Rivals Went On Strike]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/healers-in-marvel-rivals-went-on-strike.1184484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/marvel-rivals-healer-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <em>Marvel Rivals</em> match loads. In the time it takes you to blink, four of your teammates have instalocked their hero picks. There’s a Wanda, a Wolverine, a Psylocke, and one Spider-Man. The fifth player’s cursor is also hovering over Spider-Man, but they weren’t fast enough to pick him. A flurry of stars descends from the team chat. The other Spider-Man, bold yet seemingly lost in the match-wide chat, cries out: HEALS???</p><p>You could pick a Strategist, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ version of a healer, and help your pals out, since most viable team compositions that effectively keep a squad’s health topped up have a minimum of two healing characters. Spider-Man 2 hasn’t settled on a character yet.</p><p>Oh, nevermind. They’re going Black Widow, otherwise known as the hero with the worst win rate. You sigh and pick Punisher, the sixth DPS on the roster.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Toxicity is inevitable in most multiplayer games, especially in hero-based shooters, where the glory of high kill-death ratios seduces players into believing they are the only main character. Yet in April, radiation levels in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> became nuclear. For weeks, players reported that many of their superhero matches had become tortuously devoid of support characters. Healers had reached a breaking point. A “strike” had begun.&nbsp;</p><p>The exact start of the healer exodus is difficult to pinpoint. Some attribute it as a reaction to comments made by the top Spider-Man player in the world, a content creator known as Necros. Midway through April, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@roballenent/video/7493029469721087263" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video began floating</a> around where the bespectacled streamer called Strategist roles “easier by order of magnitudes” compared to damage-dealing roles. The incendiary clip went on to decry support skill floors as so low that Necros would need multiple books to capture the extent of his sentiment.</p><p>Except Necros wasn’t talking about the current season of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in that footage, he was talking about how the role felt when the game was initially released. The clip was taken out of context on sites like TikTok and Twitter, where enraged Strategists responded to it by declaring that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wrldkailee.plays/video/7496941646328646943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they would stop</a> playing the role entirely. A few viral clips like these amassed millions of views, which may have contributed to the perception that it all trailed back to Necros. But as he says in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iav0I-8c5N0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a video breaking down why he got “cancelled</a>” over his negative Strategist comments, millions of people play <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. A fraction of them probably engage in anything related to the game on social media, and an even smaller percentage of those players probably watch Necros to begin with. Even in a clip where he’s shit talking Strategists more directly, it’s in response to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1FxkPCzRWM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a thread that mentions him by name</a>, not an unprovoked comment.&nbsp;</p><p>But Necros made for a perfect villain in the larger narrative. He is, after all, the best Spider-Man player around. And nobody likes Spider-Man except other Spider-Man players: Either he’s terrorizing your back lane or he’s going 0-11 and never gracing the objective with his presence. The anti sentiment is so pervasive that most ranked matches will immediately ban Spider-Man even if it means screwing over their own teammates. Strategists in particular abhor Spider-Man: the hero can swiftly one-shot most fragile characters and leave the premises before anyone even notices.</p><figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals</figcaption></figure><p>Curiously, there’s a thread with over 700 upvotes on Reddit where a healer strike was actively called for that was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1jbz646/fellow_healers_im_calling_for_a_strike/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drafted two months ago</a>. It describes an apparent incident where a support player used the in-game report system to alert the developers of a death threat, only to be met with inaction. Frustrated, the Redditor encouraged other fellow supports to abstain from playing until toxicity conditions for Strategist players improved.&nbsp;</p><p>“Treat your healer, and fellow players, with RESPECT,” the post demanded. “Stop blaming healers every time you die. Stop blaming healers when you walk into a 5v1 and get melted. Stop saying ‘gg heals’ when you’re a 3 and 8 diving DPS. Stop saying ‘not enough heals!’ while not switching to healer yourself.”</p><p>While the Reddit thread is almost entirely absent from conversations about the strike, the event didn’t quite come out of nowhere. Demoralizing as it may be, everything that the thread described will sound familiar to anyone who has ever played a support role in a multiplayer game. By and large, healing characters are undervalued by selfish teammates who do not seem to understand the concept of a cooldown or why a healer may not be able to be in multiple places at once. Support players tend to bear this treatment for the greater good; it’s difficult to win a match if you can’t stay alive.</p><p>A patch that arrived with the latest season made things even worse. <em>Marvel Rivals</em> has never been a game that prioritizes “balance” or esport viability. NetEase has made it clear <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/we-balance-for-fun-first-and-foremost-marvel-games-executive-producer-discusses-marvel-rivals-priorities-and-why-competitive-balancing-comes-second/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that their focus is on keeping the game fun</a>, which in practice means that the hero shooter is wildly unfair. Spider-Man is but one patch in a larger tapestry of bullshit that includes features like “characters who do not even have to perceive you to kill you in seconds.”&nbsp;</p><p>Still, there’s a limit to how far you can push a chaotic design ethos like this. In games like <em>Fortnite</em>, players accept the brutality of dying with nothing more than a gray pistol to a lucky player who found a golden bazooka because they know that eventually, the lady luck will shine will grant <em>them </em>a bazooka instead. Everyone gets to be a menace, you just can’t be a menace all the time.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>Marvel Rivals</em> patch that dropped in early April made playing a Strategist into an even rawer deal. Some Strategists had to wait longer before they could use their abilities, while others saw a reduction in their overall health. Making things worse, the patch also tweaked how the game tabulated end-of-match awards. The aim was to reward players in accordance to their specific contribution to the match; the better you did, the more rank XP you’d gain.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a great idea in theory, except that the game’s rubric didn’t account for how a Strategist might contribute to a match. After the patch hit, Strategists reported winning matches and only seeing their points go up by 10, a fraction of what they’d normally get before. Even if the Strategist was instrumental to the team’s performance, it would take winning ten matches before you might rank up.</p><p>The downsides, at this point, were insurmountable. Strategists started posting on social media that they were joining the strike in solidarity with other supports. In doing so, some even discovered that they were better at dealing damage than they realized. They had no intention of going back now.</p><p>“Playing support is not a lot of fun anymore,” said a player named Lucas, who <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yonsidelucas/video/7496243346877369646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted a video with 1.8M views about his decision to join the strike on TikTok</a>.&nbsp; “There’s only eight options to choose from, and five of them got a nerf in the most recent update. I mean, poor Mantis mains have gotten a nerf every single update since the game came out,” he explained in the video.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Marvel Rivals</figcaption></figure><p>In some ways, the strike is a misnomer. There was no centralized movement, and while some people stopped playing the role, there were plenty of Strategists who agreed with everything people were complaining about yet kept chugging along. Perception may have also been skewed by the fact that support has never been a popular role. Even before the patch hit, it was common to see it take the entire pre-game timer before two people reluctantly picked a support character to play. I’ve been in my share of matches where nobody picked Strategist until well into the match, when things were dire and losing seemed inevitable. Every so often, you’ll get a match where only a single person valiantly picks up the mantle.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if it wasn’t exactly a strike, there was still a list of demands. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xiblankx/video/7497714261997751594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another video posted in late April</a>, a Twitch streamer named BlanK posted footage where he broke down each point strikers were fighting for–some reasonable, others bordering on parody. For example, one demand was that rather than having the entire team vote on which character got banned from the match, Strategists would get the first ban pick to themselves. A more sensible demand called for a shift in the tone whenever players interacted with Strategists, like making sure to thank them when they healed you. <em>Rivals </em>includes<em> a </em>chat wheel option to say Thanks, but it’s not an option included by default–and most players may never realize it’s there at all.&nbsp;</p><p>As word spread about the strike, what started as a fringe concept became mainstream discourse. Necros may not have lighted the fuse, but a week into the patch, at least some players experienced abuse <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1k5vjdy/the_support_strike_and_necros_comments_why_this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the strike was actively mentioned</a>. Many of the incidents attributed to Necros’ influence sound awful, but they’re also typical for anyone playing a Strategist. DPS players would routinely try to lobby their entire team to report a fellow teammate for “throwing” simply because the healer didn’t behave like their personal butler throughout the match.&nbsp;</p><p>The ruckus reached a fever pitch on April 30th, which pushed NetEase to address the situation with <a href="https://marvelrivals.gg/marvel-rivals-version-20250430-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another patch</a>. This one focused almost entirely on Strategists, who saw buffs that improved abilities or increased damage. Hilariously, one of the few DPS characters mentioned in the patch is every Strategist’s bane of existence, Spider-Man. The spandex-wearing nightmare now has a slightly smaller radius for his dreaded combo.</p><p>Amid this good news, NetEase not only sounded sympathetic to the woes of support players, the developers appeared to throw shade in the direction of players who berate Strategists for poor gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>“Strategists face increased pressure, needing to monitor teammates' health closely while carefully using their key abilities and being mindful of their positioning on the map,” the blog post reads. “Meanwhile, Vanguards and Duelists must not only attack effectively but also provide better protection for their Strategists to achieve victory.”</p><p>Necros, on the other hand, still finds himself battling an inaccurate narrative about his role in the fiasco. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iav0I-8c5N0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a video</a> posted at the end of April, the influencer says that while he doesn’t feel responsible for what happened, he understands why things transpired the way they did. Who wants to get MVP on a match only to barely rank up? The world’s best Spider-Man has also been slightly vindicated after everything is said and done. Necros has spent much of his time in May trying to prove his naysayers wrong by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1ke8ufi/necros_climbs_to_plat_only_playing_support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing entirely on Strategist gameplay</a>. His goal is to reach one of the highest possible ranks in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> using only support roles. He’s already gloating about having an extended winning streak in a role that detractors swore he’d never played.</p><p>Surely such antics aren’t winning Necros any sympathy relative to the amount of backlash he’s received in the wake of the strike. Then again, it was silly to insinuate that one of the best <em>Marvel Rivals </em>players in the world could never be good at a specific role in the game. Whether or not an average person would be able to ascend the ranks nearly as quickly is another story. Ultimately, the skill ceiling for any given character in the game is immaterial without a well-coordinated team.&nbsp;</p><p>A few days into the patch, it’s difficult to say whether or not the new changes are tangibly making a difference. Some Strategists may be overjoyed at their newfound power, sure. But no percentage change can undo the lobotomy of wondering why a support didn’t dutifully follow someone into the thick of the enemy spawn. The best we can hope for is that the Punisher crashing out on voice chat will eventually seek out a therapist.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-iv-max-traffic-speed-tom-walker-finished"><h3>He Did It</h3></a><p>Far and away the biggest Grand Theft Auto-related news of the day</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/valve-issues-cease-and-desist-to-counter-strike-classic-offensive-mod-team-after-previously-giving-approval-shutting-down-8-years-of-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve has issued a cease and desist order to the team behind the Counter-Strike: Global Offensive mod, Classic Offensive, after having previously approved the mod 8 years prior.</p>
<p>In a lengthy statement published to the mod team's official <a href="https://x.com/csco_dev/status/1920189873488642332">X</a> account, the Classic Offensive team warns mod creators that they "<em>should reconsider how they see Valve: a company that benefits from community creativity while being able to shut down years of work without warning, despite going through their defined process which they can drastically change at any time.</em>"</p>
<p>Valve gave the project the green light in 2017, according to a <a href="https://classic-offensive.net/#/timeline">timeline</a> the Classic Offensive mod team has created on their website. After years of little to no communication from Valve, in January 2025, the Classic Offensive app was rejected by Valve with the only explanation being "<em>we found that your app is not a good fit for Steam</em>."</p>
<p>After that, the team worked to try and find out what Valve meant by Classic Offensive not being a good fit, reaching out to Valve to no avail. The cease and desist order came through just hours before the team intended to update the mod through ModDB.</p>
<p>"<em>As we prepared to update via ModDB instead,</em>" the Classic Offensive team's statement reads, "<em>we received a cease and desist notification from Valve's socials just hours before launch. In follow-up communications, they clarified that releasing Classic Offensive would be distributing 'derivative content' based on their intellectual property, which is not permitted under the Steam Subscriber Agreement</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>The statement goes on to call out the narrowing conditions for what mods based on Valve's games are allowed and how, in the view of the Classic Offensive team, the company's current interpretations of what's allowed go against the culture around modding that Valve has benefited from for years and Valve's approval of the project in 2017.</p>

<p>It's unfortunate for the mod team and those who were looking forward to Classic Offensive that Valve has seemingly changed its mind about what it wants to allow at the last minute, and it also puts into question other mods, particularly the recently revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/cs-legacy-a-fan-made-standalone-remake-of-counter-strike-is-in-the-works/">CS: GO Legacy project</a>.</p>

			<p>The Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes that can be downloaded online don't bring any significant improvement, a recent analysis highlighted.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at some of the mods available for the remaster of the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda, starting with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/51230" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oblivion BSA Uncompressor</a>. The mod, which showed promise because it eliminated a CPU task, was developed for the original Oblivion, but it also works in the remaster, as it ships with the original Oblivion assets. The installation procedure isn't very simple, requiring the user to manually uncompress files as well, but the efforts should be worth it, as it's been claimed it does improve performance.</p>
<p>However, all the effort required to install this mod isn't really worth it for Oblivion Remastered. In their test, Digital Foundry highlighted how, while there's a minimal variance at the beginning of a session, the differences eventually become equal. The difference between the five-minute-long benchmark runs set around the Imperial City was less than 2%, and it doesn't eliminate the issue, as it doesn't address the variance that makes the experience feel choppy.</p>
<p>Besides checking out if the Oblivion BSA Uncompressor indeed solves stuttering issues in Oblivion Remastered, the tech experts also looked at the many engine configuration tweaked files that are usually shared after an Unreal Engine game launches. Looking at the most popular tweaked engine configuration file available from Nexus Mods, the tech experts highlighted how many of the changes don't actually mean anything for a shipped game, such as turning off logging, and how the tweaked file effectly does nothing for performance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Do Oblivion Remastered PC Anti-Stutter Fixes Do Anything?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSQ5T32d3Lo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Oblivion Remastered unofficial anti-stutter fixes not really doing anything, it will be up to Virtuos to fix the game's performance, which is one of the biggest issues of the remaster.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-sales-up-this-year-as-profits-nearly-double.1184454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking up for the Japanese publisher when compared to last year.</p>

<p>In its statement, Bandai Namco reveals that its net sales have risen by 18% this year, and that operating profits are up by nearly 100%, having risen from 90 billion yen in the 2023-24 period to 180 billion this year.</p>

<p>The company's success comes after a couple of big hitters performed very well indeed. Fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, for instance, hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">five million sales</a>&nbsp;within around four months, while&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">reached the same milestone in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=ZWv0V6jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=wwjY4CwV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC contributed to a good year for Bandai Namco.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million sales mark</a> recently, and while this was revealed too late to be part of the 2024-25 fiscal year, it still indicates that the base game has been selling steadily over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>These figures have helped to compensate for what was a pretty egregious failure on Bandai Namco's part in the form of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which sold poorly on release last year, causing developer Reflector Entertainment (which is a Bandai Namco subsidiary) to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of what lies in Bandai Namco's future, the company has reason to be optimistic about the next twelve months as well. Later this month, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>alongside FromSoftware, and if the base game's sales figures are anything to go by, Bandai Namco could well have another hit on its hands.</p>

<p>A third game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">due to be released this year</a>, and it'll be the first title in the series not to be developed by Tarsier Studios, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey" rel="nofollow">working on its own horror game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-platformer-paperklay-is-a-little-bit-banjo-a-little-bit-littlebigplanet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> Paperklay has perhaps the least appealing protagonists I've seen in a game recently. I hate avian buddy duo "Chick &amp; Nugget" and all their works, beginning with the ghastly 3am pun that appears to have spawned them.</p>
<p>Look at that ampersand, dangling in the middle like a chunk of gristle. What an absolute crime against typography. And chickens. And platform game levels made of paper and card - you'd never put an <em>actual</em> chicken nugget on dioramas like these, the grease would ruin it. I also mistrust Chick's beady black eyes, and I can't abide the fact that Nugget is wearing a fragment of eggshell for pants. That's like a human child using a placenta as a necktie! Argh!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Anyway, none of that matters, because Paperklay looks to be an absorbing arts-and-crafty experience with large, transforming environments. It's got music from Banjo-Kazooie and Yooka-Laylee composer Grant Kirkhope and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonlighter">Moonlighter</a> composer Steven Melin. Banjo is definitely the right parallel here. Trailer, away!</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFwB0GLKmTw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The game launches on 27th May, and still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1350720/PaperKlay/">has a demo on Steam</a>. You can expect a familiar buffet of platforming moves - double-jumping, dashing, gliding and sprinting - plus platform puzzles that involve folding, unfolding and variously messing with the layout. There are solutions that, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fez">Fez</a>, rotate the entire landmass you're traversing, exposing new routes. Developer Kevin Andersson has been working on the thing for a tidy three years, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhyKev">documenting the development on his Youtube channel</a>. The latest press release estimates that the full game will last five to six hours.</p>
<p>Aside from upsetting me with its puns, Paperklay also reminds me that a lot of games now trade on fancy, tactile recreations of physical materials. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumino-city">Lumino City</a>, for example, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hirogami">Hirogami</a>, or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-trail">Paper Trail</a>, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> from just this morning.</p>
<p>All these gameworlds are exquisitely made - every object creased and cut and stamped and embroidered to perfection by the unseen hands of godly artisans. I think there's an opportunity here for an arts-and-crafts experience in which the world has been sellotaped and glued together by people with no artistic talent whatsoever. At school, I once tried to make a papier-mache sculpture of a majestic valley. When I came back the next morning, it had shucked off its wire support and curled in on itself like a dead cockroach. Give me a platform level set inside that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Combine with the void magic attack Stendahl, the Cheater, Shortcut, and Last Stand Luminas active, as well as the right stat allocations, and you’re off to the races.</p><p>Players have been experimenting around these key pillars of Maelle’s nuke build over the last week to keep upping the total damage output, going from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-I0xItu0Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over one billion damage</a></span> to over two billion, and eventually over three billion against certain enemies. Like <em>Diablo IV</em> and other buildcrafting-centric RPGs, a lot of <em>Expedition 33</em> damage modifiers stack, multiplying the damage output as you layer each new buff on top of the last. </p><p>Not surprisingly, developer Sandfall Interactive has been watching Maelle’s increasingly busted builds with great interest, and finally announced on Thursday that it’s going to put an end to the DPS race. “We hadn’t planned to make any balance changes this early—just bug fixes, unless something clearly stood out,” the studio posted on X. “Well, Stendhal did.”</p><p>It continued, “It was underwhelming for most of development, so in our final pre-release balance pass, we gave it a big damage boost—and clearly overdid it. It ended up overshadowing most other options.   We still want you to be able to break the game—and you absolutely still can—but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy.” Players have until a hotfix goes live on May 9 to have their remaining fun. </p><p>Not to worry, however. There’s still tons of other very busted builds in <em>Expedition 33</em>. While none scaled quite to the insane level of Maelle’s Stendahl nuke, they will still help players make short work of even the game’s toughest encounters, including the optional post-game boss fight against the 45 million HP Simon. An endgame Verso build is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;http://Verso Build&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://Verso Build" target="_blank">breaking 2.5 million damage per turn</a></span>. Not quite a god mode cheat, but close enough.</p><p> It sounds like Sandfall Interactive will be leaving those intact for now. After all, what’s the harm in letting fans go wild in a single-player RPG?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

An all-new <a title="Genres > Action [2,716 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>-horror entry into the classic franchise, <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition</em> transforms you into Zula Hendricks—the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani’s blacksite experiments—on a dangerous mission to investigate an SOS from the backwater planet Purdan, home to a long-defunct mining colony. With her ever-present synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled <a title="Genres > Stealth [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> and serious firepower at her disposal. With deeply personal stakes propelling both Zula and Davis deeper, they must plunge to the dark heart of Purdan to expose—but not unleash—the horrors lurking within.</p><p><strong>Part One of a Two-Part Story</strong></p><p>Zula’s Fight Begins Here: Part One of this gripping two-part story thrusts you into the violent world of <em>Alien</em>, where you will uncover the secrets lurking within the GES facility on LV-354, the enigmatic planet Purdan.

      </p></div><div><p>With winter over and spring in effect, publisher <a title="Companies > THQ Nordic [508 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic">THQ Nordic</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Grimlore Games [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/thq-nordic/grimlore-games">Grimlore Games</a> have officially delayed the Early Access launch of <em><a title="Games > Titan Quest II [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/titan-quest-ii">Titan Quest II</a></em> for <a title="Platforms > PC [23,086 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> from its <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/titan-quest-ii-launches-in-early-access-for-pc-this-winter">previously planned</a> winter release to summer. A full release will follow for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. <span id="more-964064"></span></p><p>Here is an message from THQ Nordic:</p><blockquote><p>Originally slated for a winter 2024 / 2025 release, <em>Titan Quest II</em> will now launch in Early Access in summer 2025. The decision comes in response to a crowded <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves.</p><p>The team at Grimlore expressed deep gratitude for the overwhelming response to their recent demo playtest. With thousands of players participating, streaming, and filling out surveys, over 92 percent rated their experience as positive or very positive. Particularly encouraging was the feedback from long-time <em>Titan <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a></em> fans, who praised the game for capturing the spirit of the original while pushing forward with modernized systems.</p><p>Players explored the game’s introductory chapter, choosing from dual <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>teries and facing off against the first boss, Appollonia the Terrible—a fight that turned out to be a fan favorite. Visuals and audio received standout marks, with average scores of 5.25 out of 6 and 5.16 out of 6 respectively, while exploration and environmental storytelling were frequently highlighted as memorable features.</p><p>That said, the team acknowledges areas that need refinement. Combat fluidity, ability aiming, and balance are already being addressed, and performance optimizations will continue. New improvements, including customizable control schemes and enhanced UI indicators, are already underway based on community suggestions.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Grimlore Games reaffirmed their commitment to delivering a true successor to <em>Titan Quest</em>, one that respects its legacy while evolving for a new generation of players. The developers are actively implementing feedback and fine-tuning features ahead of Early Access.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country will challenge rising game prices with an unexpectedly low price tag when it launches in three months on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new entry in the series developed by Hangar 13 will <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/mafia-the-old-country-launching-august-8-2025-debuts-official-gameplay-trailer-and-developer-insights-video">launch</a>, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/">rumored</a>, on August 8th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game's Standard Edition, as mentioned above, will challenge the trend of rising prices by launching for only $49.99. The Deluxe Edition, which will include a variety of bonus items - the Padrino Pack, featuring "Lupara Speciale" Shotgun, "Vendetti Speciale" Pistol, "Immortale" Charm, "Padrino" Outfit, "Stiletto Speciale" Knife, "Eckhart Speciale" Limousine and "Cosimo" Horse and Accessories, and the Gatto Nero Pack featuring the "Bodeo Nero" Pistol, "Velocità" Charm, "Gatto Nero" Racing Outfit and "Carozella Nero" Race Car - as well as digital bonus materials like a digital artbook and original score, will also be reasonably priced at $59.99. The pre-order bonus Soldato Pack featuring the "Soldato" Outfit, "Scannaturi Speciale" Knife, "Tesoro" Horse and Accessories, and "Lupara" Charm will be available for both editions of the game.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the official release date for Mafia: The Old Country, publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOIg2lFVsJE">a new trailer</a> for the game, which provides a good look at the gameplay, which does away with the open-world mechanics of previous entries in the series in favor of a more linear, story-driven experience. The developers will provide more information on the game later today during a PAX East panel. Once available, both the trailer and the panel can be watched below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K and Hangar 13 have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>release date, and just as we suspected, the latest entry in the long-running crime drama saga will be arriving in summer.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>arrives on August 8th, which is the release date that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">mistakenly leaked via Steam</a> back in April before being hastily removed from the page. Who'd have thunk it would turn out to be real?</p>

<p>In any case, the release date was revealed alongside a brand new gameplay trailer, and...well, yep,&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>sure does look like a&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>game, so you probably already know whether you'll like it or not.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=yVeTyffj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-driving.jpg?itok=E5nul8aN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>has plenty of activities that you'll be familiar with if you're a series fan.</figcaption></figure><p>Over the course of the trailer (which, disappointingly, does feature people speaking in thick Italian-accented English rather than Italian), we see plenty of the usual action-adventure staples; stealth, driving sequences, shootouts, and, of course, squeezing through narrow passageways.</p>

<p>We also see the player engaging in a knife fight with an opponent, as well as riding on horseback, so it looks like you won't just be traversing the Sicilian countryside in your ye olde 1900s car.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's a prequel to the first three&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games. Taking place in 1900s Sicily, it sees you playing as Enzo Favara, a man looking to make good with the Torrisi crime family after "a brutal childhood of forced labor".</p>

<p>Like previous&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>games, it looks like&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>is emphasizing its cinematic credentials, so don't expect any&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA</em>-style</a> emergent open-world shenanigans here. In fact, this one <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/faq/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">won't be open-world</a> like previous games in the series.</p>




<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/mafia-the-old-country/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 8th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-midnight-walk-review.1184382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-midnight-walk-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the beginning, the story goes, there was the Dark, and then there was Fire. In Judeo-Christian myth, the first thing that God does is make light to drive out the nothingness of the darkness. Much of human achievement is based on the harnessing of fire: the ability to cook food, to stay warm, and travel to space. Something to sit around and tell stories. The language of creativity is the language of the flame; inspiration is a “spark.” It was impossible for me not to think about this kind of stuff when I was playing The Midnight Walk, a dark puzzle-horror adventure with an eerie stop-motion animation style that demands comparison to Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas. But developer MoonHood Studios knows that fire doesn’t just light the way forward. It consumes, it burns, it destroys. And a lit match, beautiful as it is, can burn down the world if it's in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Midnight Walk isn’t mechanically complex, but its story goes places. As I walked through its stunning, often emotionally devastating world, I was mostly just happy to be walking the bleak road it laid before me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its eight-hour journey opens with your character, the Burnt One, rising from a grave and accepting eyes and ears from another creature to be able to see and hear. At first, your mission isn’t clear; you’re just trying to survive. The world of The Midnight Walk is a place of eternal night, stalked by crawlers – creatures with too many limbs, whose movement is staggered, stuttery, and wrong. You run from them, hide from them in wardrobes, close your eyes to remove doors. Light a match, light a candle, light the way. Close your eyes and listen, and something hidden might reveal itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your methods for interacting with the world are limited but consistent, and The Midnight Walk builds on them subtly, twisting them in interesting ways. A match can light a candle to solve a puzzle, but it can light your way, too. A wardrobe can hide you from the crawlers, and serve as a doorway between to other wardrobes. A gun that shoots matches can help light candles and solve puzzles from afar. Look something in the eye before closing yours, and you’ll open them to find the thing blocking your path is gone. The world tends to change when you aren’t looking, or you might have been transported. It’s simple stuff, but it’s interesting because of the ways The Midnight Walk constantly plays with the rules, modifying and adding and shaping new things atop the old, often in ways I didn’t expect (and don’t want to spoil here).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the gameplay, simple as it is, intrigues, even if there are stumbles on this journey. Sometimes, you’re forced into awkward “sneak away from the scary Crawlers and/or Grinners” segments, which can be frustrating, but checkpoints are generous and this is little more than an annoyance at worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Midnight Walk finds its soul when you meet Potboy, a small living piece of pottery capable of carrying fire – the most precious resource in a world without a sun. At first, Potboy is afraid of you, and who can blame him? The night is dark and hungry and wants to swallow him whole because the monsters like fire, too. They like the taste. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It constantly plays with the rules, adding new things atop the old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But once you get him to trust you — the way to a Potboy’s heart is through his stomach — the story really kicks in. Your job, as a Burnt One, is to escort him to Moon Mountain, where you might fix things to make a world not dominated by The Dark Itself. The story, of course, is more complicated than that. You’ll see many broken Potboys on your way, and several sarcophagi ready to resurrect you should you fall. It’s made clear that all of this has happened before, and all of it will happen again. If you’re careful and diligent you can suss out the truth of things, and whether or not all of this is worth it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a while, I began to worry when Potboy would run off or get ahead of me, or we were otherwise separated. He was my charge, yes, but he was also my companion, and this world was unkind. If nothing else, I wanted him to be okay. When you command him to light something or stand somewhere, it feels like he obeys because he trusts you – it’s the way he looks back, to make sure you’re still there and that everything's okay. I wanted to be worthy of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the things I admire most about The Midnight Walk is how unwilling it is to stop and explain things to you. The characters in this world speak to you like they live here, not like they’re dispensing lore to the uninitiated, and even the narration you’ll encounter is more concerned with telling a story than making sure you know what every word means. Understanding comes from paying attention, from finding the Shellphones scattered throughout the world, and listening to the stories stored in them. They often don’t tell you who is speaking. You have to figure that out for yourself. In doing that, you begin to understand what this world is, how it came to be this way, and your place in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where The Midnight Walk sings for me: In its story, and in its characters. Each one of them was modeled in real-world clay and crafting materials, then scanned in and animated to resemble traditional stop motion techniques. There are the two-headed Soothsayers who worship the Fire and try to guide you along its path, dispensing their wisdom before disappearing. The enigmatic Soulfisher, said to be older than almost everything meets you by any fire on the road, to offer companionship and advice. He seems like he’s waiting for something. Housy, your walking house, who serves as a companion, a home for the things you find, and a respite from The Dark Itself. And there are more – some you’ll meet long before you understand who they are or what they’re doing, and others will become old friends or strange, threatening acquaintances. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Midnight Walk sings in its story and in its characters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s how these characters interact, and the stories that you see as you travel toward Moon Mountain, that make The Midnight Walk memorable. A village of disembodied heads, defined by their past sins, hoping to avoid retribution. A creature, the last of its kind, consumed by grief. A town destroyed by a misplaced act of revenge, hoping to put its ghosts to rest. A little girl who lit matches because they reminded her of the stars. One of the stories, The Tale of the Craftman’s Heart, didn’t quite hit me as hard as the ones that preceded or followed it, mostly because the story is told to you rather than something you experience, but even that had its moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those stories, even when flawed, are what make this a game drowning in grief, loss, fear, and misunderstanding. This is a world whose boundaries are drawn by pain. You can make none of it right; the past is the past. But you can light a match and ease that pain, offer warmth and comfort to a soul in need. Potboy can help restore the fires that have gone out. Together, you can move the needle, just a little. You can bear witness. And these stories are worth hearing.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Puzzle Games</h3><p>I just reviewed The Talos Principle 2. Here's how it stacks up against my favorite puzzle games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We overuse, and often overvalue, the word “cinematic” when we talk about video games, but The Midnight Walk is cinematic in a way most games aren’t and few attempt. It doesn’t do this by reveling in dialogue or smothering you in cutscenes. Instead, it sets a scene, draws the eye, fools you into turning your gaze just so and allows you to feel that all of it is organically unfolding when in fact it has been carefully crafted to seem that way. It is one of the most visually arresting games I’ve ever played, but always in service to the story, the world, the characters. The Midnight Walk supports VR (via Steam VR or PlayStation VR2), and while I didn’t get to play it that way, I imagine it’s stunning. That said, there are times that The Midnight Walk limits how you can move so that it can present an image or a scene just so, and while I can't particularly fault what The Midnight Walk wants to show me, the loss of control and invisible barriers can feel weird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even its flaws, however, barely affected the way I felt when I saw both of The Midnight Walk’s endings, and the game itself. I vastly prefer one to the other, and I think anyone who sees both will know which I mean immediately. The world is more than it seems and this story is complex, and I feel only one reflects that. But the other feels so true, and my time with The Midnight Walk affected me so much that these flaws feel like roots you might trip over during a hike in the woods, or a pebble that worms its way into your shoe. Perhaps the experience is less for it, but it’s not what you’ll remember.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">I haven’t been able to stop thinking about The Midnight Walk since I saw its endings. It’s something I know I’ll come back to so that I can wander this dark world again. Not because I’m looking to complete a checklist, but because everything I’ve learned has recontextualized the emotional stories I saw and changed what I believed about the world. I want to hear the mournful, haunting music again, and spend more time by the fire with these characters. I want to travel with Potboy, my charge, my companion, my friend who says so much without ever speaking a word. The Midnight Walk is not long — I would put my playthrough at around seven or eight hours, and I took my time — but it is gorgeous and touching, and it took hold of me early and never let me go until I took the last step on my journey. It isn’t mechanically ambitious other than to play with perception in unexpected ways, and it challenged me to go into the dark unafraid, and find truth, and companionship, and I did. Out of darkness, light. One cannot exist without the other, and neither offers every answer. I lit a match, and found my way, and I was not alone.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has shared some new insight into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, saying COVID impacted the sequel. In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-talks-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-im-just-really-happy-we-can-finish-making-the-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kojima said the original Death Stranding, which was released in 2019, was made based on the theme of "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect."</p><p>Then the COVID pandemic began in 2020, after Death Stranding 2 came out. Having lived through the pandemic, Kojima said he's changed his way of thinking when it comes to connection.</p><p>"After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings [in Death Stranding 2]. I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="346302629" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

much so that he based some of the themes for Death Stranding 2 around it.</p><p>"We started working remotely, while concerts and live events vanished. We had no choice but to rely on the Internet. Children couldn't go to school or play and had to stare at screens all day," he said. "I think we didn't have any other choice at the time. You'd turn on the TV and hear about how the metaverse was the next big thing, but that isn't how human communication works. You don't meet people by chance that way."</p><p>Death Stranding 2 releases on June 26 for PS5.

            <p>FromSoftware owner Kadokawa hopes the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Nightreign</a>, as well as the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, will offset a projected decline in gaming profits this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The company has forecast a 60 percent decline in profits for its gaming segment for FY2025, owing to the huge success last year of Elden Ring and its DLC <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, according to the company's latest financial results.</p>
<p>However, the company hopes to "exceed the forecast with new hit titles and expanded sales of past titles" as it maximises the long-term value of Elden Ring.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is an online multiplayer co-operative spin-off with roguelite elements that sees players join forces to beat a host of Nightlord bosses. It releases on 30th May across PC, PS4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition will release later this year on Switch 2, though is currently without a firm release date, and will mark the game's debut on a Nintendo console. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">It will include two new classes</a>, new looks for the Torrent mount, and other additions that will also come to existing platforms in an update.</p>
<p>However, even with these releases, Kadokawa is expecting a big decline in profit.</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">hands-on with Elden Ring Nightreign</a> earlier this year and came away impressed with its twist on familiar Soulslike gameplay, despite not being a big fan of multiplayer in the past.</p>
<p>Despite positive criticism, excitement seems muted compared to the success of the base game. Yesterday, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-director-promises-difficulty-tweaks-following-beta-feedback-and-updates-for-nightlord-gladius">director promised tweaks to its difficulty following the network test</a> earlier this year.</p>
<p>Kadokawa also points to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods</a>, announced for Switch 2, as part of its longer term plan. It's a completely new game exclusive to Nintendo's new console that's expected to "further expand the global fanbase", although its multiplayer focus has raised concerns with fans alongside Nightreign's online play.</p>
<p>FromSoftware boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">Hidetaka Miyazaki confirmed the studio hasn't shifted to focus on multiplayer games</a>, despite that appearing to be the case with both Nightreign and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mafia: The Old Country will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 8th August, publisher 2K has now officially confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
This is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-inadvertently-revealed-by-publisher">the release date previously listed by 2K on Steam, before it was swiftly removed</a>. Still, it's nice to know the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 delay by fellow Take-Two company Rockstar</a> hasn't changed anything.
</p>
<p>
In a press release issued today alongside a gameplay trailer, below, 2K also revealed a £45/$50 price point for the game. Meanwhile, developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> set expectations that Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience - in other words, relatively short - and easily digestible alongside players' usual live-service diet.

"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," said 2K president David Ismailer. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis." 
</p>
<p>
In other words, don't stop playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> yet!
</p>
<p>
Set in Sicily - the aforementioned Old Country - back in the 1900s, this latest entry in the Mafia series has been angled as something of a return to franchise's roots after the more modern-era open-world <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>. First <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">announced last year at Gamescom 2024</a>, it's the next entry in the series from Mafia 3 and Mafia: Definitive Edition studio Hangar 13, and the first to make use of Unreal Engine 5.

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass">The Game Business</a> looked back on how Microsoft's decision to put <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on Xbox Game Pass panned out, and the results are, well, mixed. On the one hand, the decision does seem to have paid off for Xbox overall. On the other hand, it doesn't look like it really did anything for Call of Duty as a game.</p>
<p>When Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched, according to player numbers that The Game Business pulled from Ampere Analysis, 33.7 million people were playing Black Ops 6. That's a big, 13 million increase on the previous year's abysmal Modern Warfare 3, and a smaller, but still significant 2.5 million increase from the last strong Call of Duty release with 2022's Modern Warfare 2.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 drove a large spike in Game Pass subscriptions, it had more people playing Call of Duty on Xbox devices and platforms, and even though PlayStation's market share still towers over Xbox's, Call of Duty coming to Game Pass was able to keep team green in the game.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and the spike in Game Pass subscribers Call of Duty brought in has definitely helped the service, with an 11% increase in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024's first quarter, according to Circana. Players stuck around to enjoy the rest of what Game Pass has to offer, which is better for Microsoft and the entire Xbox ecosystem.</p>
<p>Those same players who joined Game Pass to play Call of Duty have seemingly not kept playing Call of Duty. The number of players on Call of Duty who were playing on Xbox when Black Ops 6 launched dropped 10%, and the Call of Duty player base has seen a sharp decline compared to the decrease following the launch of previous Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is still a massive game with over 20 million active players, but that player base is currently 20.6 million, according to Ampere Analysis, which sits slightly below the 20.8 million it was back in 2023.</p>
<p>More players than the series' last major release were playing Black Ops 6 when it launched, and months later, Call of Duty has fewer active players than it did two years prior. Adding Call of Duty to Game Pass helped Xbox boost subscribers, but hasn't helped its marquee series substantially grow.</p>
<p>Call of Duty is an Xbox first-party title, so what's good for Xbox is theoretically good for Call of Duty. But Call of Duty is arguably Xbox's most important series now, and it's not exactly the best sign for Xbox that adding its most important series to its core subscription service only helped one of those things grow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15m-switch-2-units-in-first-year.1184340/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the number of Switch 2 consoles it expects to sell within the machine's first year on sale, and it's safe to say the Japanese gaming giant isn't underselling its newest hardware.</p>

<p>In the company's financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, Nintendo reveals that it expects to shift a staggering 15 million Switch 2 units before April next year, which gives the console around nine months to achieve that figure.</p>

<p>Software-wise, Nintendo says it expects to sell around 45 million software units in that time as well. It's worth noting that this figure doesn't include original Switch games; Nintendo is expecting to sell a staggering 105 million of those before April.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ZbR9Ycrd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-first-year-15m-docked.jpg?itok=ndeuZnOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting to sell a heck of a lot of Switch 2 units.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's prediction is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> earlier this year, which stated that the company was preparing to ship "more than 20 million units" in the console's first year. That would give the Switch 2 an additional three months to reach the 20 million figure, which sounds about right.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, Nintendo also says it expects to sell about 4.5 million original Switch consoles this financial year. I suppose not everyone is going to flock to buy the newest machine, and there are still a few people left in the world who don't own a Switch.</p>

<p>Nintendo will no doubt be hoping that its predictions about the Switch 2 are correct, because sales aren't looking great. They're down 30% on last year, with profit falling 43% as well.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that the last twelve months haven't exactly seen a slew of high-profile first-party Nintendo releases to bolster sales, although&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</i>have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-nintendo-financials" rel="nofollow">certainly attempted to pull their weight</a> in this regard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=IHVDvREQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch-2-15m-units.jpg?itok=N-w02qgM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>wasn't able to save Nintendo from falling sales this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Nintendo is at the end of a console's life cycle, a drop in sales is also to be expected, and I'm sure the company isn't exactly quaking in its boots when the Switch 2's launch is just around the corner.</p>
