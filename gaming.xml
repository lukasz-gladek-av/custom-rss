You don't need yet <em>another</em> reason to pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, right? Well, you know us, we're here to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>GameStop has announced that it will be issuing a free tote bag (gasp!) for in-store pre-orders for Requiem on all available platforms. It depicts the ruined landscape of Racoon City with the game's title at the top. Form an orderly queue folks, come on now!</p>

<p>Look, to be serious for a moment, we know it's not the coolest pre-order bonus ever, but heck, it's free. For diehard fans of the series, it could be a cool little thing to hang off the end of a shelf, or something. We're grasping, sure, but still...</p>
<p>Regardless of where you wind up purchasing it, Resident Evil Requiem will launch on the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It sees the return of veteran Leon Kennedy and the introduction of FBI agent Grave Ashcroft, whose mother – Alyssa – was a key character in the classic PS2 title, Resident Evil: Oubreak.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025</link>
            <guid>1385941</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">pervasive layoffs</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">continued price hikes</a>, things didn’t go so well for Xbox in 2025. But even though Game Pass, the Xbox subscription service, isn’t quite the deal it once was, there are still a lot of excellent titles to check out. This was an especially good year for indie titles, with breakout hits like <em>Blue Prince</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> dominating much of the conversation. Here are the best things to check out right now.</p><p>Who the heck knows when Bethesda will finally release the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. But in the meantime, <em>Avowed</em> fills in that gap quite nicely. It’s a more contained fantasy RPG in terms of scale, but it’s still pretty big, and features a fascinating world to explore and combat that lets you mix and match with swords, guns, and magic. You can lose yourself in it without giving up all of your free time.</p><p>For some people, the idea of a game where you play as a sentient lighthouse solving puzzles in a world devoid of people is probably enough of a sales pitch. For everyone else, let me just say: <em>Keeper</em> is an incredible puzzle-platform game and unlike almost anything else I’ve ever played. Perhaps most impressive is that it’s constantly shifting, so that once you come to grips with its weirdo world, it changes into something new and different.</p><p>What really sets this action-adventure game apart is its distinct world. <em>South of Midnight</em> is set in the deep South, and weaves together Black and southern folklore and culture to create the kind of setting you almost never see in video games. On your quest you’ll fight various monsters and creatures in order to heal a blighted landscape, which involves wielding magic powers and partnering with a sentient stuffed toy.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837245/expedition-33-was-the-most-popular-third-party-game-on-game-pass-this-year-rightly-so">most popular games on Game Pass this year</a> seemingly came out of nowhere. Developed by a brand-new studio called Sandfall Interactive, <em>Clair Obscur</em> is built in the mold of classic Japanese role-playing games like <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but with a distinctly French sense of style. Its mixture of sweeping story, incredible soundtrack, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles">open-ended combat</a> helped it stand out in a very crowded genre.</p><p>More than a decade in the making, <em>Routine</em> is a harsh sci-fi horror game with a very old-school sense of style inspired by the <em>Alien </em>films. That means lots of chunky retrofuturistic gadgets to get your hands on, and a very bleak and terrifying moon base to explore — if you can summon the guts.</p><div><p id="fallout-4-anniversary-edition"><h2><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></h2></p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/844926/fallout-season-2-review-amazon-prime-video">The return of the <em>Fallout</em> TV series</a> means there’s a good chance you’ll be looking to explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland in video game form, too. This new edition of <em>Fallout 4</em> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/9/9693246/fallout-4-review-ps4-xbox-pc">which first released back in 2015</a> — brings together the base game and all of the previous DLC, but otherwise mostly leaves the experience intact. As they say, war never changes.</p><p>How much time do you have? Because the thing about <em>Blue Prince</em> is that, if it gets its hooks in you, it’s going to be very hard to put down. The architectural puzzle game has you exploring a vast mansion at the same time you build it, all in an attempt to uncover its secrets and find an inheritance you’re owed.</p><p>We called this “the feel-good game of the summer,” which should make <em>Wheel World</em> ideal for the gloomy and grey winter months. It’s an open-ended adventure where you bike your way through a fantasy world in order to perform an ancient ritual, which involves assembling a bicycle of legend. Mostly, though, it’s a peaceful way to take in some beautiful sights while speeding down the street.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/845376/xbox-games-pass-best-games-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There won’t be any prizes for correctly guessing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>’s first expansion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-big-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-flows-into-our-lives-for-free-next-year">Sea of Sorrow</a>, will involve a) a sea and b) some kind of adverse emotion. But there is mounting evidence that the watery DLC will restore, or at be inspired by, places and bugs that developers Team Cherry had previously left on Silksong’s cutting room floor – yet had been shown in in marketing for the main game as far back as 2019.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD0EZHwb9Zo">YouTube’s Hollow Knight loremaster Mossbag</a>, along with the loveable sickos that maintain the (non-Fextralife) <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)">Hollow Knight wiki</a>. Mossbag’s rain-lashed compass points towards Sea of Sorrows being at least partially based on <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)/Areas">Pharloom Bay</a>, which according to early development materials, would have been plopped at the far east of Silksong’s map, next to (eurghh) Bilewater. Pharloom Bay never made it into the game that finally released in September this year, but there is a distinctly nautical-lookin’ region shown at 1:13 in Silksong’s original reveal trailer, covered in barnacles and housing at least one conch-dwelling NPC:</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFAknD_9U7c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p>That area was never found in-game either, so it’s a pretty safe bet this was meant to be Pharloom Bay. And, as Mossbag notes, that old footage also shows the area being lit by distinct scythe-shaped bell lamps of an almost identical design to the lashed structures we see in the very first shot of Sea of Sorrow’s own teaser.</p><figure>
<p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDFEeeLy6ws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Pharloom Bay might not be the only resurrected concept, either. The mysterious, lightning-struck glass chamber shown halfway through the Sea of Sorrow trailer looks an awful lot like the Lifeblood Spire, another cut area that’s been documented since before Silksong’s release. Specifically, by helpful Australians, who <a href="https://x.com/arfa2706/status/2000736787040203098">snapped photos</a> of a Hollow Knight exhibit at Melbourne’s ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image) museum in Melbourne. That one never made it into a trailer so, y’know, cheers mates.</p>
<p>I absolutely don’t want to sound like I’m disdaining the practice of developers recycling ideas for DLC or expansions. If anything, it’s quite cool to see individual concepts float in and out of the gamesmaking process, and to wonder – aloud, sometimes – how they might’ve changed in the meantime. Silksong itself has another interesting example of this, which I’ll spell out if you don’t mind light spoilers. See the coral-coated, seemingly underwater environment at 0:23 in the reveal trailer? Seasoned skongers will know that colourful design only accounts for a tiny, optional segment of the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-act-3">infamously tricky final act</a>, but paying attention to lore snippets will reveal that Team Cherry reworked the wider region into the Sands of Karak: the same coral kingdom hinted at in the earlier trailer, but lost to time, dried out, and claimed by the desert.</p>
<p>Whether or not Pharloom Bay has been as drastically rejigged, Sea of Sorrow is currently aiming for release in 2026. Like the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>’s expansions, it’ll be free to owners of the base game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Rescues Your Christmas Gifts, Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle at Price That Crushes All Other Sets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-rescues-your-christmas-gifts-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-at-price-that-crushes-all-other-sets-2000654166</link>
            <guid>1385932</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO sets is a holiday gifting staple that works for kids and adults but as Christmas approaches, finding products that actually arrive before December 25th becomes increasingly critical. This <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> building set <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">currently sells for $140 on Amazon, down from its regular $169 price</a>, and more importantly, it ships with guaranteed delivery before Christmas through Amazon’s fast shipping network.</p>
<p>This 2,660-piece display model recreates the most iconic location from the Harry Potter universe in impressive detail which makes it perfect for adult collectors and Harry Potter fans.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full Castle Recreation with Amazing Detail</h2>
<p>The model shows how complicated the architecture of Hogwarts Castle is by including the <strong>Main Tower, Astronomy Tower, Great Hall, several courtyards, bridges, greenhouses, the Boathouse, and even the Black Lake</strong>. Each part fits together to make a complete picture of the castle grounds that matches the size and layout fans know from the books and movies.</p>
<p>The castle’s interior details make famous places come to life, like the <strong>Chamber of Secrets</strong> with its snake-shaped architecture, the Winged Key room from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges, the Potions Classroom where Snape scared students, and the Chessboard Chamber with its checkered floor pattern. These hidden details are worth looking for closely, and they add depth to the model beyond its impressive shape.</p>



<p>The grounds around the castle add to the experience by including important parts of the larger Hogwarts setting. The Durmstrang Ship is ready to take students who are visiting, and the Beauxbatons Carriage is a nice touch that fits with the story of the Triwizard Tournament. The Whomping Willow is standing there with its unique twisted branches, and the crashed Ford Anglia is nearby as a nod to Chamber of Secrets.</p>



<p>One of the best things about the model is how good it looks: When finished, <strong>it is over 8.5 inches tall, 13.5 inches wide, and 10 inches deep</strong> and the castle stands out on a shelf, desk, or display area without taking up too much space or needing a whole bookcase to hold it. The gold-colored Hogwarts architect statue mini-figure that comes with it is the icing on the cake, and the <em>“Hogwarts Castle”</em> nameplate makes it a collectible display piece.</p>
<p>You’re saving here almost $30 on a big LEGO set that has a lot of pieces and detail for the price. In this size range, LEGO sets that are similar to castles or buildings usually cost the same or more, so this deal is a good deal for adults who like LEGO and the promise of delivery before Christmas takes away the stress of ordering gifts so close to the holiday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As holiday gifts go, the best ones are the ones you can use for years on end. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6476/">So this amazing limited-time special offer from Rosetta Stone — a lifetime subscription marked down from $399 to just $149</a> — could be one of the best and most thoughtful presents you can give a friend or loved one this holiday season.</p>
<p>A lifetime subscription to the premier language learning app is the perfect answer to so many gift-giving challenges — from finally solving the person who says they don’t need anything to the fact that this is a gift where you don’t have to worry about shipping and arriving in time for the holiday. And it’s a full, comprehensive, one-time purchase that gives lifetime access to Rosetta Stone and all 25 languages it offers, along with any it adds in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6476/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Rosetta Stone</a></p>

<h2>Suitable for Everyone</h2>
<p>Young people who can get a headstart at becoming a polyglot and retirees who are traveling the world and eager to be conversant in the local languages are perfect Rosetta Stone gift subscription recipients. So is anyone and everyone in between, because the lifetime subscription means you can learn new languages at your own pace without fear of having to pay a renewal fee or losing access. Even for busy people with packed schedules, Rosetta Stone’s bite-sized lessons which can be as short as 5 minutes are perfect. You can stop lessons and then pick up where you left off anytime, because you can access Rosetta Stone on all of your devices.</p>
<p>Rosetta Stone’s been the most trusted name in language learning for over 3 decades, thanks to the wide array of languages offered and the way they are presented on the app. Rather than just learning object names and basic vocabulary without context, Rosetta Stone teaches phrases that are actually useful in real-life conversations. They’ve also added a TruAccent feature that listens to your pronunciation and gives you feedback to help you perfect every word and, if not sound like a local, come very close to it.</p>



<h2>Learn Before You Fly</h2>
<p>If you know someone who has a packed travel itinerary already planned for 2026. they’ll appreciate the gift of Rosetta Stone and the ability to prepare for their journey by learning the local tongue. Even in short sessions, Rosetta Stone’s proprietary Dynamic Immersion teaching method adds up quickly, and will have the user picking up more words and phrases and a deeper understanding of their language of choice than they would with any other learning program.</p>
<p>A lifetime subscription to Rosetta Stone is a thoughtful holiday gift with near-universal appeal, and one that will enrich whoever is lucky enough to receive it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6476/">Last-minute holiday shoppers should especially take note of this deal cutting the price of a lifetime subscription to Rosetta Stone from $399 all the way down to just $149</a>, because there’s no shipping to sweat over. The only thing to worry about is time, because this is a limited-time deal, and one you will not want to miss.</p>

              <p>The year is coming to a close. While you’re crossing off every name on your list of who you need to shop for this holiday season, make sure not to forget someone especially important—you. That’s right, you deserve a big upgrade this time of year. How about saying goodbye to slow, spotty internet with the help of a Wi-Fi 6E mesh network? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6467/">Right now, you can save as much as 40% on an eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router.</a> Individually, the router normally goes for $250, but the limited time deal has it marked down to just $160. You’ll save a solid $90.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi router’s real value lies in its ability to create a mesh network, which requires more than one router. Amazon offers these routers both individually and in bundled sets, including two, three, and four packs. Currently, these bundles are all heavily discounted. The two-pack, originally priced at $400, is now down to $240; the three-pack, originally $550, is now available for $330; and the four-pack, originally $800, has been reduced to $490. The best value right now is the three-pack, as each node costs just $110, making it the most affordable choice for expanding your network.</p>

<h2>Full Home Coverage</h2>
<p>Slow or unreliable internet can be incredibly frustrating, especially when you’re trying to load web pages or stay connected to your devices at home. A Wi-Fi 6E mesh network, like the eero Pro 6E system, can resolve these issues by providing consistent coverage. Each eero node covers up to 2,000 sq. ft. and can support more than 100 Wi-Fi-enabled devices. The system’s patented TrueMesh technology ensures that your network traffic is routed efficiently, reducing dead zones and drop-offs.</p>
<p>With a three-node setup, you’ll be able to cover up to 6,000 sq. ft., connecting over 300 devices simultaneously. If that’s not enough, you can easily add more nodes later on to further expand both your coverage area and device capacity.</p>



<p>With the addition of Wi-Fi 6E, which introduces access to the 6 GHz band. It operates as a third lane, separate from the traditional 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. You’ll experience faster speeds and improved performance across more devices. And setting up your mesh network is straightforward. The eero smartphone app provides step-by-step guidance to get your system up and running in no time.</p>
<p>In addition to excellent wireless coverage, three eero Pro 6E routers all together feature six built-in Ethernet ports, which can support speeds of up to 1 Gbps (1,000 Mbps). This makes them ideal for high-demand activities like streaming 4K video or playing cloud-based games. With the growing number of devices that support cloud gaming, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs, you can enjoy smooth gaming experiences without needing a physical console, thanks to the fast and reliable internet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-friendslop-rpgs-sales-2000654157</link>
            <guid>1385920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What were the most popular Steam games of 2025? Players have a sense based on Steam charts, general vibes, and what dominated conversations this year, but analyst Simon Carless recently shared official <em>GameDiscoverCo</em>. estimates for the top-performing games that show <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590">just how much RPGs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-roblox-cliff-knock-off-aggro-crab-2000614671">multiplayer games</a> reigned supreme.</p> <p>The latest edition of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/revealed-the-top-new-pc-and-console-58">his excellent newsletter</a> contains estimates for the top-20&nbsp;<em>new</em> games on Steam this year by both total sales and total revenue. Here’s the list of games with the most copies sold:</p> <blockquote><p>20. Revenge on Gold Diggers<br> 19. Borderlands 4<br> 18. Dispatch<br> 17. Mage Arena<br> 16. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered<br> 15. Split Fiction<br> 14. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2<br> 13. Stellar Blade<br> 12. Megabonk<br> 11. Elden Ring Nightreign<br> 10. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33<br> 9. RV There Yet?<br> 8. Escape From Duckov<br> 7. Hollow Knight: Silksong<br> 6. Arc Raiders<br> 5. Monster Hunter Wilds<br> 4. Schedule I<br> 3. Battlefield 6<br> 2. Peak<br> 1. R.E.P.O.</p></blockquote> <p>What stands out? Well, as Carless notes, the “<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/friendslop-peak-repo-fortnite-trend">friendslop</a>” like <em>Peak</em> and <em>R.E.P.O.</em> were huge, suggesting that many players do indeed just want to play games in which the co-op mechanics encourage goofing around with others. Multiplayer games in general were dominant, taking the six top slots. Fantasy RPGs were also super popular, with <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Deliverance 2</em>, and <em>Clair Obscur</em> all having strong showings. I also think it’s worth calling out <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> specifically. Both struggled with PC optimization and word-of-mouth probably did them no favors, but they landed spots here regardless. Even so, it’s surprising to see <em>Borderlands 4</em> <em>below</em> an episodic narrative game like <em>Dispatch</em>.</p>

 <p>This list is arranged by total sales though, and <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched at $70. When you look at the list of top 20 games by revenue instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> breaks into the top 10 and<em> Dispatch</em> (which is only $30) falls to number 19. That list is still very much skewed back toward 2025’s conventional blockbusters, with <em>Battlefield 6</em> at number 1. Clearly a big part of which games break out big time on Steam comes down to a lower barrier to entry. <em>Schedule I</em> is only $20, <em>R.E.P.O</em> is only $10, and <em>Peak</em> is just $8.</p> <p>Are games that engineer viral moments and encourage you to bully your friends into buying them the key to unlocking success on Steam, or has “friendslop” run its course? At the very least, these games are cheaper and quicker to make than MMOs, MOBAs, and RPGs, so we probably won’t have to put up with a bunch of knock-offs that missed the boat launching in 2028.</p>

            <p>AdHoc's superhero workplace comedy Dispatch has appeared rather unexpectedly on the Australian Nintendo eShop for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>According to the listings, Dispatch will be available on Switch consoles from 29th January, but can be pre-ordered now for $39.55 AUS.</p>

<p>I have just checked the eShop here in the UK, and at the time of writing Dispatch is not appearing in any of the search results. Rather, the main result was for SnowRunner - Season 5: Build &amp; Dispatch. The second result was for a game that places you in the role of an airport dispatcher (see image below).</p>
<p>It's a different story over on the Australian site, though, which currently states the Switch 2 edition of AdHoc's acclaimed Dispatch will include "enhanced resolution and improved frame rates" on its release.</p>

<p>Many of us here at Eurogamer are big fans of Dispatch, and we are far from alone. Earlier this year, AdHoc announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">Dispatch had sold over 1m copies in just 10 days</a>. Thanks to this success, the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">now considering a second season</a> (perhaps one with more sex scenes, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">given the "ravenous" response to the first season</a>).</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently sat down with AdHoc studio co-founders Nick Herman and Pierre Shorette to discuss the team's episodic superhero comedy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">which includes the story of a cut Dispatch Kpop character</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/beloved-superhero-comedy-dispatch-is-seemingly-flying-onto-switch-2-next-year</link>
            <guid>1385890</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, here's a nice piece of news! Fresh off a couple of nominations at The Game Awards, it looks like AdHoc Studio's superhero workplace comedy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> will be flying onto Switch and Switch 2 early next year.</p>
<p>A surprise listing has popped up on the <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/AU/en/titles/70010000105332">Australian eShop</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dispatch-is-coming-to-switch-and-switch-2-early-2026/">Vooks</a> for the heads up), displaying the game and a free Switch 2 upgrade with a planned <strong>29th January</strong> release date.</p>
<p>And hey, this is good news! For those who missed out this year, Dispatch is a new comedy from the writers of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a>. It sees you step into the shoes of Robert Robertson (superhero alias, Mecha Man), who's forced to take a job in a superhero dispatch centre after his mech suit is destroyed in battle.</p>
<p>Strategically sending out supes is one thing, but a large part of the game is built around your decisions <em>outside</em> the action, with each choice having the potential to send the story in vastly different directions.</p>
<p>All of this is supported by a <em>stacked</em> voice cast, featuring the likes of <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>'s Aaron Paul, <strong>The Batman</strong>'s Jeffrey Wright, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s Alanah Pearce, <strong>Critical Role</strong>'s Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham and many, <em>many</em> more.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Shape the Story<br>
In Dispatch, every decision you make influences the unfolding narrative. From banter in the breakroom to life-or-death situations in the field, your choices affect your relationships with the heroes, their allegiances, and the path your own story takes.</p>
<p>&gt; Deploy Your Heroes<br>
Use the strategy map to review ongoing emergencies and deploy the right (or wrong) heroes to deal with them. Balance the risks and rewards as you make tactical decisions, knowing that each choice can have lasting consequences for your team and the city.</p>
<p>&gt; Manage Your Roster<br>
Managing heroes sometimes goes beyond their powers. Each hero comes with quirks, flaws, and baggage you’ll need to navigate to keep the team together. Upgrade their skills and unlock abilities to boost their effectiveness in the field.</p>
<p>Blending narrative, strategy, and humor, Dispatch explores what it means to be a hero, whether you're wearing a cape or behind a desk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Launching episodically earlier this year, Dispatch has gone on to rack up over 83,000 '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/#app_reviews_hash">Overwhelmingly Positive</a>' reviews on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Steam</a>. Our good friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/dispatch">Push Square</a> had this to say about the game's PS5 release: "While it's very light on meaningful gameplay, it tells a brilliantly paced, consistently entertaining superhero story that touches on some refreshingly adult themes".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creepy Jar has released a brand new trailer for its base building survival game StarRupture, giving a positive look at what is a not so great situation. The representative of Claywood Corporation gives a cheery view to the prisoners and exiles of Arcadia 7 on the luxuries they can expect, including accommodation, access to new technology, and nice views. The only disadvantage is the work and the hostile animal life that wants to feed on your base’s resources.</p>
<p><iframe title="StarRupture - &quot;Special Message&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0GBfgSq_5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In StarRupture, players take on the role of an exile from Earth who has been tasked with mining and expanding a base as part of their sentence. The game will be able feature co-op for up to four players, but if you want to explore this frontier alone you can. Weather cycles of the planet and regular attacks by Arcadia-7’s creatures will impede player progress, so learning the patterns and consequences of the dangers will be critical to making it through the days.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Creepy Jar released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/starrupture-gets-10-minutes-of-showcase-footage-showing-gameplay/">10 minutes of showcase footage showing gameplay for StarRupture</a>, which focused on the world of Arcadia 7 and its dangers. Creepy Jar previously released Green Hell, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/11/green-hell-review-spirits-of-amazonia/">in our review</a> Steve said,&nbsp;<em>“Green Hell is a fantastic survival experience with an exemplary sense of place and peril. Creepy Jar have really nailed the feeling of loneliness and despair that true isolation would lead to and married this to some well balanced challenges and a refreshingly user friendly approach. The range of ways to play are really welcome and should ensure that even those players who may be turned off by the rigours of hunger and thirst mechanics can enjoy the immersive jungle experience. This may not be a welcoming jungle, but there’s plenty of fun and games to be had.”</em></p>

<p>StarRupture will launch into Steam Early Access on January 6th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Visual Design]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/game-of-the-year-2025-best-visual-design/</link>
            <guid>1385884</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Welcome back to our Game of the Year picks for 2025 as we look to hand out our gong for Best Visual Design. Every year, this ends up being a heavily contested category, always swinging between games that impress in terms of sheer fidelity, pushing gaming hardware to the very limit, and titles with peerless art direction that seek to do more with less. More often than not, the winner strikes a deft balance between the two, as proved by this year’s winner…</p>

<p>We’ve always had somewhat of a soft spot for all things <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2012/03/01/review-journey-ps3/">Journey</a>. We’re also big fans of anything developer Giant Squid puts their name to, the studio’s previous games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/08/09/abzu-review/">Abzû</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/the-pathless-review-ps4-ps5-xbox-mobile/">The Pathless</a> – have a distinct Journey-like quality to them. So, naturally, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/12/sword-of-the-sea-review/">Sword of the Sea</a> almost feels tailor-made for us here at TSA, coming full circle with Journey’s art director, Matt Nava, joining forces with Giant Squid for a visually stunning jaunt through carefully crafted vistas.</p>


<p>These games shred dialogue and exposition, presenting their stories through striking set pieces and multi-layered worlds that flit between calmly isolating and full of life. As you play Sword of the Sea, you’ll venture through familiar deserts as well as ruins, and snowy mountains, the hero’s trusty blade capable of transforming these areas into thriving aquariums teeming with enchanting sea life. It’s yet another gorgeous game from Giant Squid and a worthy winner of this year’s award for Best Visual Design.</p>
<h3>Lumines Arise –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>When it comes to the rhythm action genre visuals can be just as important as audio, as proven by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines Arise</a>. It may not be quite as entrancing and new-feeling as developer Enhance’s previous game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/16/tetris-effect-connected-review-xbox-series-x/">Tetris Effect</a>, but it comes pretty close, pairing catchy tracks with immersive stage backgrounds and visual effects timed perfectly to match the player’s button presses. Together, these elements offer that near hypnotic sensory experience that elevates the Lumines formula and adds prestige to what started off as a gem for the PlayStation Portable.</p>

<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 –&nbsp;Runner Up</h3>
<p>Grabbing its second podium finish in this year’s Game of the Year awards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> really is the full package. Aside from its gripping, emotional narrative and smart evolution of the turn-based RPG formula, it also boasts some of this year’s most jaw-dropping visual set pieces.</p>
<p>Making smart use of ready-made assets for environments and scenery, to let the team put their efforts toward the more impactful “hero assets”, Sandfall conjured up a&nbsp;distinct dream-like surrealness that gives Expedition 33 its own identity, galvanised by Art Nouveau and Belle Époque influences. It breaks free of fantasy and steampunk tropes, imbuing every aspect – from character designs to battle menus – with a masterfully curated touch.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/ghost-of-yotei-review/">Ghost of Yotei</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/17/keeper-review/">Keeper</a></li>
<li>Once Upon A Katamari</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you come back tomorrow, for another aspect and accomplishment of game making to be featured.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Speedrunners creators are back with new game Sprint City]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/speedrunners-creators-are-back-with-new-game-sprint-city/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The original creators behind Speedrunners, Casper &amp; Gert-Jan, have announced Sprint City which is being developed by Second Stage Games. Sprint City looks very much like a successor to Speedrunners, though there is also a Speedrunners 2 in development by Fair Play Labs. It seems 2026 will be the year of sprinting for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sprint City | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2M4SkQLFRGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Co-Owner &amp; Game Designer at Second Stage Studio, Casper van Est, said <em>“With Sprint City, we wanted to focus on what we love most in games and what we’re best at, which is pure movement. It’s a shared world multiplayer experience built around how good it can feel just to move around, so we worked really hard on a satisfying game feel and a visual style that never gets in the way of that.”</em></p>
<p>In Sprint City, up to eight players can race against each other or free roam across different courses in the city, using wall runs and grapples to keep momentum going. Additionally, anyone who owns Sprint City will be able to invite friends in to play the game, even if they themselves do not own it. In multiplayer there will be leaderboards to climb as you aim to become the best sprinter in Sprint City.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Sprint City, but it is due to enter Steam Early Access in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonos Offloads Ace ANC Headphones With Spatial Audio, Apple and Bose Suddenly Look Overpriced]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-ace-anc-headphones-with-spatial-audio-apple-and-bose-suddenly-look-overpriced-2000654149</link>
            <guid>1385854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium noise-cancelling headphones flood the market with excellent options from Apple, Sony, Bose, and now Sonos, which means choosing between them often comes down to price rather than dramatic performance differences.</p>
<p>The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/">Amazon currently offers the Sonos Ace at a record low of $279, slashed from its typical $399 price tag</a> which makes this the most affordable these headphones have ever been since their launch. If you’re already invested in the Sonos ecosystem or simply appreciate the brand’s reputation for audio quality, this deal removes the premium pricing barrier that kept many potential buyers on the sidelines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic head tracking for spatial audio that really works</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos feature on the Sonos Ace gives you spatial audio that surrounds you</strong> with three-dimensional soundscapes instead of just sending stereo sound to your ears. Dynamic head tracking keeps track of how your head moves and changes the audio positioning so that sounds stay in their virtual places even when you turn or tilt your head: This technology changes how you listen to movies, immersive music mixes, and video game audio by giving you a sense of space and direction that regular stereo headphones can’t.</p>
<p>Bluetooth lossless audio streaming keeps the full quality of your music files without the artifacts that come with<strong> regular Bluetooth codecs and for truly lossless digital audio, you can also connect via USB-C</strong>. This is great for high-resolution music files or studio-quality recordings when you want the best sound quality possible. This dual connectivity method lets you choose between ease of use and the best sound quality, depending on where you’re listening and what you’re listening to.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation</strong> does a great job of blocking out outside sounds, even better than most of the products from Sony and Bose. The world-class ANC system easily blocks out noise from airplane cabins, coffee shops, streets, and offices, so you can fully focus on your audio content or just enjoy the quiet when you need a break from all the noise. When you need to hear announcements, have conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings for safety, transparency mode lets environmental sounds in which keeps you from feeling too isolated.</p>
<p>With Active Noise Cancellation turned on,<strong> the battery lasts for 30 hours</strong> which is enough for a whole week of commuting to work or weeks of casual listening between charges. The rapid charging feature lets you listen for three hours after just three minutes of being plugged in. This means that even a short charging session during a coffee break will give you enough power for the rest of the day.</p>



<p>You can easily switch between devices so you can go from watching a movie on your tablet to taking a call on your phone without having to go into Bluetooth settings and disconnect and reconnect. The headphones remember multiple paired devices and switch between them automatically based on which device needs sound at the time. When you use multiple devices throughout the day, this feature gets rid of the annoyance of having to pair them all the time, which is a problem with many wireless headphones.</p>
<p>At $279 instead of $399, you’re saving $120 on headphones that compete with flagship models from established audio brands that often cost even more at full retail price. The Sonos Ace delivers premium features like lossless audio, Dolby Atmos with head tracking, world-class ANC, and 30-hour battery life at a price that now undercuts many competitors that offer similar or inferior specifications.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="638">While many gamers have long wished for an official handheld Xbox console, it seems unlikely that Microsoft will make that dream a reality anytime soon. However, Asus is offering something very close with the release of the updated ROG Ally, now sporting official Xbox branding.

                <p>It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn't sold as well as 2024's Black Ops 6</a>, and now Circana has released more sales data that speaks to the performance of the military shooter.</p><p>Black Ops 7 was the No. 1 best-selling game in North America for November, but the Call of Duty franchise experienced a double-digit percent decrease for full-game dollar sales compared to November 2024. Last year's game, Black Ops 6, was released in October. Despite the sales downturn, this marks the 18th straight year that a new Call of Duty game has ranked No. 1 for its launch month. For anyone keeping score, that streak began with 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is now the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 so far, with EA's Battlefield 6 continuing to rank No. 1 for the year. For November, Black Ops 7 was No. 1, followed by Battlefield 6, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and EA Sports FC 26 rounding out the top five for the month.</p><p>The Circana report doesn't tell the whole story of Black Ops 7's sales performance, as the company only tracks sales in North America. Additionally, Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, which eats into full-game sales. For 2024's Black Ops 6, a report estimated that Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">lost out on $300 million in revenue due to Game Pass.</a></p><p>Microsoft no doubt also saw upside, too, though, with new sign-ups for Game Pass and engagement. To that end, Call of Duty--as a collective franchise spanning multiple titles--will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">finish 2025 as the No. 1 franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a></p><p>It is rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-modern-warfare-4-rumors-cod-dev-says-not-to-believe-everything-on-the-internet/1100-6537000/" data-ref-id="1100-6537000">2026's new Call of Duty game is Modern Warfare 4 from developer Infinity Ward</a>, though this is not confirmed.</p>

                <p>Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025.</p><p>November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units).</p><p>While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>For November 2025, Sony's PS5 ranked No. 1 for both unit sales and dollar sales--it's the first time the PS5 is back on top since the Switch 2 came out in June. The Switch 2, meanwhile, landed at No. 2 for unit and dollar sales in November 2025, with the Nex Playground coming in third for hardware units sold. Xbox Series X|S ranked No. 3 for dollar sales in November 2025.</p><p>In terms of software sales for November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/" data-ref-id="1100-6537040">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 ranked No. 1 for the month</a>, extending Call of Duty's streak to 18 years in a row where the franchise has debuted in the top spot for its release month. However, Call of Duty franchise sales experienced double-digit declines.</p><p>For 2025 so far, EA's Battlefield 6 is still the year's best-selling game in North America.</p>

That's why this update brings a number of new building parts, including the ability to change the color of building pieces and the "much-requested triangular pieces." The building menu UI has also been redesigned and reformatted into a list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not all. Melee combat has been improved to make it "more viable and fun," and now, when summoning a raid boss at the Summoning Altar, players can choose to either fight at their base as before, or take on the raid boss in a special Raid Area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Raid Areas allow you to fight with all your might, without risking any damage to your base," the team explained. "You can build temporary structures and take items into these special Raid Areas." Which is just as well, as a new raid boss will also pop up after the update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"2025 has been an incredible year for Palworld, and we’re excited to end the year with v0.7, Home Sweet Home!" Pocketpair exclaimed. "The purpose of this update is to begin improving existing features, and while this update may not be as content-rich as previous ones, we hope players understand that it’s necessary for us to begin laying the groundwork now as we work on the development of Palworld 1.0."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but definitely not least, PvP! Though the studio admits PvP has been a topic of discussion in the Palworld community for a "long time," and it’s "hard to fully integrate PvP into the game," it is trying to make the dream a reality, albeit with some careful parameters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are releasing all the necessary tools for players to set up their own PvP rules on their own terms," Pocketpair said. "Show off your skills and compete with other Pal Tamers! Please note that PvP is experimental, and as such, there may be some balancing issues."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld v0.7 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">ULTRAKILL Collab!</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added V1 and V2 armor sets!

            <guid>1385788</guid>

<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161167/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>My pigs are starving and I do not know how to feed them.</p>
<p>The pig feed is ready to pick up at the shop, but I don’t know where the shop is. Once I find the correct establishment, I need to figure out how to pick up the pallets of food and take them back to my emaciated swine.</p>
<p>Later, after I purchased a front loader and the appropriate bucket attachment, I take the feed back to my farm. Then comes another problem. How do I actually deposit it in the trough?</p>
<p>As a casual guest in the world of simulators, having only played <strong>Train</strong> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/euro_truck_simulator_2">Euro Truck Simulator</a> for short spells, I must admit I was a bit overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/farming-simulator-signature-edition">Farming Simulator: Signature Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> will recognise the setup straight away. Your grandfather is getting a bit long in the tooth and wants to leave you in charge of his agricultural empire. It is up to you to tend the land, reap, sow, and explore the surrounding community.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161166/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Stardew, this is not a cutesy, cosy life sim. Instead, it is a meticulously designed and realistic depiction of farming life. There is more painstaking attention to detail in a single combine harvester here than there is in most racing games.</p>
<p>After your grandfather takes you through a brief tutorial tour, you are free to tackle your life as a farmer in any way you desire. My immediate compulsion was towards animal husbandry, which, as mentioned, was far more complex than I imagined.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the best things about these games is that there is no one way to play. The map, of which there are several to choose from, is a surprisingly biodiverse collection of land plots and population centres.</p>
<p>You are free to begin your career from scratch or as a mature farmer. Either way, the core loop of the game is in engaging with its many systems of commerce to earn a profit. Seasonal variation, layout, and topography vary between the maps, but everything else remains the same. You trade with the same collection of NPCs and the overwhelming contents of the in-game stores are the same regardless of career choice.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161165/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a newcomer, I chose to start a farm from scratch. There is a guided tutorial of sorts, but it only scratches the surface of the myriad systems at play. From there, I had to look up almost every aspect of farm life. While series veterans may not find the early hours as obtuse as I did, these kinds of games would still benefit from putting information more front and centre.</p>
<p>That said, there is a wealth of accessibility and quality-of-life options available throughout your farming adventures. Almost every task can be completed by an AI farmhand, who will cultivate fields, deliver yields, and handle all the repeatable work that you are too rich to bother with after reaching a certain level of maturity.</p>
<p>These simulators can be as simple or as complex as you make them, but there are still lots of plates to spin. On any given day cycle, you'll be keeping an eye on the calendar to grow crops at the optimal time, managing your animal produce, and steadily growing your empire to make grandfather proud. Then there is the farm equipment itself, each machine having a different purpose and slight variation on how to drive and control them. Every single task in Farming Simulator requires a specific tool to undertake. The late game almost becomes a collectathon as you populate your farm with a fleet of shiny tractors and attachments.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161173/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This kind of time sink is tailor-made for Switch. The just-one-more-hour compulsion and cyclical routine feel perfect for long trips in handheld mode, or for docked couch sessions. It is exactly the sort of game that fits the platform’s strengths.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that the optimisation of this Switch 2 port is sorely lacking in places. General image fidelity is solid between modes, but performance is wildly unpredictable. The game struggles to hold a steady 30fps in both docked and undocked modes.</p>
<p>Some areas, particularly your hub farm, tank the frame rate considerably. Elsewhere, there are frequent graphical glitches and bugs. For me, this involved excessive clipping into terrain and loss of vehicle control. There aren't even any Switch 2 native additions to the experience, with mouse controls sadly missing. Touchscreen is present across all functionality, which, for a game where you spend most of your time in menus, is a mercy.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161176/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Audio is sharp, particularly in the sounds of the machinery, which are as distinct as their visual rendering. If you don't want to hear the endless chug of a tractor engine, there's a selection of original music on the in-game radio. Why not listen to chip tune anthems while cutting down deadwood?</p>
<p>The appeal of Farming Simulator is obvious, even from the perspective of a fledgling land tiller like myself. However, the uneven technical presentation will ultimately compromise anyone willing to sink a few hundred hours into the experience, especially if Giants Software does not find a way to patch in some much-needed stability.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Farming Simulator arrives on Switch 2 in a familiar state for returning fans. While newcomers will face an early spike of confusion before eventually settling into the addictive routine of virtual agriculture, veterans will immediately feel at home. Unfortunately, technical issues with the port will blight the careers of both camps.</p></section>
