            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-touryst-deluxe-switch-2-an-upgrade-to-first-class-for-the-return-trip.1318405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It feels like absolutely ages ago that I first reviewed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/touryst">The Touryst</a> on Switch, and returning to it so far down the line, and on the Switch 2 no less, I've been excited to see just how it's held up in the six years since I last took a vacation. Seriously, though.</p>
<p>I was bowled over back in the day, giving Shin'en's adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/touryst">a whopping great 9/10</a>. I loved its voxel graphics and oh-so-lovely controls, its clever puzzles and breezy, beautiful vibes. It's all about the tiny details in this one and, in much the same way as the remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a> — also 2019 — the devs (as usual with Shin'en) have got another real looker out of Nintendo's console, with each of the islands you visit presented as gorgeous bespoke miniatures of the likes of Ibiza, with its beach parties, or an idyllic Greek island replete with rooftops to clamber across. Half the fun here really is in just gawping at everything.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:94016 @ 1759838939 -->
<p>There's barely any story to speak of, which perhaps is the game's one drawback (although I'm all for the "let's get down to business" approach sometimes). Each island contains a secret TOWA tower you'll need to uncover and unlock, before heading inside to complete a conundrum or two and obtain a magic core. Collect all cores and deliver them to win the day. As you go, you're entertained by minigames and silly side missions. The Touryst delivers all the good things, without laborious cutscenes or unnecessary drama.</p>
<p>All of this is presented not just in a wonderfully stylish way but in an eminently playable one, too. Your tourist avatar is a capable fellow, despite appearances, with a steady stream of new moves to unlock from the hub island's surf shop. He feels perfect to control as he wobbles carefully and/or speed boosts around locations, and each of the dinky dungeons is so painstakingly crafted that you can't help but be drawn in. Yes, I'm enjoying it all over again.</p>
<p>For this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/touryst-deluxe">Deluxe</a> Switch 2 update, you get an excellent new island to mess on (no spoilers from moi), so more side missions and a whole new tower to explore. It also can't be underestimated how much nicer it looks and plays. No jaggy edges, pristine performance and resolution, and they've added ambient occlusion, improved rain effects, global illumination, and all that fancy stuff. More exciting, though, is the new Fast Zero arcade machine in the game's arcade (a little tribute to Shin'en's excellent anti-grav racers), which you're gonna love.</p>
<p>So, The Touryst: Deluxe gives us Shin'en's excellent 2019 adventure, plus a new island, fun new minigames and missions, and a new arcade game that may well be worth the price of entry alone. With snazzy Switch 2 graphical effects and super smooth performance, it's perfect if you've yet to play it. And with a reduced price point for seasoned travellers — returning players are presented with a 75% discount on the eShop — this is a return trip that's very hard to knock.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-touryst-deluxe]]></content:encoded>

            <p>****, we didn't mean for that to happen. This has been the response from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> developers Activision to folks spotting that you couldn't type the name of fellow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> into the chat of the game's beta without it being censored. Yep, you could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-censor-arc-raiders">reportedly</a> get away with Arc or Raiders, but stick the two together, and it was off to the starred-out naughty corner.</p>
<p>Naturally, folks wondered why this was a thing, especially since you could chat about more obvious Black Ops 7 competitor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> to your heart's content without facing any star-based repercussions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/activision-angles-for-the-most-petty-corporation-prize-by-censoring-the-name-arc-raiders-in-black-ops-7s-lobbies/">Penguin Choir Gamer</a>, a text filter error was to blame according to Activision. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/activision-ban-arc-raiders-black-ops-7-explained/">Insider Gaming</a> report having been offered more specifics regarding the nature of the error, with Activision saying it was down the word 'Arc' being listed as an alternative for a naughty word, and pairing it with 'Raiders' caused the moderation system to flag up an inappropriate phrase.</p>
<p>It seems strange that if 'Arc' was the root of the issue, you'd only be pinged upon adding the seemingly innocuous 'Raiders', but hey, text filters can be weird sometimes. A quick stealth patch has since been issued and it's now possible to type out Arc Raiders' name. It's also worth noting that the EA had to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1mhrrhd/ea_is_censoring_arc_raiders_in_their_chats/">resolve a similar Arc Raiders name censorship issue with their app earlier this year</a>, so it very much looks like this is just a standard text moderation quirk.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>At least Arc Raiders devs Embark Studios have been able to have a bit of fun with the free publicity they've gotten out of the misbehaving filters.</p>
<p>Even if this had been down to shooter publishers cheekily blocking out competitors' names from their games' chats, that'd probably rank relatively low on the outrage scale for me. An inconvenience perhaps if you're talking to mates and comparing two shooters while playing, but there's plenty of third-party chatting software that'd seem a more practical forum for such discussions anyway. Or maybe I just need to get better so I can comfortably type out 'I see your point esteemed colleague, but I feel the recoil of [insert game]'s guns is exactly three per cent more satisfying' in between headshots.</p><p>You could also discuss the ups and downs of ***** *** *, *********** *, and *** ******* in the RPS comments section instead. The former's beta has just been extended to run until October 9th, if you weren't already aware.</p>

This has made Haunted Chocolatier highly anticipated, although little information about the game has been shared, beyond making it clear that it's a game where you move to a new town and take over a chocolate shop.

featuring music from the game, but no additional gameplay. The trailer briefly shows a snowy mountain, with a bakery and other buildings, including your chocolate shop. From the chocolate shop, the player jumps into a portal, which takes them to a combat dungeon, which shows more in-depth combat mechanics. That portal is also where you gather chocolate ingredients, which can be used back at the chocolate shop to make products to sell in the store.</p><p dir="ltr">Shop customization is shown after that, with shelves for products and decorations. This is also where the Haunted part of the name comes in, with a bunch of ghosts running the chocolate store for you. The final section of the trailer shows a quick handful of interactions with different NPCs living in the town, with gift giving as well, likely containing a relationship system similar to Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_platforms">Haunted Chocolatier platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, Haunted Chocolatier has only been announced for PC, but ConcernedApe mentioned in the game's <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/" rel="nofollow ">FAQ </a>that he intends to bring it to other major platforms. Stardew Valley was initially only available on PC, but was later ported to nearly every modern platform, including all consoles and mobile.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Story__Setting__and_Characters">Haunted Chocolatier Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580854"></a><figcaption>In Haunted Chocolatier has you leave the big city to run a chocolate shop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580854-choco1.jpg"></figure><p>As part of ConcernedApe wanting to take his time making Haunted Chocolatier, he has kept many of the details about what exactly Haunted Chocolatier is close to his chest. That said, the basic premise has been revealed--you'll take on the role of running a chocolate shop with some spooky help.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few named characters shown in the announcement trailer, like Burk the blacksmith and a woman named Maddie. The name of the town hasn't been revealed, nor has the reason for your character taking over the chocolate factory, but a brief conversation about the big city in the trailer suggests at least a similar character background to the farmer in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Gameplay">Haunted Chocolatier Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4580856"></a><figcaption>Making chocolate will be one of the primary focuses of Haunted Chocolatier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4580856-choco4.jpg"></figure><p>As the name suggests, the main gameplay loop will revolve around gathering ingredients, making chocolate, and selling chocolate. In the <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/08/hello-world/" rel="nofollow ">announcement blog</a>, this was the only gameplay mechanic highlighted, although it was implied to share gameplay elements with Stardew Valley, like having a cast of NPCs to befriend and possibly romance. While details are still fairly light, ConcernedApe has provided some details regarding combat and chocolate making.</p><p dir="ltr">Two additional blog posts provide more details on the gameplay. First is a <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/05/10/intuitive-chocolate-making/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> about "Intuitive" chocolate making, where ConcernedApe vaguely describes that the chocolate making gameplay loop will have multiple ways to progress and make chocolate, some more systems based and others based on "intuitive" chocolate making. The second <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2021/10/30/combat-shields-stuns-my-approach/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> is focused on combat, specifically highlighting a shield system that allows you to stun enemies, rewarding a defensive play-style and showing that the Haunted Chocolatier combat system will have more depth than Stardew Valley's.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Haunted_Chocolatier_Development_News">Haunted Chocolatier Development News</h2><p dir="ltr">It has been about four years since the original announcement of Haunted Chocolatier, and aside from a couple of blog posts talking about specific aspects of the game, ConcernedApe has not commented on how the game is progressing in specific detail. The most recent <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> on the Haunted Chocolatier website from September 2, 2025, mentions that while a Stardew Valley 1.7 update is in the works, ConcernedApe himself is focused on Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog states that Haunted Chocolatier will release eventually, and that it could even release before Stardew Valley 1.7, but that nothing is set in stone. ConcernedApe did reiterate multiple times that he is working on Haunted Chocolatier entirely solo, and that there is no release window being targeted just yet.</p>

                <p>Battlefield veteran David Goldfarb's studio, The Outsiders, is closing down, but Goldfarb and the team are "not giving up."</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1975200395128610955" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Goldfarb said The Outsider is shutting up shop as part of wider cuts at studio owner Funcom. The Outsiders, which was founded in 2015, had a close call at closing up shop when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darkborn-the-monster-game-from-battlefield-and-pay/1100-6476722/" data-ref-id="1100-6476722">the studio's other game, Darkborn, was canceled in 2020</a>, Goldfarb said. After that game didn't make it, Funcom took a majority ownership of The Outsiders. The studio then released the rhythm-action game Metal: Hellsinger in 2022.</p><p>"It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen," Goldfarb said.</p><p>Goldfarb said The Outsiders had plans to make something "even better" in the future, but "things don't always go the way you hope."</p><p>That being said, Goldfarb said, "We are not giving up, and we are going to try to continue on in some new form. Change is always tough and right now we are all hurting."</p><p>The Outsiders had around 60 employees at the Stockholm office, <a href="https://www.funcom.com/funcom-stockholm/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Funcom.</a> The company recently announced that this year's Dune: Awakening was its biggest release in the company's 32-year history, but despite that, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the publisher slashed a number of jobs.</a></p><p>Goldfarb is known for his work on the Battlefield franchise from when he worked at DICE. He left in 2012 to join Overkill Software as the game director for the beloved Payday 2 before leaving to establish The Outsiders in 2015.</p>

			<p>In addition to the 23 versatile Jobs available for every unit, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 12 unique characters, each with a powerful, exclusive Job Command. Here is our tier list for these special units, highlighting which characters are essential to create a party that can deal with all sorts of enemies.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, with rankings determined by each unit’s utility at the time of joining and in the endgame, growth potential, and skill set synergy with Jobs other than their unique main Job. The ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings and Classic Mode. Screenshots were captured from the 1.0 Steam release.</strong></em></p>

<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cidolfus Orlandeau is the best character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cidolfus Orlandeau</strong> - The Sword Saint has always been considered as the best character in the game since the original, and this holds in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles as well, despite some damage nerfs. His starting weapon, the Knight Sword Excalibur, and his Swordplay Job giving him access to Physical Attack-based ranged AOE, ranged equipment breaking, and self-healing, make him an absolute powerhouse that lets him solo entire maps and break the game's difficulty <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Ramza Beoulve</strong> - The main protagonist of Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not as broken as Orlandeau, but is still an extremely capable character thanks to the his unique Mettle command that gives him access to some powerful support abilities like Tailwind, Steel, and Shout, which increases his Bravery, Physical Attack, Magic Attack, and Speed. His Squire Job, which becomes Gallant Knight in Chapter 4, also provides him with some great equipment options, and the great PA and MA growth make him a highly versatile, customizable character who can deal with any foe in the game. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 1)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Agrias Oaks joins early in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, and remains a great character until the end of the game</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Agrias Oaks</strong> - The Holy Knight protector of Princess Ovelia is the first powerhouse to join Ramza in his quest, and she stays very useful until the end of the game thanks to her versatility. Her Holy Sword Job Command gives her access to useful Physical Attack-based AOE attacks that can also cause status ailments, while her relatively high Magical Attack can be taken advantage of to give her better support capabilities with the White Magic Job Command. Her lower Physical Attack, however, requires some investment to bring it closer to Orlandeau's or Ramza's. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Beowulf Cadmus </strong>- The Templar is among the most divisive special characters in the game, but his utility far outweighs his shortcomings. Although his starting Bravery is low and his Physical Attack is not great, the Spellblade Job Command gives him access to status ailment-inducing skills that require no charge time, outclassing the Mystic Job significantly and giving him the potential to take down enemies with a single hit via the Break skill. By increasing his Magic Attack, the Spellblade abilities also gain increased hit chance, making Beowulf even more useful in a variety of situations.   <em>(</em><em>Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Reis Dular </strong>- While her special Job, Dragonkin, provides situational yet solid utility with ranged attack and support most of the time, her HP, Physical Attack, and Magic Attack growth, and her high starting Bravery and Faith stats make for a versatile character that can make every generic Job shine, regardless of whether PA or MA oriented.                                                                                                                                                       <em></em><em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>. Her human form is unlocked after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia)</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Meliadoul Tingel</strong> - The Divine Knight is a solid Physical Attack-oriented character who can break enemy equipment from range with her Unyielding Blade abilities. Although her usability has been improved in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles over the original by making these abilities deal damage against monsters, Meliadoul is the last special character to join Ramza, and with her limited versatility, she requires more investment than the best characters in the game to shine. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though his damage output falls off in the late game, Mustadio Bunanza remains a great utility character throughout Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rapha Galthena</strong> - The Skyseer comes with one of the most unique Job Commands in the game, Sky Mantra, which gives her access to powerful elemental spells that do not require MP, scale with Magic Attack, and ignore her Faith, which can deal very high damage multiple times. Unfortunately, these spells randomly hit their AOE, making them unreliable, even with the increased hit chance at the center tile of the AOE improvement. Still, her high Magic Attack growth and her high starting Faith make her an excellent mage with some time investment. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mustadio Bunanza</strong> - The Machinist is the first special character to join Ramza, and his utility stays high for the entirety of the game, thanks to his weapon of choice, Guns, and the Aimed Shot Job Command that can Disable and Immobilize enemies, and turn undead to stone. While his damage heavily falls off later on, requiring the rare elemental guns to keep up with the output of other characters, his utility does not, making him a solid choice for some battles where preventing enemies from acting is more important than dealing damage. <em>(Recruited in Chapter 2)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><span><strong>Byblos</strong>&nbsp;- The unique demon character who joins Ramza out of nowhere after clearing the game's optional endgame dungeon, Midlight's Deep, is a strong monster character with excellent</span> stats and versatile skills that make it useful in various<span> situations.</span> However, being unable to change its equipment and its Job, and its late joining when the game is essentially over impacts its utility considerably, as its only real use is in random battles and the game's final gauntlet of battles. <em>(Recruited after completing Midlight's Deep in Chapter 4)</em></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Cloud Strife requires a lot of investment to be a good character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloud Strife </strong>- The stranded Final Fantasy VII protagonist has his Limit Break attacks as his Soldier Job Command, but even starting with the Materia Blade required to use them, the enhanced Materia Blade+ obtainable with the Treasure Hunter ability at the highest point of the Mount Bervenia map, and the reduced charge time are not enough to make him as strong as other special characters in the game. Still, he can hold his own with some skills, like the Time Mage's Swiftness to speed up his abilities' charge time, but as he joins quite late, the time investment will not be worth it for most players. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available after winning the battle in Zeltennia in Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party)</em></li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Construct 8</strong> - The Steel Giant is a real powerhouse under the right conditions. Its high Physical Attack makes its skillset extremely powerful, and its immunity to status ailments is a welcome bonus. However, his inability to enter water severely limits his mobility on most maps, and being unable to change gear or Job severely hinders its versatility, making it an extremely situational character. <em>(Recruited after completing a sidequest available from the beginning of Chapter 4 - Requires Mustadio to be in the party</em>)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Encumbered by how the mechanics powering his Nether Mantra skills, Marach Galthena is the worst special character in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marach Galthena</strong> - On paper, the Netherseer has the potential of being as powerful as his sister Rapha, but in reality, he leaves a lot to be desired. His Nether Mantra skills, which work like Rapha's Sky Mantra, are more effective the lower his Faith his, but this makes it impossible to build him as an effective mage. Marach's base Job does not have great HP and Physical Attack,  so he needs a complete Job change into a Physical Attack-based class to be somewhat useful and take limited advantage of his Nether Mantra unique Job Command. This time investment for a character that essentially ends up being little more than a generic unit makes Marach the worst special character in the game. (<em>Recruited in Chapter 4</em>)</li>

            <p>
The factional asymmetry of Mars Tactics ain’t about Fish Himbos vs The Telepathic Hairdryer Folk of the Highlands. It gives you the bracingly topical choice of suits vs revolutionaries. In the blue corner, you’ve got the iron fist of Capital, who begin each campaign in a position of supremacy, but are beholden to the fatter cats on Earth for supplies. And in the red corner, you’ve got Labo(u)r, who kick off with little more than their chains, but are able to manufacture their own gear due to being honest working folk, and have higher morale due to being a bunch of zealous bolshies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can tailor their differences further by means of governmental policies. Introducing Universal Basic Income, for instance, means you can deploy robot workers without riling up your fleshy dogsbodies quite as much. Fully automated luxury communism for all! Except you, Kevin - I'm sending you off on a doomed mission to reclaim that rocketpad from the fuzz. You can also found a police state, set up labour camps, and embrace neoliberalism, if you're feeling especially dystopic. More pragmatic research projects include fermentation: if ideology alone won’t carry the day, perhaps some liquid courage will do the job.

Between Capital and Labor sprawl the deserts of Mars: curiously cuboid, usefully deformable, and rich in building components. To claim the wargod’s favourite planet, you’ll need both a shrewd understanding of cover and a head for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. You need to capture and defend resource hubs, build railways, and get hold of some jets for troop movement and airstrikes. You need sturdy offworld trade connections. You might want to hire a few mercenaries.
</p><p>
The battles are turn-based, and waged by squads of upgradeable, customisable troopers. They look a lot like XCOM, perhaps with a splash of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a>. You can suppress foes both to sabotage their aim and steal initiative from them. You can also gouge out trenches with explosives, call in artillery strikes from neighbouring regions, and toss unprimed grenades or spare magazines of ammo between friendlies. Foes can be captured, then interrogated for intel, then held for ransom. As for the guns, there’s a phat grid editor that includes a choice of scopes, stocks, calibers, and receivers.
</p>
<p>
It all seems very appealing, though I’m basing that assessment on trailers and snatches of press release – please qualify my enthusiasm appropriately. I am crossing my fingers for 1) a demo, and 2) a Total Recall-inspired endgame involving underground terraformers. Please, though, no boggle-eyed Arnie death scenes. The developers are Takibi Games, and the publishers are Hooded Horse, who have a good nose for this kind of thing. It’s out in early access in May 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">Elevate your game and save yourself a solid $100 during Amazon’s Prim Big Deals Day with this Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor,</a> currently going for an even $100 off during the sales event.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger already has plenty of content to sink your teeth into, but Bandai Namco isn’t holding back, and plenty more is on the cards to be added in upcoming DLC.</p>



<p>While it will take a while to gather all the Digimon in the game, particularly given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digi-Eggs are required for some</a>, the list of Digimon will get even longer with upcoming content drops, which will also extend the main story of the game with new episodes.</p>



<p>If you’re mulling over which DLC to purchase, or want to know what’s included in the Season Pass, we’ve got all the important details.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-upcoming-digimon-story-time-stranger-dlc-amp-release-windows">All Upcoming Digimon Story: Time Stranger DLC &amp; Release Windows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>DLC goodies. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Three Episode Packs are confirmed to be coming to Digimon Story: Time Stranger as DLC and in the season pass, though an exact release date has not been set.</strong></p>



<p>Available in the Season Pass, Episode Packs 1-3 will all be released in the next calendar year, with Bandai Namco confirming the content will drop before September 30, 2026.</p>



<p>At this stage, though, it’s unclear when exactly each Episode Pack will drop, and whether the DLC cycle will be extended beyond an additional year. </p>



<p>The table below lists all upcoming DLC, which we’ll update to include release dates as they are confirmed.</p>

<p><strong>Several pieces of DLC are already available for Digimon Story: Time Stranger, many of which are included in the Ultimate Edition and Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>While the Episode Packs bring additional Digimon and new content, the other DLC currently available in the game are mostly just cosmetic options. However, there are some that provide in-game boosts with additional items and currency, acting as a head-start pack.</p>



<p>The table below shows all currently available DLC, the edition of the game it’s included in, and whether it’s available to purchase separately.</p>

            <p>The remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> is reportedly heading to the PS Plus catalogue later this month, available for Extra and Premium subscribers.</p>
<p>That's according to reliable insider billbil_kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">Dealabs</a>, who reported Konami and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake will be added on 21st October.</p>

<p>As such, the game's reported inclusion on PS Plus would give PlayStation a boost should those other formats be announced imminently.</p>
<p>It also continues momentum for the series, following the release last month of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> developed by NeoBards Entertainment and published by Konami.</p>
<p>"Silent Hill f's frustrating first-half is outweighed by a brilliant, delirious second that's well worth the initial slog," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">Silent Hill f review</a>.</p>
<p>Bloober, meanwhile, released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> last month, its original sci-fi survival horror set in 1980's Poland that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">also been well-received</a>.</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is coming soon to PlayStation Plus Extra, according to renowned leaker billbil-kun. In a post <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">published on Dealabs.com</a>, the leaker said the game should join Sony's middle PS Plus tier on October 21.  Billbil-kun is well-informed on these announcements. Just recently, the leaker had revealed in advance that Remedy's Alan Wake 2 would be added to the PlayStation Plus Essential lineup, which Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-ps-plus-essential-october-the-last-of-us-part-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed during the latest State of Play presentation</a>.</p>



<p>Bloober Team and KONAMI launched the Silent Hill 2 remake a year ago, receiving widespread critical and fan acclaim after pre-release skepticism. On Wccftech, Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 9 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>



<p>To date, the game has sold more than two million units, persuading KONAMI to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partner once again with Bloober Team to remake the first installment in the revered horror franchise</a>, too. Meanwhile, the incredibly prolific Polish studio has already launched another sci-fi horror game based on its own brand-new franchise, Cronos: New Dawn. This game also received a solid score (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8/10</a>) on Wccftech from reviewer Francesco De Meo: </p>



<p><em>Although its first hours do a frankly bad job of getting players involved from a gameplay perspective, Cronos: The New Dawn is ultimately a very engaging game, and one of Bloober Team's best games alongside the Silent Hill 2 remake. While its flaws remain evident throughout the adventure, the game's unique setting, engaging mystery-filled story, and gameplay, which starts coming together after the very first boss battle a few hours in, make The Traveler's mission one worthy of embarking on for all survival horror fans, especially those who love the Dead Space series.</em></p>

              <p>It feels like&nbsp;<em>forever</em> since we had a big gaming rivalry. Since the dawn of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> it has gone through patches of directly competing with other big-name shooter franchises, whether they were <em>Medal of Honor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, with everyone obliged to take a side. It’s kind of nostalgic to see it happening again, with the announcement that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s current beta is being extended by an extra 24 hours, to bring it close enough to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s release to creepily whisper in its ear.</p> <p>The current <em>CoDBlops 7&nbsp;</em>beta was due to come to an end at 12 p.m. EDT on Wednesday 8 October, but has now been given a 24 hour extension, along with a brand new map to play on and double XP rewarded until the new deadline of Thursday 9th. And you know this was planned from the start, designed to tread on <em>BF6</em>‘s heels as much as possible.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632462">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>The sixth and final map is Toshin, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-ninja-gaiden-forza-2000628659">much vaunted Japanese setting</a> complete with cherry blossoms, a downtown shopping district, and a rather unfortunate central monorail crash. The update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes"><em>Call of Duty</em> patchnotes blog</a> also mentions that double XP&nbsp;<em>and</em> double weapon XP will be running through the end of the beta on Thursday, trying to keep as many eyes looking toward this franchise and not glancing away at EA’s rival.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082">Reports from the beta so far</a> have suggested issues with mulitplayer matchmaking (which of course is one of the reasons these betas are run in the first place—to try to get on top of problems like this before the release), as well as grumbles about TTK and oddly enough, the game’s closing doors.</p>

 <p>Come the end of the beta, attention returns to&nbsp;<em>Blops 6</em> and season 6’s The Haunting event for Halloween from October 9, which also happens to be the day&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> comes out. At that point, FPS fans’ attentions will be torn, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">but many will be tempted by the shiny new object</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> then has more than a month to itself, with <em>Black Ops 7 </em>not out until November 14 and not planning any more betas before then. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s long enough for <em>BF6</em> players to have had their fill and be willing to move across, or if both games can maintain their own audiences in the holiday season. Certainly Activision and EA are <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">both planning</a> an awful lot of post-game content to try to keep everyone’s attention, and I’m looking forward to sitting back with popcorn to watch it all play out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-65w-3-port-charger-is-down-to-pennies-amazon%E2%80%99s-nearly-giving-away-the-last-units.1318345/</guid>

              <p>Multi-device charging becomes a daily headache when you’re constantly swapping cables and hunting for available outlets. You need one charger that can handle your laptop, phone and tablet without compromising speed or taking up half your desk. <strong>Anker’s 65W Charger solves this with three ports (USB-C and USB-A)</strong> in a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case. These chargers haven’t seen meaningful discounts in months with the last comparable pricing showing up during July’s… Prime Day. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">bringing that record low price back for Prime members right now, dropping it from $39 to $25</a> for this Prime Big Deal Day event.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GaN II Technology Redefines the Charging Game</h2>
<p>The Nano II Anker charger employs GaN II technology and it is <strong>running twice as fast as a typical silicon-based charger</strong>. That elevated speed creates smaller internal component sizes for the same output, hence how Anker managed to pack a whopping 65W into a tiny form factor.</p>
<p>With three devices plugged in simultaneously, the <strong>charger dynamically divides power across ports based on what’s plugged in</strong>. The dividing of power is by way of PPS protocols which speak to your devices to deliver only the wattage each is capable of receiving. If we say a MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an iPad are plugged in simultaneously, for example, the charger might deliver 45 watts to the laptop, 15 watts to the iPad, and 5 watts to the phone.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration includes <strong>a pair of USB-C ports and a USB-A port</strong>. The USB-C configuration for two ports is good for newer phones, tablets, and laptops, which have embraced USB-C but older devices like wireless headphones, fitness monitors, or Kindle readers, which are yet to conform, are dealt with by the USB-A port.</p>
<p>Also, GaN II technology <strong>enhances heat management</strong> better than traditional charger designs. The new circuit board architecture and stacked component arrangement allow for better heat dissipation, enabling the charger to remain cooler even for longer periods of use. It will warm up during high-charge sessions which is typical but it should not become unbearably hot, causing concern about leaving it on a charger for an entire night.</p>
<p>At $25, it’s costing about $8.33 per port for a charger that will do everything from our phones to our laptops. If we contrast it to getting individual chargers for each piece of equipment, we see how valuable it is. That it’s available at a price equal to July’s Prime Day’s cheapest, despite its absence of discounts for several months, makes it a good buy now.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-is-upset-amazon-has-dropped-the-meta%E2%80%AFquest%E2%80%AF3s%E2%80%AF128%E2%80%AFgb-price-for-the-third-time.1318339/</guid>

              <p>Getting into virtual reality has always meant making a tough choice: <strong>spend big on premium hardware or skip it entirely</strong>. Meta designed the Quest 3S to fix that problem, creating an entry point into mixed reality that doesn’t require a second mortgage. The catch? Meta rarely discounts their hardware. Instead of price cuts, they’ve traditionally thrown in free games or extended their Meta Horizon+ subscription for a few months. Actual savings on the headset itself simply didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day is changing that pattern for the first time ever,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/"> dropping the 128GB Quest 3S with the Gorilla Tag Cardboard Hero Bundle from $299 to $249</a>. If you’ve been thinking about early holiday shopping or surprising someone with their first VR experience, this timing couldn’t be better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Price Matters for Newcomers to Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S is <strong>Meta’s most accessible path into current-generation mixed reality technology</strong>. At $249, you’re getting hardware that shares the same core processor as the more expensive Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This processor handles the demanding computational work of tracking your environment, rendering games at smooth frame rates, and blending virtual objects into your real-world surroundings.</p>
<p>Mixed reality overlays virtual information onto your own reality by way of passthrough cameras: You may play games where virtual entities speak to your furniture, construct virtual desks with multiple floating monitors all around your own workspace or work out and yet see your living room. This integration of worlds holds you <strong>anchored to your own space rather than isolating you from reality</strong>.</p>

<p>The headset runs at a whopping 1<strong>832 x 1920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate</strong>. That type of resolution produces clear images for reading text within virtual worlds and perusing environmental objects within games. A 90Hz refresh rate also reduces motion blur during abrupt head movements, precluding motion sickness that plagued other VR headsets at lower refresh rates.</p>
<p>Installation is easy and <span><strong>cableless</strong></span>: The Quest 3S is a self-contained headset, so all of your processing occurs within the headset itself, eliminating your need for a gaming PC. You charge it through USB-C, mark your play space boundary with controllers, and are playing within a few minutes. <strong>Batter life averages two to three hours</strong> depending on your activity.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage holds space for some 10 to 15 large games, depending on how large they are themselves. The physics-based <strong>multiplayer game Gorilla Tag, a game included here in this Amazon-only bundle</strong>, is incredibly popular among VR groups because after a little while of getting used to swinging your arms to build up speed, your movements end up feeling really intuitive. Themed cosmetic items for the game are included here as part of the Cardboard Hero bundle which means you can set your character before even getting going directly.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorilla Tag, y<strong>ou receive a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+</strong>, which grants access to more than 30 games through a rotating library. Games like Walkabout Mini Golf, Demeo, and Pistol Whip are offered, which allow for a change of pace directly without purchasing titles individually. New titles are released each month, so each month you have a new set of genres ranging from rhythm games through puzzle adventures to try out.</p>
<p>With games included at $249, Meta’s finally giving a real hardware discount on hardware actually delivering on promises of affordable mixed reality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill 2 Remake Coming to PlayStation Plus, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-coming-to-playstation-plus-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1318336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 Remake was delivered in scintillating fashion by Bloober Team. The reimagined horror classic smashed it in terms of sales and reviews, and PlayStation Plus subscribers could be in for an eerie Silent Hill 2 Remake treat.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> captured the heart and soul of the terrifying 2001 original. If you’ve been waiting for it to be on sale or come to a subscription service, then you might want to sign up for PlayStation Plus Extra, if reports are to be believed.</p>



<h2 id="h-ps-plus-users-could-be-getting-silent-hill-2-remake">PS Plus Users Could Be Getting Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Free fear. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Word of the Silent Hill 2 Remake coming to PlayStation Plus comes from billbil-kun over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p>



<p>In an exclusive report, they had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“According to our recent information, we can say that&nbsp;Silent Hill 2, the remake of&nbsp;Konami’s&nbsp;classic released in 2021,&nbsp;will join the PlayStation Extra game catalog in October 2025. Barring any last-minute surprises, the title&nbsp;should be available on October 21.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would make sense as a perfect Halloween treat. Furthermore, this announcement would come not long after the release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-has-already-sold-over-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill f</a>—another launch met with universal praise and interest. We can tell you that if you’ve not had the chance to play the Silent Hill 2 Remake, yes, you should.</p>



<p>From its unnerving atmosphere to deranged nurses, it’s exhilarating from start to finish. If you get scared easily, you might want to have a couch to hide behind on standby.</p>



<p>Are you hoping this claim is true? Do you have PS Plus Extra or Premium already? If not, will the addition of Silent Hill 2 Remake push you to upgrade your subscription? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/techtestapply" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fill out the form on Bungie's website to sign up</a> now through October 16 at 4 PM PT / 7 PM ET. PC players can sign up there or via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> starting on October 13.</p><h2><strong>What's the closed technical test all about?</strong></h2><p>Bungie has held multiple closed tests for Marathon before, this one is similar in its objectives, which is to help give Bungie feedback about how the game is coming together.</p><p>"This is an important checkpoint for us as we test our improvements since Alpha, including three maps, five runner shells, prox chat, re-tuned combat pacing, solo queue, deeper environmental storytelling, and more," the developer said.</p><h2><strong>Sounds like Marathon is not coming soon</strong></h2><p>Bungie said it will share an update on Marathon's development with everyone "in the coming months" after this newest closed technical test concludes. The fact that there won't be an update for months suggests Marathon may not release very soon.</p><p>Marathon was originally scheduled to launch on September 23, but the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed indefinitely back in June</a> to help give Bungie more time to shape and refine the experience.</p><p>Bungie owner Sony recently said it remains committed to pursuing live-service projects even amid some stumbles. The company said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">put new systems in place to help ensure Marathon doesn't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a></p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but Sony maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper-competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>Hulst did not, however, comment on the controversy surrounding Marathon as it relates to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">Bungie admitting it found stolen art assets in Marathon.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-tokyo-game-show-2025-hands-on-preview/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First revealed at the start of the year during Xbox’s Developer Direct, Team Ninja and PlatinumGames have been working on a sequel to their HD trilogy of the long-running Ninja Gaiden series, with the first new title in more than a decade. While protagonist Ryu Hayabusa is still a driving force behind the narrative, this upcoming character action title focuses on a new hero: Yakumo, a Raven clan ninja and descendant of the Dark Dragon, who has been an antagonist of the Hayabusa clan throughout most of the series’ lifetime.</p>



<p>Not one to shy away from excessive amounts of blood and dismemberment, NINJA GAIDEN 4 is among the bloodiest action games I’ve played in a long time. Land a finishing blow on an enemy soldier, and their limbs will fly off, accompanied by a gratuitous shower of blood. While getting bathed in blood might be a core mechanic to the game, ala SUDA51’s recent roguelike Hotel Barcelona, it’s enough to make a squeamish ninja dog want to find the accessibility options and turn the blood splatter off. Yakumo can take advantage of the liquid potential to power up his Bloodraven form, a technique unique to him and a first for the series to take blood and utilize it as an attacking tool.</p>



<p>Yakumo is just as proficient in the art of the blade as series veteran Ryu Hayabusa and can bring a variety into combat, from the trusty katana to a thrusting spear and heavier hammer. Yakumo can don a pair of weapons at a time, with the second of the set being used for blood-based counterattacks and combo finishers. I gravitated towards the thrusting sword, something more akin to a war rapier than the type you’d find in fencing, that would transform into a massive drill in its bloodied form. While this wasn’t as effective against groups of enemies at a time, I still had access to the series staple Flying Swallow maneuver to dispatch enemies surrounding Yakumo, but just outside of melee range.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outside of boss fights, Yakumo is rarely caught in one-on-one situations, with enemy grunts preferring to group up on the solitary ninja from all angles. A soft target lock makes it easy to angle your attacks mid-combo from an enemy from one side to the next before launching them into the air and continuing your attacks in an aerial combo. Yakumo can also throw shuriken to preserve his combo momentum and temporarily stun enemies as he runs in for the approach. Swapping between weapon sets is just a button press away, and Yakumo can swap from his thrusting sword to a massive staff to twirl about and continue the onslaught, depending on the situation. Having this weapon transform into a massive rocket-powered hammer means it can be the best tool for breaking an enemy’s guard and armor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as the modern series is known for, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a masterclass in fast-paced ninja action and giving the player a multitude of tools to try and survive among the higher difficulty compared to other character action games. Yakumo can bring a limited number of healing items to battle, but he can just as easily recover a large chunk of lost health by way of his bloodraven form to absorb at least a portion of the health he’s lost.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cyberpunk setting is something new for Ninja Gaiden and a natural evolution from the nighttime cityscapes that the modern trilogy showcased. Industrial grey buildings bathed in a curtain of constant nighttime rain and darker flooring and accents leave the perfect backdrop for the fast-paced combat to pop and not get lost in blurring the two together. While I personally would like to see a return to some of the more rustic landscapes of the Hayabusa Village, I would not be disappointed if the entirety of Ninja Gaiden 4 takes place in these futuristic cities.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 both surprised and delighted me with a challenge that I’ve found to be sorely missing from character action games of recent years. Besting the single boss of the Tokyo Game Show demo on the hardest difficulty available made me appreciate playing a far more aggressive playstyle and how the game allows players to adapt their fighting style differently to each type of enemy or boss. This was my first time getting to see Ninja Gaiden 4 firsthand, and it has already proven itself to be one of my most anticipated action titles of 2025. </p>



<p>The wait to play Ninja Gaiden 4 is nearly over, as the title <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-october-release-date-announced-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will launch across Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 21st</a> and will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass for the Ultimate tier.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> modders continue to dig deep into the bag of tools Larian gave them and unleash their creativity on mods which don't just remix existing bits of the game, but add entirely custom elements. While custom campaigns and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">new areas</a> rightly grab a lot of the headlines, custom companions have also been starting to arrive. The latest is a "cowboy wizard extraordinaire", a vocation that'll fit right in among the established party.</p>
<p>After all, people will likely be too busy staring at Withers' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8738">modded big naturals</a> to question whether cowboys are a thing in the Forgotten Realms.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This conjuring cattlehand is called Jason Altea, and according to his creator Magnetuning was actually the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10086">first custom Baldur's Gate 3 NPC to be given proper custom voiced dialogue</a>, back when modders were initially working out how far they could push messing around with the game's dialogue system.</p>
<p>He's now morphed into a fully fleshed-out party member <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10000?tab=description">released in alpha form</a>, with around 200 lines of custom voiced lines and a range of interactions that'll make him feel like a proper member of the base game's crew, right down to getting involved in some of their chats. Altea also has his own quest, custom gear, spot in most camps, and the ability to approve or disapprove of your actions. He also comes with a sewing kit that can modify gear to match his unique body type.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4928">ability to edit hirelings</a> has long been the easy way of making yourself a fairly rudimentary custom party member in BG3, as far as I can tell this might only be the second fully-blown new party member to arrive on Nexus Mods. Modder Queenplouton's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13529?tab=description">The Bloodletter</a> is one, but aside from that, most of what I've found in a quick check have <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12257">revolved around existing characters</a> or <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3415">animal familiars</a>. This <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18415">chest with teeth</a> may also count.</p><p>"Consider him in Early Access for the moment," Magnetuning wrote of Jason. "Some things in this initial release might be subject to change over time, he might not have as much reactivity as you'd expect yet, and you might run into bugs or edge cases I haven't accounted for. I put a list of known issues below, but please let me know if you run into anything else!"</p>
<p>They add that since Jason's an existing character they've previously written a <a href="https://herotune.itch.io/far-from-the-tree">visual novel</a> about, he's taken a bit of crowbarring into the established lore. So, maybe not one for the DnD purists.</p>
<p>If you fancy making orb bloke peeved by recruiting another wizard, the requirements to get this mod - dubbed A Candle In The Dark - are as follows: <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8295">AV Item Shipment Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16649">ImpUI_P8_Fork</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/353">P4 Patches</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/457">Tutorial Chest Summoning</a>.</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger’s Paradise Colosseum is packed full of battles to work through, which are crucial to completing The Great Omni Carnival side quest.</p>



<p>Unlocked by progressing through the main story, the Paradise Colosseum in Digimon Story: Time Stranger provides some of the toughest battles, so you’ll need to have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Personalities for each of your Digimon</a> and may require <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">using Digi-Eggs</a> to unlock new Digivolutions.</p>



<p>Whether you’re new to the Colosseum or want to know how many more battles you need to tick off, we’ve got all the details in this guide.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-great-omni-carnival-in-digimon-story-time-stranger">How to Complete The Great Omni Carnival in Digimon Story: Time Stranger</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to do. Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Great Omni Carnival in Digimon Story: Time Stranger is unlocked relatively early, though you won’t be able to complete it until near the end of your journey.</strong></p>



<p>Completing the Great Omni Carnival side quest requires defeating all of the Paradise Colosseum matches, many of which are among the hardest battles available in the game. Even when you’re levelled up and comfortable against most opponents, these battles will still cause you trouble.</p>



<p>Matches in the Colosseum aren’t immediately unlocked either. Instead, they become available in intervals when certain unlock requirements are met in <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/digimon/digimon-story-time-stranger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Stranger</a>, so you can’t sit down and grind all the battles immediately.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-paradise-colosseum-battles">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Paradise Colosseum Battles</h2>



<p><strong>There are 22 total Paradise Colosseum battles to take on in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, the majority of which are not available immediately.</strong></p>



<p>The first six battles are unlocked as soon as you gain access to the Colosseum, with the others then becoming available when previous battles are completed, side quests have been ticked off, or specific spots in the story have been reached.</p>



<p>To make it easier for you to keep track of completed battles, all the details of the Colosseum battles are in the table below.</p>

For Battlefield 6, the developers are focusing on an Open weapons setup where people can pick any weapon, regardless of their class. The traditional Battlefield setup was that every class has its own unique and exclusive weapons. People <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-battlefield-6-is-approaching-locked-vs-open-class-weapons/1100-6534752/" data-ref-id="1100-6534752">made a lot of noise about this and how they wanted a Closed setup</a>, but data from the beta--which offered Open and Closed playlists--suggests statistically small differences in preference.</p><p>"The vast majority of players, after trying both playlist types, chose to stick with Open weapons. This reinforces our belief that Open weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," the developer said in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We observed mostly identical class pick rates with 1-2% difference at most."</p>

            <p>Nintendo is seeking $4.5m in damages against a reddit moderator the company has accused of pirating its games.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed earlier this month with the US District Court for the Western District of Washington (thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a">OatmealDome</a>), and according to a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf">document</a>, Nintendo is accusing James Williams (known as "Archbox") of piracy having "facilitated a network of unauthorised 'shops'...that have offered to the public extensive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games for download."</p>
<p>Nintendo has accused Williams of copying and distributing its games, as well as actively promoting their distribution as a moderator on the SwitchPirates reddit group.</p>

<p>"Since 2019, Williams has been either directly or indirectly the owner, manager, operator, creator, administrator, supplier, and/or overseer of several online Pirate Shops, and has worked to actively promote these Pirate Shops to communities consisting of many thousands of individuals," the document reads.</p>
<p>Williams has been "instrumental in the planning, development, functioning, and proliferation" of these shops, while further promoting the shops, soliciting donations, and offering "technical advice and encouragement" through his position as moderator on reddit.</p>
<p>Further, Nintendo claimed Williams was "directly involved in creating, promoting, and  distributing the Circumvention Software to facilitate widespread use of the Pirate Shops".</p>
<p>Ahead of this lawsuit, Nintendo sent Williams a cease and desist letter back in March 2024. In response, Williams acknowledged his conduct violated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>'s rights and "stated that he would work with NOA to satisfy its demands". However, Nintendo claimed he did not agree to cease his conduct and denied involvement with the piracy shops.</p>
<p>"When NOA requested that Defendant confirm in writing that he would comply with NOA's demands, he became combative and uncooperative," said Nintendo.</p>
<p>Since then, some of the piracy shops (or their content) have become inaccessible, while Williams is also accused of deleting or hiding evidence relevant to Nintendo's claims (such as social media posts).</p>
<p>Nintendo sent Williams a final opportunity to comply in May 2024, to which he stated an attorney would be in contact with Nintendo. However, "NOA never received any such outreach, and its efforts to contact Defendant's purported counsel were ignored," the document reads.</p>
<p>As a result, Nintendo has requested a default judgement be granted against Williams, along with damages of $4.5m due to a number of violations including copyright infringement, trafficking in circumvention devices, and breach of contract.</p>
<p>"Here, the amount of money sufficient to remedy NOA's injury would be extremely difficult to quantify; but it is indisputable that such amount would be large," the document reads. "Therefore, the money at stake by this Motion is nowhere near an amount that would compensate NOA for the seriousness of Defendants' conduct."</p>
<p>This lawsuit is the latest in Nintendo's ongoing actions against piracy.</p>
<p>Back in March, Nintendo claimed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a> was "significant…for the entire games industry". Then, in July, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbi-says-its-now-seized-multiple-rom-piracy-sites-claims-downloads-resulted-in-170m-losses-in-just-three-months">FBI seized a number of ROM piracy sites</a> it claimed had seen cumulative downloads of 3.2m in just three months, representing "an estimated loss of $170m.</p>

              <p>Having all your games in one place is not as impossible as it might seem. But with modern games pushing 100GB or more, the built-in storage on the Xbox Series X or S just doesn’t go far. The easiest way to boost your storage capacity is by getting your hands on a dedicated expansion card like this one from Seagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">The massive 4TB version is now 24% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $380</a>. It’s the largest officially licensed Xbox expansion card available on the market, but the deal might not be around for too long. We recommend acting fast to grab yourself one while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Enough Capacity for All Your Favorite Titles</h2>
<p>This expansion card is built in partnership with Xbox, so you can expect it to match the performance of your console’s internal SSD. Xbox Velocity Architecture support makes for fast load times and sharp graphics without any slowdowns. You can also play the games directly from the card without needing to transfer files back and forth. Simply insert it into the expansion slot on the back of your Xbox Series X or S, and it’s ready to go – literally within minutes.</p>
<p>The 4TB storage capacity is enough to house all your treasured titles across four generations of Xbox consoles. So, whether you’re after the latest releases or still can’t part ways with your Xbox 360 favorites, this card has enough room to keep everything in one place. Quick Resume support lets you jump between several games without losing your progress, both from the internal SSD and the expansion card. The switch is quick and will be especially appreciated by players who rotate between different games. You could be playing as a single player one minute, and then jumping into action with your friends the next!</p>

<p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger has a long list of Digimon available to add to your collection, though some are harder to obtain than others and require Digi-Eggs to be unlocked.</p>



<p>Time Stranger has plenty to sink your teeth into, ranging from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-personality-guide-all-personalities-stat-boosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Digimon Personalities</a> that provide stat boosts to the exact requirements needed to Digivolve into specific forms. Naturally, it’s impossible to remember everything.</p>



<p>That’s where we come in, though, as we’ve got all the details on every Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Egg and how you can get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-digimon-story-time-stranger-digi-eggs">All Digimon Story: Time Stranger Digi-Eggs</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Egg Thief! Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 varieties of Digi-Egg in Digimon Story: Time Stranger, all of which must be crafted in order for them to be obtained.</strong></p>



<p>Materials for crafting are gathered in both the human world and digital world, so exploration is key, and you’ll also require specific Attachments for the crafting recipe. However, you can remove them from Digimon if they are already equipped to them.</p>



<p>Aside from that, you’ll also require a hefty amount of Yen, as each Digi-Egg requires 10,000 yen. These eggs don’t hatch either; instead, they’re used to unlock specific Digivolutions.</p>



<p>A full list of Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger and the required materials are shown in the table below. We’ve also detailed the Digivolutions they are needed for.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-digi-eggs-in-digimon-story-time-stranger">How to Get Digi-Eggs in Digimon Story: Time Stranger</h2>



<p><strong>Digi-Eggs only become available for crafting when you have unlocked Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop via story progress in the game.</strong></p>



<p>Defeating Volcanusmon during the Incoming Conflict main mission unlocks the Crafting Shop, which is then the necessary point to visit for crafting Digi-Eggs.</p>



<p>Once this point in the story has been met, you can freely return to Volcanusmon’s Crafting Shop at any time to craft Digi-Eggs.</p>

            <p>Mina the Hollower, the next game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight">Shovel Knight</a> developer Yacht Club Games, has been delayed but is "<em>so</em> close to being done".</p>
<p>The Zelda-like adventure was intended for release on 31st October, but has been pushed back without a new release date, though the developer has stated it "isn't a major delay" but just "a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine".</p>
<p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that. That's no hollow promise!" the studio stated.</p>

<p>"We don't want to announce another release date until it's submitted to platforms, so please hang tight as we reach the finish line."</p>
<p>Yacht Club Games made its name with celebrated platformer Shovel Knight, which spawned a number of spin-offs.</p>
<p>Mina the Hollower is a change of pace, featuring a top-down adventure style reminiscent of Game Boy Zelda game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-links-awakening">Link's Awakening</a> in a gothic, Castlevania-esque world.</p>
<p>It continues the studio's penchant for retro aesthetics, then. Victoria <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-the-fabled-hollow-knight-the-much-anticipated-bloodlines-2-and-more">checked out the demo on Switch 2</a> a couple of months back and loved it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world%E2%80%99s-horror-themed-%E2%80%98nighthaven%E2%80%99-season-looks-so-good-it-has-players-eager-to-dive-back-into-the-mmorpg.1318264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a year since <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New World: Aeternum</a>, the relaunch of Amazon's MMORPG that introduced console versions with cross-play and a lot more. The developers were certainly hoping to get a big boost to the active player base, but that didn't quite happen.</p>



<p>However, that might change next week with the upcoming debut of Season 10, which is already garnering a lot of interest among MMO fans. Admittedly, it's not the most exciting time in the genre; sure, there's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-qa-homesteads-new-elite-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2 expansion Visions of Eternity</a> due later this month, and ZeniMax will release the Writhing Wall event for The Elder Scrolls Online, while Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has opened the Alpha test of World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>. But all those games are pretty old (if not very, very old) at this point. The only new MMORPG release of the year will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/mmo-game-pax-dei-launches-october-16-available-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pax Dei's 1.0</a>, which, unfortunately, does not look like it will be ready for prime time when it comes to polish and features.</p>



<p>Compared to the aforementioned games, New World is undoubtedly much more recent, having launched in September 2021. Some of you will even remember that it was quite popular at first, with Jeff Bezos <a href="https://wccftech.com/jeff-bezos-praises-amazon-games-for-its-first-success-with-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applauding Amazon Game Studios for its first successful release</a>. That did not last due to a severe lack of content, which led players (myself included) to leave in droves.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="New World:  Dev Update - October 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8vvYpd_GKLI?start=183&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but the New World development team is slowly getting there, and the new season is very appealing. Nighthaven will introduce an eponymous new zone that, in a lengthy dev diary, was described as the game's largest and most vertical map, contrasting with previous additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-brimstone-sands-update-out-now-adds-a-new-zone-new-weapon-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brimstone Sands</a> (which was horizontal and barren). Visually, it is a love letter to classic horror with macabre, Eastern Europe-inspired aesthetics featuring towering castles, decrepit dungeons, and sweeping pine forests.</p>



<p>Not only does Nighthaven feature more points of interest, lore notes, and quests, it even adds some new interactive exploration and combat mechanics:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Falling Chandeliers:</strong> Shoot them to drop on enemies (or risk them falling on you), reinforcing "look up."</li>



<li><strong>Throwables and Flammables:</strong> Use torches or fire staffs to burn spider webs and rat nests, expanding on systems from Cutlass Keys' lightning fields.</li>



<li><strong>Doors and Secrets: </strong>Various doors (bookcase, metal, wooden, magic-locked) lead to hidden areas.</li>



<li><strong>Arcana Tarot System: </strong>Collect 22 major Arcana cards (with Aeternum twists) to unlock tarot towers, elite chests, and caches. Combines with ancient glyphs for puzzles; encourages exploration via jump pads instead of guides.</li>



<li><strong>New Exploration Elements:</strong> Swim through mazes, dodge lasers, use water jets/elevators for vertical traversal.</li>



<li><strong>Jump Pads:</strong> Borrowed from the OPR (Outpost Rush) mode for open-world traversal in the region.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are many horror-inspired creatures, from vampires to werewolves, bats, gargoyles, and even Frankenstein-inspired constructs, and a new story to follow, of course. But the most exciting additions to New World, at least for the long term, are arguably those that seek to expand the endgame.</p>



<p>First and foremost, there will be a new 10-man raid titled Isle of Night. This will be the new toughest PvE challenge in the game, featuring many new enemy types and three boss fights, each with unique mechanics to encourage group coordination. Amazon Game Studios is also adding a Catacombs mode where players venture into a procedurally generated dungeon with a countdown. Through a Catacombs run, they will obtain various power-ups and rewards and have to decide whether to keep going forward or exit before time runs out to retain the rewards. </p>



<p>Progression is getting a big shake-up as well. Level cap is increasing to 70, and the Gear Score is being raised from 725 to 800. Additionally, any Gear with Gear Score of 700 and more will be upgradeable all the way with the new Umbral system.</p>



<p>But there's more: gear can now have up to four empty sockets called Perk Charms, which are roughly split into four categories (offensive, defensive, skill, gems), allowing for greater build customization. Plus, the new gear from PvP, Catacombs, and the Isle of Night raid will feature set bonuses for the first time, making it even more important to get all the pieces in a set.</p>

<p>You need only <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/1o02qyg/is_new_world_back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">go to the MMORPG subreddit</a> to see that there are a lot of positive vibes among MMO fans about Nighthaven (which will go live on October 13 on PC and consoles) and New World as a whole. Could it be the start of a big comeback for Amazon's game? Hopefully, but even greater is the hope that the studio will have learned its lesson ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-once-again-in-production-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming The Lord of the Rings MMO they are making</a>.</p>

            <p>Right, it's time to get ahead of the game. Approach your router and force it to repeat the things Lightning McQueen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LaYn0541ro">says about speed</a> at the start of Cars, because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has a launch patch coming and it sounds like it'll be weighty. EA say "over 200 changes" will be dropping as part of it and have also teased some potential future additions in their latest beta learnings post.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way">said community update post</a>, EA said these 200 launch day tweaks are "focused on bug fixes, balance improvements, and polish for release". As a result, movement should feel more responsive, while the recoil of automatic weapons will be rebalanced and various gadgets have been tweaked.</p>
<p>Also among the list of changes the publishers have revealed here ahead of deploying the full notes on release are layout revision for Rush and Breakthrough maps "for better balance between attackers and defenders". Some improvements to the game's netcode should also "reduce desync, make time-to-death feel fairer, and address cases of invisible damage". Personally, I don't feel the time-to-death'll truly be fair until a person can live their entire natural lifespan within a Siege of Cairo skirmish, but this'll do for now.</p>
<p>While EA have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">already announced the stuff they'll be adding over the next few months as part of the shooter's first season</a>, they did also cheekily tease the potential return of some other features down the line. "Requests for naval warfare have not gone unnoticed, nor have the calls for a certain fan-favorite little helicopter, platoons, and more," they wrote.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>That's far from the only observation EA have made through 92 million-ish hours of beta testing. They plan to offer both single and mixed mode playlists, but note that "players favoured playlists with combined modes". They said that "there were no differences of note" in terms of time spent battling in open weapons playlists vs closed ones, but found that players tended to stick with the former once they'd tried both. "This reinforces our belief that Open Weapons is the right path forward for Battlefield 6," EA declared, but noted that closed playlists will still be on offer at launch.</p>
<p>So, Call of Duty-style freedom in terms of weapon choice for different classes getting more of the spotlight, rather than the more traditionally Battlefieldy emphasis on running with the specific gun type your class is aimed at excelling with. The publishers also add they didn't spot one particular weapon type becoming dominant in terms of pick rate, instead saying things were "well-distributed", which is promising for the variety of bullet you're shot by each match if accurate.</p>
<p>There we go. Now the final few days' wait for Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-release-time">full launch on October 10th</a> begin. If you can't stand five minutes without shootering, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/97-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-betas-early-cheaters-were-caught-within-30-minutes-of-sign-in-activision-say">ongoing beta</a> will <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes">run until October 9th</a>. It's like the two are trying to form their own mixed playlist.</p>

<p>Fortnite has a bunch of enjoyable modes and is regularly adding more, some of which prove to be extremely popular. Delulu certainly falls into that category, and we’ve got the full schedule of the mode.</p>



<p>Delulu mode in Fortnite introduced proximity chat to the game, leading to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-proximity-chat-led-to-thousands-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands being banned</a> over the first weekend of the mode, but those who have behaved have been able to enjoy a unique approach to Fortnite that allows for mid-game alliances and betrayals.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when you can next dive into Delulu in Fortnite, take a peek at the full schedule. </p>



<h2 id="h-is-delulu-still-in-fortnite">Is Delulu Still in Fortnite?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes, the Delulu mode is still available in Fortnite for a limited time, though the doors are not open 24/7.</strong></p>



<p>The mode was initially planned to be a limited-time mode, but has proven to be extremely popular and has been extended significantly. In fact, we know that the Delulu mode will be available until the end of 2025.</p>



<p>That is significant as Chapter 7 in Fortnite is due to kick-off in early December, so confirmation that the mode will be available for at least the first month after that huge update suggests Delulu could be a long-term addition.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-delulu-fortnite-schedule">Full Delulu Fortnite Schedule</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Delulu will be available every weekend until the end of 2025, starting at 6 AM PT on Friday and ending at 6 AM PT on Monday.</strong></p>



<p>Outside of these times, Delulu will not be available in Fortnite, so you’ll have to wait until the weekend calls to dive into the mode.</p>



<p>The table below shows the full Delulu schedule until the end of 2025.</p>
