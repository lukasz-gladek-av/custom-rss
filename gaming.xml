            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="savage raven neogrip review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4aeadfc5a44a8/savage-raven-neogrip-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Skull &amp; Co. released a very nice NeoGrip for the OLED Switch back in 2021, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we reviewed at the time</a>, coming away with the impression that, beyond a fiddly holding tab that could potentially get lost, the grips helped make long portable sessions much more comfortable.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 update, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/Savage%20Raven%20by%20Skull%20&amp;%20Co.%20NeoGrip%20for%20Nintendo%20Switch%202">Savage Raven by Skull &amp; Co. NeoGrip for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which falls under the same 'Savage Raven' banner as the company's excellent Switch 2 carry case (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering">which we've also reviewed!</a>), not much has really changed.</p>
<p>Once again, you're treated to a well-made, high-quality plastic sheath which the console slides securely into, before being fixed in place with a little tab. Your choice from three sets of grip styles are then clicked into place to complete the deal.</p>
<p>The design here, whilst almost entirely the same as the OLED accessory, has seen a little bit of clever revision with how its fixing tab now clicks into place using a switch that should see it stay secure at all times. You could still lose the little tab, mind, if you take it off then misplace it, however the older design also had the potential to clip off when it hit against things, so at least that issue has been solved this time out.</p>

<p>There are also no separate screws or screw holes for the OG Switch across the back of the plastic brace for this revision either, so it's a cleaner overall product design - albeit one that'll only fit your Switch 2. You can't win 'em all.</p>
<p>As mentioned, this NeoGrip pack comes with the console brace/sheath itself and three different types of grip. The middle-ground grip, which is fitted as default on the accessory, has ended up being the one that I am now using most of the time, as its angular top gives me somewhere to rest my fingers comfortably.</p>
<p>However, both the larger grips and the smallest flat ones are absolutely improvements on the default Joy Con's little grip bumps. I always end up either slipping off those or getting cramp, so I'm happy with the upgrade, thanks.</p>
<p>Indeed, I'm currently mid-review of a game, and for reviews I naturally tend to try to play as much on TV as possible, because I have stupid adult hands that get cramped up and sore in portable mode on Switch, Switch OLED, Switch 2...and a bunch of other handheld consoles. The mid-grips here have my hands feeling fine, with zero pins and needles or cramps detected, and that's after a full-on morning of playing without stops. Result!</p>

<p>As you can see from the pics, the colour used for the grips and brace is also a very, very close match for the console's stylish finish, so you aren't ruining your new tech's vibe at all, and even the bigger grip, with its bulbously rounded tops, looks fairly slim and slick from a side profile. One of my pet hates, no matter how nice an accessory feels, is when it cheapens the look of the console overall by being an off-colour that doesn't quite match, and that's not an issue here. I'd leave it on permanently if it weren't for the fact the Joy Con need to come off so often.</p>
<p>Luckily, it's so easy to take on and off — yes, even for a genuinely ancient moron such as myself — that I can see myself sliding this on every time I'm relaxing on the sofa for some Nintendo time. Which happens about 17 times a day, you understand.</p>

<p>And with regards to the console's dock, with the grips and brace attached, there's no issue for the Switch 2 sliding smoothly in and out, so you can leave it on when playing on the TV.</p>
<p>Overall, then, this one's an easy recommendation if you are looking for a little more purchase on your Switch 2 Joy Con in handheld mode, and an upgrade that's genuinely got my console feeling more like a nice fancy controller when I'm playing on the go.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-tone-deaf-hiring-call-ai-slop-microsoft-layoffs/">Xbox</a> has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/15/xbox-game-pass-july-2025-wave-2/">announced</a> the next batch of games being added to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-spends-50k-50m-to-get-games-onto-xbox-game-pass/">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service, with nine titles entering the service for subscribers for the month of July 2025, including Grounded 2, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Wheel World, RoboCop: Rogue City, and more.</p>



<p>Most of the games added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">Xbox Game Pass</a> this month aren't available today, as there are a few games launching directly into the service. The only 'new' game of sorts that players can jump into today with Game Pass, is High on Life, which is returning to the service after it was previously available and removed from the service. </p>



<p>Beginning on July 17, RoboCop: Rogue City and My Friendly Neighborhood are added to the service. For RoboCop, its arrival in Game Pass also lines up with the release of its brand new DLC, Unfinished Business, though the DLC is not available in the Game Pass version that subscribers will have access to. You'll still need to grab the DLC separately if you devour the base game before the month is up.</p>

Then on July 23, Wheel World, a new open-world bicycle game is also launching into the service, followed by yet another day-one launch into Game Pass with Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on July 24.</p>



<p>Grounded 2 then launches into early access on Steam and Game Preview on Xbox consoles on July 29, and July's additions are capped off by Farming Simulator 25 joining the service on August 1. Here's the full list of games getting added to Xbox Game Pass for the month of July 2025: </p>

Hopefully, this change remains when patch 1.2 arrives on other platforms in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/creepy-dark-brotherhood-door-oblivion-remastered-1-2-pc-1851786326]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">These features reinforce the first of what Tarno calls Rematch's four core overhaul pillars, defined as "social, core gameplay, competitive, and casual," per Eurogamer.</p><p dir="ltr">Players only became aware of Rematch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-wont-have-cross-play-options-ready-in-time-for-launch/1100-6532448/">missing cross-play functionality</a> a day prior to launch, when Sloclap shared the news on the game's social pages, clarifying at the time that it was one of its "top priorities for upcoming updates."</p><p dir="ltr">While there's still no concrete timing on cross-play's addition, Sloclap seems to understand how urgently Rematch's community wants the feature, but is currently fixing a lot of bugs while iterating on the game's foundation to "keep adding depth and granularity to the mechanics."</p><p dir="ltr">Tarno went on to list a slew of changes the team want to make to Rematch's most fundamental mechanics, like tweaking tackles to reward or punish players depending on their success and refining goalkeeping. Additionally, he and the team are already looking ahead to bigger features, like the implementation of clubs and tournaments, which are set to arrive sometime this year, and on the other end of the competitive spectrum, casual-friendly modes to complement Rematch's first season.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the volume of promises, Tarno didn't provide much in the way of dates though, seemingly stressing that the game's roadmap is a little fluid at the moment while the team works on addressing Rematch's balance and bugs.</p><p dir="ltr">Clearly these issues haven't held back Rematch's success, considering the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-a-soccer-game-from-the-developers-of-sifu-is-off-to-a-hot-start/1100-6532582/">reached a million unique players</a> and counting.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2: Edge of Fate</a> launches later today, but thanks to the opportunity to pre-load the expansion ahead of time, players have been able to hop into the title screen. It's there that longtime Destiny fans were welcomed with a blast from the past.</p>
<p>This nostalgia bomb comes courtesy of a music track that plays while on this title screen. The track is the main menu theme from the original Destiny! Originally composed by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori, it's been long absent from the series for years until now.</p>
<p>Destiny 2: Edge of Fate is the first in the game's Fate Saga, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">and the first in its new approach to major game expansions</a>. Rather than the massive updates that came with The Witch Queen or Beyond Light, now medium-sized updates will be coming twice a year.</p>

<p>It's also been stated by developers at Bungie that a major goal is to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-can-it-ever-win-lapsed-players-back">create a "more curated experience" for new players</a>. This has proven a major thorn in the side of Destiny 2 for some time, as older versions of the game have been vaulted forever alongside all the accompanying content. For example, new players can't experience the story of the base game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-unpopular-removal-of-older-game-content-now-hampering-bungies-ability-to-defend-plagiarism-lawsuit">something which has proved vexing for Bungie in recent legal battles</a>.</p>
<p>It's a good start for the Destiny 2 team, who are fighting to win back some positive sentiment for the game after a lengthy string of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-targeted-in-lawsuit-from-writer-who-says-bungie-copied-his-work">legal trouble</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-now-investigating-an-issue-with-rng-weapon-perks-days-after-telling-players-there-was-no-issue-at-all">embarrassing moments</a>. With Edge of Fate, the team has another chance to tempt people back. Whether it can remains to be seen.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-title-screen-blasts-fans-with-nostalgia-with-a-single-track]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA and DICE have been going about building anticipating for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the next Battlefield</a> in some fairly unusual ways. The game's title has yet to be officially announced, and no reveal - of any kind - has taken place, yet.</p>
<p>The people making the highly-anticipated shooter instead decided to run an invite-only testing environment - dubbed <a href="https://www.vg247.com/topics/battlefield-labs">Battlefield Labs</a> - and have that, well, do the talking. It's clear DICE and co wanted to get the people who care most about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/battlefield">Battlefield</a> involved as early as possible, because it's them who'd be more than happy to generate that word of mouth organically.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to keep in mind that those same people are more than happy to tell you when there's something they don't like, too - and that's a problem when what that is seems integral to the vision of the game.</p>

<p>If you've not been paying attention to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">any of the recent (and many) Battlefield 6 leaks</a>, the short version is that the game looks good! The art style is grounded, depicting gritty combat in environments where you expect it to take place. There's a big emphasis on destruction, combined arms gameplay, and a focus on bringing back <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-2042-128-players-massive-maps-reveal">the type of squad combat Battlefield 2042 abandoned in its attempt at Apex Legend-ifying the series</a>.</p>
<p>Crucial to the way a Battlefield game works is class co-dependency. In other words, each class is meant to perform a certain role, and it's only allowed to use certain weapons. It would be even better if each also had a distinct look and an easy-to-spot silhouette. Those inherent limitations give Battlefield's multiplayer its character, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is chipping away at - at least - some of that.</p>
<p>DICE first revealed its intentions to alter the way classes work in the next game nearly two months ago, when it first allowed Battlefield Labs participants to test out a version of the game where any player could use any weapon, regardless of their class.</p>
<p>DICE's language at the time was a little soft; seemingly <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-labs-weapon-class-restrictions-community-reaction">intended to massage what the developer knew would be an incredibly controversial change</a>. The studio's argument was that it's building in-game systems to incentivise players to stick to their chosen class' recommended weapon type - so called Signature Weapon - and that players would need to play with those systems implemented first before they pass judgement on the direction things are going.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Will EA improve on the reputation of the series post-2042? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As it happens, that conversation started with a blog post that had a telling "part one" at the end of its title, which signaled that things <em>could</em> change. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/news/battlefield-labs-the-class-system-part-two">second part of that blog post</a> has since gone up, confirming that DICE is sticking to its guns on this one.</p>
<p>The biggest reveal in the post is that each class in Battlefield 6 will have two Training Paths, effectively branching roles with passives that enhance your character. Each path is structured into three levels that you progress through in the match itself, similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a>'s Field Upgrades.</p>
<p>You get to immediately take advantage of level 0 of either track after you spawn, and you can expect a basic stat boost there. Levels 1 and 2 offer advantages specific to your class, and DICE says earning them can only be done through "teamplay progression and score XP." The third and final level is a single-use ability.</p>
<p>The progress rate and power of each node (and for each class) is what DICE is currently testing in Battlefield Labs. What's not changing, however, is that all weapons will be available for all classes. If you like the passives that come from using your chosen class' Signature Weapon, all the better - but the crux of this entire dilemma is that you can simply choose not to care.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>It's spent a while in the Labs, but we'll see it soon. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The arguments against this lack of weapon limitation are plentiful, and many of them are simply re-heated from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> pre-launch months. Players tend to land on one side over the other here, because of how fundamental class co-dependency - and the limitations therein -  are to what makes Battlefield, well, <em>Battlefield</em>.</p>
<p>More than what the change could do to Battlefield 6's gameplay, the general sense is that DICE developers are being "forced" into doing this by EA's upper management because it is seen as an instance of friction the game could do without.</p>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">wide-ranging Ars Technica report</a>, EA is betting the farm on the next Battlefield. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller">It wants to bring in 100 million players</a>, and it's going to offer multiple ways of accessing the game to entice the largest possible number of them.</p>
<p>It's impossible to divorce that design decision from the report. Class co-dependency, weapon and gadget limitations are often cited among the reasons why many players could never stick with the series; they're as integral to Battlefield as Killstreaks are to Call of Duty. <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-call-of-duty-salt-mines-with-battlefield-it-doesnt-make-sense">EA doesn't want anything less than its own Call of Duty factory</a>, and the publisher even <a href="https://www.vg247.com/battlefield-call-of-duty-general-manager-ea">went as far as hiring some of the higher ups who created that model</a> with Activision's shooter series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Can a refresh of old modes make a big impact? | <span>Image credit: <cite>EA</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The irony, of course, is that most players who tend to favour <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> have no problems listing all the many things that prevent them from having the same kind of fun in Battlefield, which means any one of the series' defining aspects may as well be significantly altered - or done away with entirely - in pursuit of taking away some friction.</p>
<p>There really is no way to tell how much that change will mess with the game's character, or whether or not it's even going to matter four, six or 12 months on from launch. For all we know, the game's rumoured battle royale mode may well be the mode that takes off and dethrones <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone-20">Warzone</a> as the go-to for casual players, leaving the core experience just to the Battlefield fans. Maybe then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-overhauls-specialists-with-new-class-like-system">DICE will have more reason to revamp that whole system</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/if-youre-worried-about-one-of-battlefield-6s-most-controversial-design-changes-dice-just-confirmed-your-fears]]></content:encoded>

<p>Knucklotec hands, to be precise</p>

<figure><a title="Goomba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a3d7311482435/goomba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/">Ask the Developer interview</a> all about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is now available for your perusal, and it's packed with anecdotes and info about the upcoming 3D platformer.</p>
<p>One particularly interesting nugget was that the concept of destruction was actually being worked on before development on Bananza officially began. In fact, one concept video shows that the team experimented by sticking hands onto a Goomba – more specifically, Knucklotec hands from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the team said:</p><div><figure data-videoid="Vb6JFhMsLFI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vb6JFhMsLFI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c2cb8oqkgip&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vb6JFhMsLFI" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So it wasn’t that the concept of destruction came first, and then you built a mechanic around it?</strong><br>
<strong><br>
Wataru</strong> <strong>Tanaka:</strong> No. Shortly after <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was released, we started running technical experiments with the idea of, “What kind of game do you get if everything in the environment is destructible?”</p>
<p><strong>Kenta</strong> <strong>Motokura:</strong> We even tried sticking arms on a Goomba.</p>
<p><strong>Tanaka:</strong> That's right, we did. (Laughs) In <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, there’s a boss called Knucklotec who attacks Mario with giant hands. The programmer who created him tried attaching those arms to a Goomba as an experiment. The Goomba could smash terrain, tear off pieces to use as weapons, and throw them. Those actions felt surprisingly satisfying, and we got a sense that this destruction-based gameplay could be a compelling core mechanic.</p>
<p><strong>Motokura:</strong> The results of our tests showed that destruction-based gameplay could work, and it was a good match for Donkey Kong’s enormous strength. We felt that the concept and the core gameplay had clicked into place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's a look at the concept video itself (courtesy of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social/post/3ltz2wbwelc2h">Stealth40K</a> on BlueSky):</p>

<p>It's a very barebones video, but you can certainly see how it would go on to inform the gameplay seen in Donkey Kong Bananza. It makes us wonder what other kind of concepts Nintendo has managed to stockpile in recent years, too. Just imagine the possibilities!</p>
<p>The same interview also revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/heres-what-donkey-kong-bananza-looked-like-on-switch-1">what Bananza had looked like when it was in development for the Switch 1</a>. The team stated that they had begun to think about moving the game to Switch 2 in 2021 after it became apparent that the improved specs would lead to more satisfying destruction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-is-the-mmorpg%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-out-on-october-28.1244214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, ArenaNet is announcing Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, the next expansion coming to the MMORPG after the final update <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-final-update-absolution-is-out-on-june-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released for the previous expansion, Janthir Wilds</a>.</p>



<p>As you might recall, ArenaNet <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-qa-arenanet-on-switch-to-yearly-expansions-secrets-of-the-obscure-learnings-and-2024-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">switched to a yearly expansion model</a>. As such, you can expect Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity to launch relatively soon, albeit a couple of months later than Janthir Wilds did in 2024, as Visions of Eternity will be available from October 28. The new expansion is already available for pre-purchase <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/visions-of-eternity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the official website</a> for $24.99, and includes a bundle of pre-purchase bonus items, including a Tropical Resin Kintsugi weapon set, a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist character title, a shared inventory slot, and a level 80 character boost. </p>



<p>The Deluxe Edition, priced at $49.99, comes with the standard edition bundle, plus another batch of exclusive items: a Castoran Tentacled skimmer skin, a set of Fairy’s Call Gathering Tools, an additional character slot, and an Identity Repair Kit. Finally, the Visions of Eternity Ultimate Edition (which costs $74.99) includes the exclusive Standard and Deluxe Edition items, plus 4,000 Gems, Guild Wars 2’s premium in-game store currency.</p>



<p>Guild Wars 2 Game Director Josh Davis said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Visions of Eternity continues our commitment to major yearly content expansions. Over a decade into the game’s life, we’re making improvements and enhancements to game modes and systems, expanding the horizon of Guild Wars 2’s gameplay. This expansion is offering up more elite specializations to further grow the possibilities for player customization and gameplay while becoming more seamlessly accessible across game modes and activities.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity - Announcement Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A4cdnrLCs-M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new narrative of Visions of Eternity begins with rumors of Castora, a fabled island allegedly rich with magic and ley energy, as told by the seafarers of Tyria. The Tyrian Alliance receives word that the Inquest, the infamous group of evil Asuran technology researchers, has been searching for the island of Castora. Together with allies willing to brave an unknown voyage, the Commander (the title of the player character in Guild Wars 2) sets off to discover the Inquest's goals and stop them before it's too late.</p>



<p>On day one, players will be able to explore two new maps in Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity, with two more coming throughout 2026 in post-launch updates alongside new Raid Encounters, a new Convergence, new rewards (including new earnable items in the Wizard's Vault), two extensions of the storyline, new legendary gear. </p>



<p>Each profession (the game's term for class) will receive a new Elite specialization, greatly increasing the amount of build options thanks to new traits and utility skills. As with the previous expansions, ArenaNet will open up beta access to the Elite specializations for a week, between August 20 and 27, to anyone with a game account.</p>

<p>The Skimmer aquatic mount will be expanded with three new Mastery lines. The housing-like Homestead system is also being augmented with a new plot on the sunny beaches of Castora and the brand new game-wide Homestead Layout feature, which will allow players to easily and quickly share their customized space with others, allowing a perfect duplicate of a construction (provided that the player has the requisite decorations).</p>



<p>When it comes to new gear, a legendary weapon and a legendary Aquabreather will be available on October 28, with a legendary ring, a legendary accessory, and another legendary weapon to be released in later patches. Of course, there will also be new armor and weapon sets and new Wizards Vault rewards, as mentioned above.</p>



<p>ArenaNet's parent company, NCSoft, may have more or less inadvertently <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-3-was-reportedly-greenlit-by-ncsoft-but-dont-get-too-excited-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advertised</a> that the studio is already working on Guild Wars 3, but if that's the case, they still have a big enough team to continue building Guild Wars 2.</p>

			<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-runescape-dragonwilds/">last week's announcement of the five games</a> that are getting support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation,<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/marvel-rivals-season-3-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-reflex/"> NVIDIA is back with a few more games</a> that are getting a boost in performance this week, thanks to Multi Frame Generation and NVIDIA Reflex, with Marvel Rivals, War Thunder, and RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business added to the list. </p>



<p>Just in time for the season 3 release in Marvel Rivals, players can enjoy a boost in performance thanks to DLSS 4, with NVIDIA claiming that players can see frame rates multiply by up to 5X, and get latency on their PC reduced by 55% with NVIDIA Reflex enabled. </p>



<p>If you're sporting an RTX 5090, then, according to NVIDIA, you'll be able to run through enemy players in Marvel Rivals at 450 FPS, with all of the game's settings maxed out and playing at 4K. RTX 5080 owners can get up to 330 FPS, RTX 5070 Ti players can get up to 290 FPS, and RTX 5070 players can achieve up to 230 FPS. The more you drop the resolution, the higher your frame rate will go, with even RTX 5060 cards capable of hitting 300 FPS when playing at 1080p. </p>



<p>War Thunder is another game that is adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation in its latest update, which players with RTX 50 series cards can take full advantage of, enabling ray tracing and cranking the settings to get the most detailed image at smooth frame rates. </p>



<p>Lastly, RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business, the DLC for the 2023 return of the robotic police officer that's due to release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-is-out-on-july-17/">just two days at the time of this writing</a>, will launch with the game adding support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation.</p>

It was this instruction, combined with ongoing experimentation into voxel-based destruction, that led to Donkey Kong Bananza's genesis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked how Bananza sits alongside other Donkey Kong games, Motokura continued by saying that the 3D Mario team considered this project to epitomise a new 3D Donkey Kong "branch", separate to the DK's 2D platformers — leaving the door open to both kinds of games still existing in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In a long-running series, novelty and continuity are both important, but we wanted this title to fully convey the appeal of Donkey Kong as a character," Motokura said. "Meanwhile, we thought that by creating something new, leveraging our experience developing 3D Mario games, we'd have the opportunity to create two separate branches – 2D Donkey Kong and 3D Donkey Kong – just as we did with Mario games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, keeping in mind that this game will come to symbolise 3D Donkey Kong, and with the theme of bringing Donkey Kong's strengths and new actions to the forefront, we thought the concept of 'destruction' would be a good fit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Motokura discussed Nintendo's recent Donkey Kong redesign in more detail, and said that it was the development of Bananza which spearheaded the company's search for a new DK look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Donkey Kong Bananza sparked the creation of a design which I think better conveys the new Donkey Kong," Motokura said, noting that Nintendo's new 'standard' DK was actually another attempt to recapture the character's original design, drawn by Shigeru Miyamoto for the Donkey Kong arcade game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Outside of this game, Donkey Kong has recently appeared in The Super Mario Bros. Movie released in 2023 and in Mario Kart World, but there's a basic character design which provided the foundation for those versions of Donkey Kong," Motokura concluded. "That basic Donkey Kong design has been completely revamped. While overhauling the design, we returned to where it had all started. We took Miyamoto-san's original Donkey Kong as the basis, adding design elements from Donkey Kong Bananza here and there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's next for Donkey Kong? Well, it certainly sounds like the door is being left open for the character to reappear in further 2D games in future. And then there's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-has-filed-a-copyright-notice-for-an-untitled-donkey-kong-motion-picture">intriguing copyright listing for an unannounced Donkey Kong movie</a>, spotted by Nintendo fans earlier this week.

Titled Visions of Eternity, it will have players setting sail for a mythical island, one where they'll be able to unlock a new beachside Homestead and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In Visions of Eternity, players will journey into the unknown to the fabled island of Castora, where they'll need to put a stop to a group of evildoers looking to use the island for their own nefarious ends.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4cdnrLCs-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A4cdnrLCs-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">On launch day, Visions of Eternity will add a swath of new features to the 13-year-old MMORPG, including two new maps to explore, new legendary weapons, updates to the Skimmer mount, new Homestead housing system features, and additional elite specializations for each profession to allow for more build possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">A fantasy beach house is one great reason to travel to Castora. Players will turn an island shipwreck into their island getaway, and new Homestead features will make it so players can quickly and easily share their housing creations so that they can instantly be recreated by others (as long as they have the requisite decorations).</p><p dir="ltr">This is the second Homestead for Guild Wars 2, after the game's previous expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-is-getting-player-housing-in-new-janthir-wilds-expansion/1100-6523933/" data-ref-id="1100-6523933">Janthir Wilds</a>, introduced the feature.

Pre-purchasing the $25 standard edition comes with various preorder bonus items like a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist titled, a shared inventory slot, and a level-80 character boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The $50 deluxe edition of Visions of Eternity includes the Castoran Tentacled Skimmer skin, an additional character slot, a set of Fairy's Call Gathering tools, and an identity repair kit.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Snapshot Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347080/Frosthaven/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frosthaven</a> (which I'll henceforth refer to as Frosthaven Digital) is a video game version of the tabletop game of the same name. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frosthaven/" data-ref-id="5000-542087">Frosthaven</a>'s predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gloomhaven/" data-ref-id="5000-485475">Gloomhaven</a>, got a similar digital version in 2021 (which was helmed by Flaming Fowl Studios). Unlike games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which adapt mechanics and themes from their tabletop inspirations (Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Cyberpunk RED, respectively) to create a unique gameplay experience, Frosthaven Digital is just Frosthaven--it's the board game minus the need to meet up with friends physically. For someone like me, who primarily hangs out with people virtually, Frosthaven Digital is a boon. I've wanted to introduce the board game to friends for a while, and this lets me without us all having to meet up in person to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital was well-received when it came out, and the fanbase has been eager to see Frosthaven make the jump to digital as well. Among the excitement, however, has been a recurring concern: Will Frosthaven Digital have an undo feature? In person, when you make a mistake while playing a tabletop game, the only thing stopping you from fixing it is you and your friends. That's not necessarily the case for a video game if there's no option to do so. In Gloomhaven Digital, it was possible to restart an entire encounter if you wanted, but there was no way to simply start your turn over or undo your last action. It was frustratingly awful, with misclicks resulting in a wasted turn. Fans have wondered if Frosthaven Digital will follow suit, and thankfully, it's not.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Undo] was the most requested feature [for] Gloomhaven," Frosthaven game director Hristo Petkov told me. "It [didn't] exist in Gloomhaven Digital, and according to our engineers, it was impossible [for Frosthaven Digital]. But yeah, we did it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital replicates the look and feel of the original board game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Frosthaven is a dark fantasy RPG that sees you and your fellow players become adventurers who find themselves in the snow-laden town of Frosthaven. Each character class has its own goals and abilities (portrayed as cards). In combat, each player plays two cards to determine what their character does on a turn, and moves through a scenario along a hexagonal grid. During missions, you can also find loot that you can bring back to town to build new structures or improve existing infrastructure, unlocking additional storylines and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Between scenarios, your team can rest to regain spent cards, but over time, you regain less and less. Once every card in your deck is gone for good, your character retires and becomes just another non-player character in town. You pick a new character class, grab their ability cards, and keep going, slowly building the legends of these different adventurers that came to Frosthaven. Your character can also just die, too, but in Frosthaven, most characters retire before succumbing to death.</p><p dir="ltr">Each session of the game takes about two to four hours, and an entire story campaign (if played once every week) will likely take you and your friends a few years to finish. It is a <em>commitment </em>to play this board game, one that should be easier to keep over a virtual call with no physical set-up, if Gloomhaven Digital is any indication. It's not a perfect replacement, though. In going digital, Gloomhaven Digital created new issues to overcome, like the aforementioned inability to undo a simple mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512"></a><figcaption>You'll return to town often to meet with other characters and build new infrastructure.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Normally, it shouldn't be [too hard] to do something like [an undo mechanic], but we used the code base of Gloomhaven as a starting point," Petkov said. "And [Flaming Fowl Studios'] code base wasn't really suited at all for this. So it basically was rewriting the whole thing. And one of our programmers found a way around it, but it wasn't easy. It took months upon months of work."</p><p dir="ltr">This undo feature is still in development and experimental, so Snapshot Games is looking to the upcoming early access release to see if what it has implemented fits what the fanbase has been asking for. The feature Petkov describes, however, sounds perfect, so I foresee it sticking around in the full version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can enable it in the options [in early access], because there might still be some bugs related to it," Petkov said of the undo feature. "It is pretty well tested--probably no problems with it--but we didn't want to put it in as the default for the beginning of early access. But this is quite amazing--it's not just an undo [for your last turn]. Let's say you are on turn five and in the middle of the round--you can actually undo every action to the beginning of battle. You can undo every single action [at any time]. It is pretty amazing. It works wonders. It was one of the biggest things we needed to do when we started."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Gloomhaven Digital, Frosthaven Digital seems like it will be a fairly authentic reimagining of the original board game. However, Snapshot Games is going a few steps further with its adaptation, implementing features that don't exist in the original board game but that make for a better video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of the changes that are made are cases where it's quite awkward or difficult to adapt the board game," CEO Julian Gollop told me. "Usually, this is [our] approach and [Frosthaven creator] Isaac [Childres] is generally quite accommodating to this, because he realizes we have to make some adaptations."</p><p dir="ltr">"We have a new tutorial that is three missions, and then we have a four-mission campaign that is the 'Road to Frosthaven,' that is basically created in cooperation with our designers and Isaac," Petkov added. "And the goal for this new campaign is actually to get people who know the board game [or have] played Gloomhaven a little bit [up to speed] on the new things for Frosthaven. They're completely new scenarios to the game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital will have a brand-new opening that acts as a prologue to the situations found in Frosthaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Frosthaven Digital will also have difficulty modes, allowing players to curate how challenging the experience is to play. "Frosthaven is pretty hard," Petkov said. "So we created a new difficulty that is basically breaking the rules of the board game. ...It allows you, when you rest--no matter if it's a short or long rest--to not lose cards. It makes it much easier. ...And you have double health--that also helps. From our observations, people who try this difficulty, they don't know about the game. They try the difficulty and they play at least four or five scenarios like this, and then when they feel more comfortable with the game, they can switch the difficulty and go to normal difficulty."</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I'm most looking forward to the artwork and character designs for long-established characters. During my conversation with Petkov and Gollop, they mentioned that though all of Frosthaven's major characters are well-known within the community, there are minor characters that have never been given unique tokens or cards or appeared in artwork for the game. These everyday citizens are being realized for the first time because they now exist in a video game, and not just in players' imaginations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEH2soLIYfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QEH2soLIYfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the main characters, we have illustrations for them. Some of the main bosses, we have illustrations for them," Petkov said. "But there are quite a lot of characters and environments from the board game that are just described. They're not in the board game, because in the board game, you use placeholder tokens for them--you use a guard token for the blacksmith. All of these are actually created [in Frosthaven Digital], reimagined with new 3D models."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it had a small Steam Next Fest demo, we'll get our first good look at Frosthaven Digital when it launches in early access on Steam and the Epic Games Store on July 31. The early access build starts with eight playable character classes (two of which you have to unlock), and about 40-50 hours of missions to play through. The full game will feature 17 playable character classes and will be a lot longer. "Frosthaven Digital has about 50% more content than Gloomhaven, and about double the complexity," Petkov said. "So it [will be] easily over 200 hours."</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital eventually made its way to Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch a few years after launching on PC. No such plans have been announced for Frosthaven Digital, but the possibility remains.</p>

                <p>Oblivion Remastered's latest update fixes an issue Elder Scrolls lore fans have been wondering about since the remaster's release, though the change isn't listed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Oblivion ahead</strong>. Those who have previously played the original Oblivion's Dark Brotherhood storyline will likely remember the intimidating door to the Dark Brotherhood's Cheydinhal sanctuary, which sports a relief depicting a woman (the Night Mother) raising a knife against her children. The Night Mother had five children she conceived with the god-like entity Sithis, which is backed up by the fact that inside the Night Mother's tomb in-game, there are skeletal remains of one adult and five children.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't what the Dark Brotherhood door in Oblivion Remastered looks like. Not only is it lacking the moody red lighting of the original, but it is actually lore-inaccurate as well. In the launch version of Oblivion Remastered, the door shows seven children instead of five.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a change that left Elder Scrolls lore scholars scratching their heads, but it turns out it was likely just a mistake and not a major lore ret-con. While it's not listed in the patch notes, those playing the latest patch Steam Beta 1.2 update have noticed the door has been changed. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastereds-latest-patch-stealthily-fixed-the-most-lore-breaking-door-in-videogames/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, it now sports a glowing red ambiance that more closely resembles the door from the original Oblivion and is now lore-accurate, depicting the original five children instead of seven.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest update to Oblivion Remastered isn't yet available for all platforms, but can be played early by those who own the game on Steam by opting into the game's Steam Beta version. In addition to the unlisted door change, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-next-update-will-add-a-brand-new-difficulty-option-full-patch-notes/1100-6533089/" data-ref-id="1100-6533089">update also adds a new difficulty option</a> and more performance optimizations.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">Oblivion Remastered's first major update</a> arrived in June and largely focused on addressing bugs and various technical issues. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, we said it is a worthy remaster, in part because it keeps many of the original Oblivion's rough edges that, if they were to be sanded down, would strip the open-world RPG of much of its charm.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - the Schrödinger's cat of video games in as much as its development appears to be simultaneously alive and dead - is set to reveal its delayed 2.3 update tomorrow, 16th July, with CD Projekt seemingly hinting at a vehicular focus.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's 2.3 update was originally announced in June, despite development on the game having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">technically wrapped up last year</a>, with a planned release toward the end of the month. However, its launch was ultimately pushed back to an undisclosed later point after CD Projekt decided it needed "more time".
</p>
<p>
As for what 2.3 will include, all the studio would say previously is that it was "aiming for a scope similar to" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-22-adds-new-secrets-expanded-customisation-options-and-more">last year's 2.2 release</a>. That, by way of comparison, introduced a variety of fixes and quality of life improvements, alongside an improved photo mode, new car and player customisations, plus a new selection of "most requested" vehicles for purchase via Autofixer. Oh, and there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">that Balatro collaboration</a> too.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to tomorrow's <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1945136315705467297">newly announced livestream</a>. It's airing at 5pm, 16th July, on <a href="https://t.co/crpXzrC6VR">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://t.co/6RhhKsU0xa">YouTube</a>, with appearances from Cyberpunk 2 associate game director Paweł Sasko and Adrien Jouannet, lead Designer at Virtuos. Rumours <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-cdpr-isnt-actually-finished-with-cyberpunk-2077-announces-another-update">Virtuous had been drafted in to work on some sort of Cyberpunk 2077 DLC</a> first surfaced back in June.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt's livestream announcement also features some very particular phrasing, strongly hinting this latest release will likely focus on vehicles. "We're driving into Patch 2.3 of Cyberpunk 2077 to check what's under the hood of the newest update," the studio wrote, before referring to the shows guests as "passengers" then wrapping up with a wheel emoji.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077 has, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-a-cutting-edge-game-translates-well-to-nintendos-console-hybrid">made an impressive debut on Switch 2</a>, and a sadder, bloodier, and darker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/when-people-are-sad-im-a-bit-happy-cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-two-is-going-to-be-sadder-bloodier-and-darker">second season of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> is also on the way. That's alongside Cyberpunk 2077's eagerly anticipated - albeit distant - sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">Cyberpunk 2</a>.

            <p>The Pokémon Company has announced that <a href="https://x.com/pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069?s=46">a Pokémon Presents livestream</a> will take place on 22nd July. This comes alongside a tease of Pikachu standing in front of what appears to be a DJ deck.</p>
<p>The stream will take place at 9pm JST, which is 5am PDT / 8am EDT / 1pm GMT / 2pm CEST. There's no word on what exactly will be shown, but given the teaser image one can assume it'll be some form of music-related game or service.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Pikachu has tried his hand at DJing in the past. He and Gengar have donned DJ attire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m8X3DBT_pio">at Universal Studios Japan as part of the Pokémon Halloween event</a>. Aside from that, there have been no music-focused Pokémon games, and neither Pikachu nor Gengar have shown up as DJs in card form.</p>

<p>So what's the deal here? Well, this is speculation, but one of two reveals seems likely. The longshot is a new music-focused Pokémon game that'll get revealed during the Pokémon Presents livestream. The other, a Pokémon music service. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-app-sees-mario-maker-take-on-spotify-and-youtube-playlists">Nintendo launched its own music app in October 2024</a>, and Pokémon is no stranger to banger tracks and catchy tunes.</p>
<p>That or it could be something totally different, and this teaser image has nothing to do with music whatsoever. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> the next big release in the series, one wouldn't be surprised to see an update for that game featured as part of this livestreamed event. Either way, we'll have to check it out live to know for sure!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>No ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off following the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/">Project Blackbird</a>, a new statement shared online confirmed.</p>



<p>ZOS United-CWA released a new statement on Bluesky yesterday, commenting on the cancellation of the project, which came as a shock to the 222 ZOSU-CWA developers working on it, and showing appreciation for the media and players that would have loved to see the game. Unlike what happened at other studios, which saw layoffs following the cancellation of their projects, no ZeniMax Online developer has been laid off. Although the future remains uncertain, as Microsoft and the union established in December 2024 are still discussing how the studio will move forward following the project closure, the developers who worked on Project Blackbird still remain at ZeniMax Online with full pay and benefits. Layoffs may still be in the future for some of the members of the union, but as a result of organizing, those impacted will be able to depart the studio with dignity.</p>







<p>As already mentioned, ZeniMax Online Project Blackbird is not the only project that Microsoft confirmed to have cancelled earlier this month. The Perfect Dark reboot announced back in 2020 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">ceased development</a>, and its development studio, The Initiative, has been shut down. Rare's Everwild was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">cancelled</a>, while other studios have been considerably downsized, such as Turn 10, the developer of the Forza Motorsport series, which has reportedly become a <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-dev-turn-10-support-forza-horizon/">Forza Horizon support studio.</a></p>

Many of 8BitDo’s recent controller releases, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a>, feature an asymmetrical joystick layout like Nintendo and Microsoft use. But the <a href="https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-3">new Pro 3</a> mirrors the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller, with side-by-side sticks that are now upgraded with drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR technology</a>. The Pro 3 is also 8BitDo’s first controller that lets you easily swap the arrangement of its ABXY buttons.</p><p>The 8BitDo Pro 2 launched at $49.99 four years ago, but the new Pro 3 is debuting with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFGQ6J35/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">slightly steeper $69.99 price</a>. 8BitDo has also switched to using a 1,000mAh rechargeable battery for the Pro 3, and while the company says it offers up to 20 hours of gameplay on a full charge, it’s not removable. The Pro 3 includes a convenient charging dock that doubles as storage for its 2.4GHz dongle. When the controller dies, it can still be used while connected to a console via USB, and it will charge while you play.</p><p>The Pro 3 is available for preorder starting today and officially will be on sale on August 12th. There are three color options, each of which matches different retro consoles: gray (PlayStation), G classic (Game Boy), and purple (GameCube).</p><p>The Pro 3’s design is nearly identical to the Pro 2, but it’s gained a few extra buttons. It carries forward the Pro 2’s back buttons while introducing an additional set of smaller shoulder buttons. Its triggers also use Hall effect sensors for improved accuracy and durability, while newly added switches let you choose a longer trigger for racing games or a shorter one for faster reaction times in FPS titles.</p><p>Compatibility includes support for Windows, Android, both Switch consoles (with waking capabilities), SteamOS (you can shake the controller to wake the OLED Steam Deck), and Apple’s hardware, with Bluetooth, USB, or wireless 2.4GHz connectivity.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Pro 3 includes a pair of ball-top caps that give it an arcade machine feel.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></span></p></section><p>Out of the box, the Pro 3 uses the Xbox’s button layout, but you can swap the A and B buttons to match Nintendo Switch controllers or rearrange them all to whatever layout you prefer. The Pro 3 works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software V2 so that you can remap the layout, and the controller can store and switch between three different custom profiles.</p><p>Although the ergonomics are questionable, 8BitDo is also including a pair of arcade-style ball-top caps that can be attached to the Pro 3’s joysticks.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/706967/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-bluetooth-controller-tmr-swappable-buttons]]></content:encoded>

Among the new toys for players to mess around with are an A/LAS-98 Laser Sentry that will blowup if it stays on for too long and a Dark Fluid jetpack that lets players warp short distances.

We’re now 18-months in, but Arrowhead has promised it has years of updates still planned.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-notes-control-group-warbond-1851786318]]></content:encoded>

The movie follows the long journey home of King Odysseus, played by Matt Damon, following the Trojan War while his son, played by Holland, looks for him and tries to figure out what happened to his old man. The movie reportedly has a budget of $250 million and is likely to be Nolan’s biggest film yet. Warner Bros. must be confident in <em>The Odyssey</em> or desperate to start making money off of it, because it’s reported that later this week, you’ll be able to buy tickets for the epic and unfinished film. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/7/14/the-odyssey-70mm-imax-tickets-are-going-on-sale-a-year-in-advance-this-thursday-july-17&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.worldofreel.com/blog/2025/7/14/the-odyssey-70mm-imax-tickets-are-going-on-sale-a-year-in-advance-this-thursday-july-17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 15, <em>World of Reel </em>reported</a></span> that some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://harkins.com/movies/the-odyssey-imax-70mm/2026-07-16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://harkins.com/movies/the-odyssey-imax-70mm/2026-07-16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMC, Harkins, and Cinemark theater locations</a></span> in select cities have started listing IMAX 70MM showtimes for <em>The Odyssey</em>, a little over a year before the film’s release. More showtimes will reportedly pop up over the next few days before WB officially starts selling tickets on Thursday, July 17, exactly a year before <em>The Odyssey</em>’s launch. </p><p>This is an unprecedented move by WB. Previously in 2012, the studio sold IMAX tickets for <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> about six months before that Nolan-directed sequel hit theaters. But with <em>The Odyssey</em>, WB seemingly isn’t even waiting for filming to wrap up before offering die-hard Nolan fans the option to buy IMAX tickets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/charlize-theron-old-guard-trilogy-odyssey-1236304226/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/charlize-theron-old-guard-trilogy-odyssey-1236304226/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At the end of this month, Charlize Theron</a></span> will film her scenes for the big-screen epic.</p><p> Knowing how rabid and loyal Nolan fans are, when tickets go on sale later this week most, if not all, of the film’s IMAX 70MM screenings will likely sell out, despite basic production on the movie not being finished.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, the next Switch 2 exclusive from Nintendo, launches in just two days on Thursday, July 17, and ahead of its release, Nintendo has released a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/">three-part interview series</a> with the game's leads. That's how we learned <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/you-can-skip-locations-and-parts-of-the-story-in-donkey-kong-bananza-thanks-to-the-games">you can skip locations and parts of the story in the game</a>, and why <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/15/donkey-kong-bananzas-destruction-gameplay-can-be-traced-back-to-a-goomba-with-arms">Donkey Kong Bananza's destruction gameplay can be traced back to a Goomba with arms</a>. It's also where we learned more about Nintendo's transition from developing Donkey Kong Bananza on Switch to Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked by the interviewer if Donkey Kong Bananza was planned as a Switch 2 game from the jump, producer Kenta Motokura explained that it began life as a Switch title, but was moved to Switch 2 around 2021 due to challenges the team (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/07/01/the-super-mario-odyssey-team-developed-donkey-kong-bananza">which also developed Super Mario Odyssey</a>) ran into. Art director Daisuke Watanabe chimed in to add, "We first looked into how we could upgrade what we'd originally built for Switch to take advantage of Switch 2.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vIDbh6D414" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"One of the most obvious improvements was that we could place far more objects in the environment than before. Being able to place more objects in the terrain didn't just enhance the game's visual richness. More importantly, it increased the amount of things players could destroy, which amplified the exhilaration of being able to demolish anything and everything. That went hand in hand with the game's core concept of destruction. It convinced us that this game would be even more fun if we developed it for Switch 2."&nbsp;</p><p>One of the game directors Wataru Tanaka followed Watanabe up, explaining that from a programmer's perspective, the voxel technology powering the destructible environments in Donkey Kong Bananza uses a lot of system memory, leading to challenges on Switch. With the game being in 3D, Tanaka said dimensions of textures and materials grow by up to eight times, compared to 2D pixels. "So doubling all three dimensions [width, height, and depth in voxels compared to width and height in pixels] gives you 2 x 2 x 2, or eight times the data," he said. "It may sound simple to just 'double something,' but the reality is that memory usage, voxel density, and all kinds of processes end up gobbling up eight times the resources. It was clear that the memory available on Switch would struggle to handle that load, and we felt that manifesting the huge volume of terrain that we did in this game might have been unachievable on that platform."&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the move to Switch 2, Tanaka said the team gained not only more memory to work with, but great processing capacity, too, giving the team more freedom to incorporate gameplay ideas it previously abandoned because they were too demanding. He also said the Switch 2 could not only handle the heavy processing requirements, but do so at 60 FPS. "Things we'd given up on, like explosions flinging large objects or causing them to collapse, were now possible," Tanaka added. "Designers could also place as many objects as they wanted. There were so many moments when we thought to ourselves, 'Now we can really do this.'"</p><p>Watanabe finished answering this question, explaining, "Not only did Switch 2 enable the game to run well, it unlocked the game's full potential –&nbsp; no, it made the game possible."&nbsp;</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches on Switch 2 this Thursday, July 17.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/07/01/our-impressions-after-two-hours-of-gameplay"><em>Game Informer's </em>hands-on preview impressions</a> after two hours with the game, and then check out this <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/ngt/2025/07/01/we-played-two-hours-of-donkey-kong-bananza-new-gameplay-today">Donkey Kong Bananza New Gameplay Today</a>.
