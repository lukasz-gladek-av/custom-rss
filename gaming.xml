			<p>Human staff have been the victim of recent layoffs over at Netflix as they begin to close down some of their game studios. This includes their triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, which was founded by Chacko Sonny, a former Overwatch Executive Producer. However, Netflix has decided to close this studio and has now admitted that the video game division of the company is investing in generative AI. This is supposedly to "accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players." This will come like an extra kick in the teeth for those who were part of the layoffs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/">the studio closure</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Mike Verdu, the Vice President at GenAI for Games at Netflix, used the post to announce his new title. "I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite certain how 'good' the AI is that is being used in game development. When it comes to generative AI that's used in artwork, it's still very obvious when the pictures are AI. Whether it be due to weird hands or same-face syndrome, there's always a level of uncanny valley. Whether this kind of thing will translate over to games as well is something that we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Verdu's statement continues with, "Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition," he says. Despite that, it doesn't make the fact that a studio has been shuttered and 35 people lost their jobs any better, especially if their plan is to replace their efforts with AI.</p>
<p>At this point it's uncertain what the plan is for the use of generative AI in the video game department over at Netflix. There is a lot of possibility and potential for it, as generative AI game engines are coming out, and the AI can be used to create concept art, voice performances, in-game dialogue and much more.</p>
<p>"I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams," says Verdu.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the use of AI in the games industry? Do you think this move will work out for the Netflix game department? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2869704">“Interactive Specials” page</a> lists 24 titles, but only four will remain: <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>, <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, <em>Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls</em>, and <em>You vs. Wild.</em></p><p>The removal of the titles marks a disappointing conclusion to Netflix’s earliest efforts into interactive content.

But the relatively few titles available suggests the format wasn’t much of a hit — <em>Puss in Book</em> has apparently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pussinboots/comments/1bsb2mm/is_puss_in_book_trapped_in_an_epic_tale_lost/">been gone for a while</a>. </p></div><p>“The technology served its purpose, but is now limiting as we focus on technological efforts in other areas,” spokesperson Chrissy Kelleher says.</p><div><p>The removals also follow former <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177141/netflixs-gaming-boss-is-moving-to-another-role-at-netflix-in-gaming">Netflix gaming boss Mike Verdu</a> — who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/">just announced</a> that he’s a VP of “GenAI for Games” at Netflix — telling <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sea-of-thieves-playstation"><em>Game File’s </em>Stephen Totilo</a> that the company wasn’t building interactive titles anymore.</p></div><p>The delistings are yet another example of Netflix struggling to find its footing in gaming.

From a service I’d check every week in case there were new gems to install, I’ve reached the point of forgetting to look for weeks on end, so lackluster has the cycle become. However, this month’s first batch of games offers a decent range that’ll certainly take up some of my SSD space.</p><p>The headline here is obviously <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, the follow-up to the genuinely excellent return to form in 2020 for Microsoft’s extraordinarily long-running flight sim franchise. The game releases on November 19 and is included in Game Pass as part of Microsoft’s promise to stick everything third-party on there. Although now it only appears at the new eye-watering $20 per month tier, introduced in time to catch the enthusiasm accompanying <em>Black Ops 6</em>'s arriving on the subscription. </p><p>Also added to Ultimate this month is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, a remake of 2014's extremely silly <em>GTA</em>-spoof, where you play as a rag-dolling goat. It joins the sequel, oh-so-hilariously named <em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, on Game Pass. Then there’s also <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, a spin-off from the beloved franchise, from a new studio and new publisher. It’s out tomorrow, November 5, so it’ll be on Game Pass then.</p><p>The “Standard” tier gets four games, also included for Premium payers. This really is a very decent selection of indie games, including the extremely funny <em>Turnip Boy Robs A Bank</em>, twin-stick shooter <em>Go Mecha Ball</em>, and claymation adventure <em>Harold Halibut</em>, all from this year. Then, the rather left-field arrival of the fantastic 2021 puzzle game, <em>The Rewinder</em>.</p><p>It’s an interesting demonstration of how Game Pass seems to work now. For the big ticket price, there are those brand-new, big-name games. But for the more reasonable Standard level, you’re introduced to really excellent games you might never have heard of otherwise.</p><p>Of course, there will be a second wave of announcements for Game Pass in November. Because short of yet another slip, <em>STALKER 2</em> is finally coming out, some two years later than planned and after <em>22 years</em> in development.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-reveals-why-the-game-was-delayed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay was recently addressed by the franchise’s Vice President Executive Producer, Marc-Alexis Côté. Côté addressed the franchise’s “inconsistency in quality” over the years and talked about “changing that narrative,” not just for the franchise but for the entirety of Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Bafta event yesterday, Marc-Alexis Côté was able to answer several questions regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay through an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. Côté started by acknowledging that “Ubisoft’s portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality.” He speaks about how the community wishes for “more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement” from the games they release, which is helping them “to be better”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Côté explains that by delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, they have the opportunity to “change that narrative, not just for Assassin’s Creed” but for the whole of Ubisoft. Côté expands, stating that the upcoming game “has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise’s storied history”; however,&nbsp; he knows that “being amongst the best is just not enough anymore.”</p>



<p>This is why Côté decided to delay the game. The playtests and feedback “made it clear” that the game has immense potential, but it needs more time to meet the players’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the “most ambitious and complex project” for the franchise, featuring “interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology” while being released across a larger number of platforms. With the delay, the developers can “polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise”. The decision will reflect their “commitment to delivering an experience worthy” of their players’ time and attention on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/empire-of-the-ants-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The beauty of nature never ceases to enthral us, and while many of its mysteries have been revealed by pesky scientists figuring out how stuff works, that hasn’t diminished its beauty or wonder. Empire of the Ants – based on the Bernard Werber novel of the same name – is the first game to fully capture that beauty and wonder on modern systems, bringing the insectoid kingdom to life in a way that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJDlwPZqv28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It will give you some insight into our household that the first few hours of Empire of the Ants were accompanied by hooting, hollering, whistling and gasping. Our now-teenage son has always been fascinated by ants and other bugs and creepy crawlies, and it’s an interest that’s spread throughout the house (at times quite literally when ants have escaped from his ant farm).</p>


<p>Empire of the Ants first and greatest trick is its visuals. Utilising Unreal Engine 5, it is nearly photorealistic, and the natural landscape of woods and gardens play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created.</p>
<p>The visual magic is enhanced by the audio, in particular the orchestral soundtrack, which lends itself perfectly to magnifying the sense of wonder and drama. It’s particularly high-quality, making Empire of the Ants feel as much like an animated film or an Attenborough documentary as it does a video game.</p>


<p>You play sister Ant 103,683rd – I didn’t know that all ants are female prior to playing, and that was only the first of many things I learned along the way – and you’re the ant that everyone seems to turn to in times of need. Bel-o-kan, your home colony, is consistently under attack by outside forces, or in need of expanding and protecting its territory, and you are a very singular ant amongst many.</p>
<p>There are different mission types for you to tackle in Empire of the Ants, with platforming and RTS sections the two main options. The RTS sections see you take command of a small legion of ants. At first, you have access to a couple of units, growing as you progress, and they’re made up of Workers, Gunners and Warriors, alongside different support units, before you start to unlock more powerful variants. There’s a nice combat triangle at work here, with different units strong against different enemy types, and if you want to maximise your efficiency you need to choose the right group for the job, while also thinking about positioning them in the most useful place.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you can’t launch every unit you have at a single one to overpower it, but eventually, you’ll see a clear downside to doing so. Rather than forcing you through a bunch of menus, all of the resource and upgrade tree is centred on your nests, with the UI appearing on the ground within them. You have to directly interact with them, which later on becomes a bit tiresome, but does make you feel an integral part of this ecosystem, and that these are real locations that you can directly affect.</p>

<p>The platforming sections are tricky, particularly if you’re attempting to catch something along the way, but they become easier if you think and behave more like an ant, feeling out your way across leaves and up stems rather than trying to rush across without any thought. They’re very rewarding when you get them right, and I never tired of leaping from rock to rock on my way to the destination, not least because of 103,683rd’s bum wiggling each time you do.</p>
<p>There a few foibles to Empire of the Ants that start to nag the longer you spend with the game. One of them is the visual presentation of the menus and UI, which just feel a little lifeless and low-rent compared to the stunning visuals in-game. The other is controlling your ant who, as an ant, is capable of sticking to whatever surface they’re walking on. This is great for traversing logs, branches, leaves and trees, but you can often find yourself upside down and turned around, and not quite sure which way is forward or back. You do get better at it, but it never completely goes away. Fortunately, neither of these things is a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>Empire of the Ants is largely a very tranquil game, punctuated by the more action-packed RTS sections. It’s often just you and nature, with the gentle music being replaced by the sounds of crickets and distant birdsong. I don’t think it’ll be for everyone, but I really enjoyed each section’s alternating atmosphere. That said, it doesn’t hold your hand, so you’re often left to explore and figure things out for yourself, which is actually refereshing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big sales barrier just a few months before the sequel is due to launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has sold eight million copies since launching back in 2018, which works out at more than a million copies a year (on average, at least; the studio doesn't break down when those sales occurred, of course).</p>

<p>This also means&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell around two million copies in around nine months; back in February, it was announced that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">crossed the six million mark</a>. Looks like Warhorse's RPG really is a steady seller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=Xx-RyetO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=4wRzL0CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>are (kingdom) coming along nicely.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s new sales milestone arrives as Warhorse gears up to release the sequel, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">announced back in April this year</a>&nbsp;(after being ignominiously and accidentally leaked by IGN, that is).</p>

<p>Originally due to arrive this year,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will instead be launching on February 11th; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">delayed back in August</a>&nbsp;owing to a need for "a tiny bit more time" on Warhorse's part.</p>

<p>When it does arrive, however,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is promising just as weighty and lengthy an RPG as its predecessor. In late August, it was revealed that the game's script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words">will have over two million words</a>, so if you like a lot of dialogue and text in your RPGs, you're in luck.</p>




<p>As for the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaimed-open-world-rpg-kingdom-come-deliverance-coming-to-nintendo-switch">ported to Nintendo Switch</a> earlier this year, which means it's now possible to play the RPG on all major platforms (and I'd recommend you do so if you want to be fully prepared for the followup).</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA07238_00-KCDGAME010000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance/BNBWFH89FCF1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel is due out on February 11th, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable">our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how it's shaping up.</p>

Every pack contains five cards, with disclosed odds about what’s likely to drop. A slowpoke or Rattata is many times more likely to appear than a Blastoise or Raichu. The special, more powerful EX cards of existing fan-favorites like Pikachu and an Mewtwo, and alt-art cards with larger illustrations, are especially hard to get. </p><p>But opening each booster pack is more than just a tap on the screen. <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will generate a bunch of booster packs at once in a virtual carousel and let you peruse them at your leisure, flipping them back and forth before you decide to pick one and swipe to rip off the top of the wrapper. That’s where a new mass conspiracy about “wrinkled” packs with “bent” corners comes in. </p><p>The theory took hold shortly after <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s launch on October 30, when viral posts began to claim that opening packs with visual irregularities in their virtual wrappers were giving them outsized numbers of rare and powerful <em>Pokémon</em> cards. Japanese X user Jedis_tm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was the first one I saw</a></span> to begin circulating the idea on October 31, encouraging players to scour their booster pack options for ones with any slight twists, wrinkles, or bent edges in the wrappers when the packs are rotated on their side:</p><p>Jedis_tm wasn’t completely convinced of the alleged discovery. “This may not be a guaranteed hit, so consider yourself lucky if you get it,” they wrote in a follow-up tweet, according to the platform’s translation. Even some who have mocked the idea as obviously bunk have been pulled in by the alluring possibility that maybe, just maybe, it does somehow impact the card pulling odds in their favor. “NVM IT’S NOT EVERY TIME,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another user. “Does seem to drastically increase hit rates though??”</p><p>Even people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the game’s subreddit</a></span> aren’t sure what to believe at the moment. “done it twice and got jack shit both times so idk,” wrote one player. “Definitely a better chance. Got 2 exs out of 4 curved packs,” responded another. Others believe the entire carousel doesn’t matter at all and that the cards in a pack are decided the second it’s selected. One player recently claimed to have seen everything their friend was going to pull <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by checking their Wonder Pick as it was happening</a></span>. </p><p>Anecdotal reports can’t really tell us anything meaningful about statistical probabilities on the whole, but it can activate that little voice in the back of your brain that says, “Well this is obviously completely made up...but what if it isn’t?” I’ve taken to checking every booster pack I open for wrinkles now, and have yet to get any startlingly good pulls that left me convinced it was making a difference. In fact, I’ve personally gotten more EX cards from packs I <em>didn’t</em> check beforehand for bent corners.</p><p>And yet I’m still doing it, because that’s what happens when people’s <em>Pokémon</em> fandom encounters the unintuitive black box of statistical mathematics. Even if there’s no truth to the conspiracy whatsoever, it makes the lizard part of my brain feel better while trying to navigate the whole probability-based encounter. It’s the same reason I still hop over cracks in the sidewalk and still held down the B button while trying to catch Gigantamax in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first set of new maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have been revealed. On Monday morning, the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1853467391688110288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> channels shared a teaser look at the three new maps coming to Black Ops 6 season 1. </p>



<p>The new maps are Heirloom, Hideout, and Extraction. </p>



<p>All of the maps will be available for 6v6 multiplayer gameplay. Heirloom, however, will also be available for 2v2 combat. More details about the maps will come closer to the start of Season 1, but the teases should give players an idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 1 will feature new maps, weapons, and other additions for all players. It’s set to kick off on November 14 with a full reveal happening shortly before.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is available now. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the game</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill said that “Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you&nbsp;just get it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>so much faster than previous titles.”</p>



<p>Check out the teaser below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can also take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

Tethered together, the characters can use their momentum to swing each other onto higher and higher ledges. But forget to anchor and if one falls they will pull the other down with them.</p><p>Solo players make their way up the mountain as Greg, who must use a rock on a rope (named Jeff), instead of a penguin pal, to swing his way uphill.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The question for players is whether those visual upgrades are worth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag</a>. That's why some of the developers behind Spider-Man 2 have contributed to a new video that shows off what the game looks like when run on the more powerful system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhReCdn5Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kAhReCdn5Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"When players play Marvel Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro, they are playing the quintessential version of the Spider-Man experience on the PlayStation 5," said Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar. As part of the demonstration, Intihar noted that players can send either Spider-Man swinging through New York at 60 frames per second without losing the clarity of graphics from the game's fidelity mode.</p><p>Senior art director Jacinda Chew added that Spider-Man 2 is filled with reflective surfaces, from water to the skyscraper windows, and even Spider-Man's goggles. Those are details that could easily be overlooked considering how much is happening on screen at any given moment in the game. With PS5 Pro, those reflections are much easier to notice and appreciate.</p><p>That still might not be enough to convince some players to make the leap to Sony's mid-generation update. But as far as Intihar is concerned, he's happy that players get to have the choice of how they want to play Spider-Man 2.</p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-overdesign-trap-of-game-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve played plenty of videogames at this point, and when it comes to originality in design, you can find that in the indie space, especially from first-time developers. The thought of being the first one to create X or take genre Y in a new direction is a promising concept and goal for many designers. However, it does represent one of the easiest traps you can fall into as a developer; new or veteran, when you overdesign a concept.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making a Triangle Wheel"><span>Making a Triangle Wheel</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I talk about overdesign, there are two distinct areas that designers will focus on. The first is doing something completely out of left field with a genre in order to distinguish it from everything else. I’ve said this line before — originality for the sake of being original. Game genres no matter which ones we’re talking about have foundational elements to them — a platformer is about jumping or some kind of motions, shooters are about shooting (duh), and we can keep going. There are elements you can bend to create a different spin, but there are some that you can’t break without breaking the concept of the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If I say that I’m making a first-person shooter, and the focus is on flying around collecting gems in first-person, then I didn’t make an FPS. Many games have tried to do the “my game is a combination of genre A and genre B” style of design. They often don’t realize that you’re not making a game for fans of A and B,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>but of A+B</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and that is an entirely different audience.</span></p><p>Metaphor’s subtle brilliance is streamlining and making SMT’s gameplay and JRPG design as approachable as possible (source steam)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You cannot work in a genre that you don’t understand, and why I harp on designers to play as many examples of a genre that they can find; all the good, and all the bad. Remember, complexity is different from depth — having a complex game does not mean it’s a deep one. Some of the best games released in 2024 have been those that figured out how to sell either a simple idea or a game that looks simple but there is way more going on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a very hard line to walk as a developer, especially a new one, trying to create something original, but still having to color within the lines in a manner of speaking.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="K.I.S.S. Design"><span>K.I.S.S. Design</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other way developers can overcomplicate their games is a literal example — taking something that is simple and easy to play and just throwing more and more on top of that. A good example of this I’ve seen is with the evolution of action commands in games. The action command, which the first case I can think of is from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario RPG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a way of providing more interactivity in turn-based combat. The benefits of it was to give the player the opportunity to reduce incoming damage and increase the damage they do to speed up combat.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9CLywUOprk" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I’ve seen from indie developers has been trying to elevate action commands and turn-based combat as a whole by making it more involved — adding in more systems and interactions during a fight. When I checked out games like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keylocker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and Ikenfell, they’re both very charming games that have horrible churn rates from the people who played them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the harshest lessons designers must learn is that more is not always better in the consumers’ eyes. A bane of good UI/UX are repetitive actions — something that the player has to be doing constantly in order to play a game. Having one heavily involved fight is fine; having every random encounter balloon out because of these mechanics is not. There should be a reward for figuring out a game, and just being able to play it normally doesn’t count.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve said this before and I’m saying it again: depth is not the same as complexity. If something takes five minutes to work vs. something that takes one, people are going to prefer the speedier option. To compare designs, when I tried out the demo for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a lot was done to speed up the press turn combat of the game and even reward the player for finishing fights without taking damage. The difference between&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and the other RPGs is that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;wants the player to get through combat as quickly as possible while retaining the depth of its design. The other RPGs create depth by slowing it down without providing anything else as a benefit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the past, I’ve talked about when complexity can work with the concept of “good jank” such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Getting Over It</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are some surprisingly satisfying games that are about taking something further than what other games would have done, such as&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What’s important to understand is that even if you are going for an involved experience, playing the game itself should not be hard to do. Good jank relies on only one part of your gameplay to be janky, if your entire game is hard to control or confusing, then you missed the mark.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing Design"><span>Balancing Design</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Great game design is often hard to land on for designers. There is always that allure to “go big” with your idea — create something no one has ever seen before that will earn you fame and fortune. When we talk about sustainable game design, that means knowing what you are capable of and building a game around that. The period in which designers could spend 5–10 years on a single dream project are behind us I’m afraid. Likewise, someone spending hours on a game to then decide if it’s for them are also gone. At most, you have the 2-hour period for a refund; at minimum, within 5–10 minutes of starting your game.</span></p><p>Balatro is proof that it’s better to provide depth under the surface of your game rather than hit the player all at once with it (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry continues to move fast and genres that are intentionally slow to play are finding themselves with a smaller and smaller consumer base. The fans are still there, but you can’t just throw money at a genre to create more of a fanbase. Speaking of the fans, this is also why playtesting is important when you are experimenting with something new because in the end, it doesn’t matter if you love your idea and think it’s perfect, when no one else can figure out how to play your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> won't just look like a modern game, but it will also play as one without taking away what makes the original unique, according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p>Speaking with Play magazine, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-dev-says-that-konami-wants-to-make-the-remake-feel-familiar-but-not-old-our-whole-goal-is-to-make-sure-that-it-still-feels-like-the-game-that-you-played-20-years-ago/">GamesRadar</a>, the series producer commented on the remake, saying that their whole game while remaking the third entry in the popular stealth series was to make sure it still felt like the original game without making it feel like an old game. Modernizing gameplay was also somewhat forced by the improved visuals, as some of the original gameplay elements did not fit well with the remade graphics.</p>
<p>The new control scheme featured in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater plays a rather important role in this regard, giving players the chance to experience the game like never before while allowing users to also experience the remake as if it were the original. Any other change was deemed unnecessary, as it would have taken people out of the original experience. The best outcome for the remake, according to Okamura-san, is for long-time fans to still feel nostalgic while playing it.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is still scheduled for a 2024 release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, although at this point, it's clear the game will not be released this year. We will keep you updated as soon as possible on when the game launches, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

A fresh rundown by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tech analysts <em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span> highlighted three previously undisclosed details:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>a power supply rated for a maximum 390W</li><li> 16.7 teraflop custom AMD Radeon GPU</li><li>2GB of additional DDR5 RAM</li></ul><p>So what does this mean? Digital Foundry notes that the power consumption is up from the 340W-rated base PS5, meaning the console might be a bit of a power hog. We’ll see how efficiency settings salvage people’s energy bills. It also points out that the 16.7 teraflops is lower than previous leaks (but higher than the base console’s 10.23), while the addition of 2GB RAM is higher. Ultimately, the devil will be in how well the PS5 Pro can leverage a custom configuration and new PSSR upscaling tech to deliver results above and beyond what an off-the-shelf PC is capable of at a similar price point.</p><p>Sony, meanwhile, finally gave the full list of over 50 games that PS5 Pro owners will be able to checkout at launch and see these beefier specs and upscaling in action.

All three games are technically impressive showpieces that also sport incredible environments and overall art design. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhance-mode-last-us-alan-wake-lies-p-4k-60fps-1851678765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhance-mode-last-us-alan-wake-lies-p-4k-60fps-1851678765">The ray-tracing in Remedy Entertainment’s horror thriller</a></span> looks particularly stunning so far. </p><p>But there are also some notable absences on the list. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, which is an exclusive with notable framerate issues, doesn’t seem to be getting a PS5 Pro enhanced mode yet. And<em> Returnal</em>, Housemarque’s excellent 2021 roguelike space shooter, is also missing. <em>Elden Ring</em>, one of the best selling and most critically acclaimed games of the past few years,  doesn’t appear to have any upgrades at launch either. </p><p>While PS5 Pro enhanced modes let games take advantage of better framerates, resolutions, and texture density, developers also need to put in the work to make those upgrades happen. It’s possible many of the above games will see their improvements begin rolling out in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, even regular games should get some overall performance stability boosts from the more powerful PS5 Pro hardware. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement came in the same breath that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Sony announced a PC version of Spider-Man 2</u></a> launches in January — one of the quickest turnarounds from single-player PS5 exclusive to PC from the company so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review"><u>Spider-Man 2 review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s next? While Insomniac has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Wolverine game</u></a> in the works, fans are hoping the developer will also release a Marvel’s Spider-Man spinoff similar in scope to the hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales"><u>Miles Morales standalone</u></a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-todd-tells-fans-insomniac-used-only-10-of-his-venom-dialogue-in-marvels-spider-man-2"><u>Venom the potential focus</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-on-ps5-pro-has-a-40-increase-in-pixel-density-dev-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> has launched update 1.6, which adds a “more refined” tutorial and further performance improvements and gameplay balancing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of the Fallen is a dark fantasy RPG released in 2023 as a sequel/reboot of the 2014 original. Taking inspiration from the Dark Souls games, it tells the story of fabled Dark Crusaders who must embark on an epic quest to overthrow Adyr, the demon God.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our 8/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-review-2023"><u>Lords of the Fallen review</u></a>, IGN said: "Lords of the Fallen is an awesome Soulslike with a fantastic dual-realities premise, even when performance shortcomings and wimpy bosses crash the party."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lords of the Fallen Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Hexworks also added a “more exploration-friendly” Umbral realm with update 1.6, as well as enhancements to take advantage of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which comes out November 7. Patch notes are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexworks said Lords of the Fallen on PS5 Pro has a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode running at 4K60 based on 1440p, and Quality Mode running at a native 4K30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>With version 1.6, new Lords of the Fallen players are more empowered on their journey across Mournstead, with a series of changes during the early part of the game. These include a more gradual onboarding into the Umbral Lamp’s unique abilities, and improved navigation in the tutorial area.<br>As for the wider community, a highly-sought player request has been the ability to more thoroughly explore Umbral – the game’s secondary, darker realm that runs alongside its core world. While retaining its dark allure and tension, the changes – which include subtler soundscapes, an adjusted enemy spawn curve for improved pacing, and reduced vignette effect - all combine to better support exploration of the Umbral.<br>Rounding off the update is a raft of additional performance updates and further difficulty adjustments, including mob redistribution, adjusted ranged enemy perception, and improved platforming. Full patch notes are available to read.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Lords of the Fallen Update v.1.6.12 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented further gameplay adjustments informed by community feedback and extensive playtesting. It’s rewarding to see our Steam ‘Recent Review’ score rising, reflecting the positive impact of these ongoing improvements, and we’re committed to continuing this journey with your valuable input.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mob Density:</strong> Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed via NG+ modifiers.)</li><li><strong>Ranged Enemies:</strong> We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li><li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li><li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics, particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li><li><strong>Attack Displacement:</strong> Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and supporting your playstyle.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Enhanced Tutorialisation, Onboarding, and Start-Up Experience</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve taken steps to further enrich the onboarding experience for new players in Lords of the Fallen, building on feedback from our veteran Lampbearers. We want every new player to feel empowered on their journey, and we understand that some early tutorials may have presented a steep learning curve. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved Lighting in the Defiled Sepulchre:</strong> Enhanced lighting and visual adjustments make this initial tutorial area clearer and easier to navigate.</li><li><strong>Gradual Umbral Tutorialization:</strong> Core abilities like ‘soulflay’ and ‘syphoning’ now have dedicated tutorial spaces later in Redcopse, allowing new players to engage with each feature more gradually.</li><li><strong>Simplified First Jump Tutorial:</strong> We’ve refined the jump tutorial to be more accessible (hands up in the comments if you cleared it on the first attempt!).</li><li><strong>Lightreaper Boss Adjustment in NG0:</strong> To clarify the intentional design of this encounter, we’ve removed the Lightreaper boss fight from the tutorial area for NG0 players. Rest assured: the Lightreaper still lurks within Mournstead and will make a return as a surprise in NG+.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A More Immersive Umbral Realm for Explorers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbral, the parallel realm intertwined with the living world of Axiom, is accessible at any point in the game, offering an expansive world of alternate pathways, hidden treasures, and secrets. We know how much you enjoy exploring Mournstead, and many of you have asked for a more exploration-friendly Umbral realm. Embracing this idea, we’ve made some tweaks to enhance its immersive vibe while preserving its mysterious, challenging nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Umbral remains intentionally hostile, we’ve made adjustments to its sounds, visuals, and enemy spawn curve. Now, the threads (Umbral natives) are slower to detect your presence, allowing you some precious time to explore before the realm’s haunting intensifies. Eventually, the Scarlet Shadow will appear, forcing you to decide: escape or engage in an epic showdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes make Umbral better suited for exploration while preserving its eerie intensity and challenging atmosphere:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dynamic Ambient Sound:</strong> Initial entry into Umbral is now accompanied by subtler soundscapes, building in intensity as you remain longer, reaching a crescendo before you must find an exit, or risk facing the Crimson Reaper.</li><li><strong>Adjusted Enemy Spawn Curve:</strong> Enemy appearances are now better paced to create a smoother, gradual build-up of tension.</li><li><strong>Increased Delay for Scarlet Shadow:</strong> You’ll now have more time to explore before the Scarlet Shadow emerges, enhancing the suspense.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vignette Effect:</strong> Based on player feedback, the vignette effect has been softened to improve visibility while exploring Umbral.</li><li><strong>Clearer Umbral Eggs:</strong> We’ve added a special VFX to eggs set to spawn Umbral natives, as we noticed some players had difficulty distinguishing between active and inactive ones.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">These updates create a richer exploration experience within Umbral, preserving its dark allure and escalating tension for daring adventurers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented additional performance enhancements across several of the game’s more graphically demanding areas, optimising the experience for players with lower-spec computers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Challengers Incoming!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Lords of the Fallen now fully harnessing the power of the PS5 Pro, prepare for a fresh wave of cross-players venturing into Mournstead! Be sure to welcome them - whether with a warm salute in co-op or the cold edge of your blade in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside ongoing support for Lords of the Fallen, Hexworks is working on a sequel due for release at some point in 2026. Publisher CI Games has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-2-enters-full-development-as-ci-games-reveals-new-details">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> (for lack of an official name) will have a "more commercial" art style and narrative, suggesting it wants the game to have more mainstream appeal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CI Games also promised gameplay improvements, more game mode options, and full "shared-progression" co-op alongside the "core" single-player campaign, all developed with "elevated production values" fueled by Unreal Engine 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher confirmed it had received a "major investment" from Epic Games for PC exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, which means Lords of the Fallen 2 will not initially launch on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance. Walmart, for example, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">announced its official sale</a> for November 11 this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.
