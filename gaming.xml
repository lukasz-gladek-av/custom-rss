            <p>Having Mario Kart World include a roster of characters from other Nintendo series would have been "incongruous".</p>
<p>That's according to Mario Kart World producer Kosuke Yabuki, who recently discussed why the likes of Legend of Zelda's silent hero Link and Animal Crossing's Isabelle weren't part of the game's line up of racers, as they were in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>, Yabuki told Ouest-France the inclusion of characters from other games in the Mario Kart World universe would have been both "incongruous" and, quite simply, unnecessary.</p>
<p>"It didn't seem necessary, given everything we could already do with Mario," Yabuki <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">told the publication</a> (via machine translation). "We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this cast. But there are so many characters and so many costumes that there's sure to be something for everyone."</p>
<p>Now, this isn't to say that Mario Kart World doesn't include new characters along with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Peach, Bowser, Luigi and other regular faces in the Switch 2's launch title</a>. It's just that these characters - such as the Piantas from Sunshine and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cows-are-taking-over-mario-kart-world">course the Moo Moo Meadows Cow</a> - are <em>already </em>part of the Mario universe.</p>
<p>Yabuki said the Mario Kart World team always hoped these characters would "be a good surprise for players", and the "welcome was so warm that it surprised even us". As for the developer's personal favourite racer, well like us the producer has a bit of a soft spot for Cow.</p>

<p>Nintendo's approach is in contrast to Sega's forthcoming rival <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a>, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">include plenty of characters from outside the Sonic universe</a> - including Hatsune Miku, Steve from Minecraft, and Spongebob Squarepants.</p>
<p>If you are still on the fence about giving Mario Kart World a spin, be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">sure to check out Eurogamer's review</a>, where our Tom said how the game "offers neat twists on the classic Mario Kart formula", calling it all "entertaining, snackable, fun".</p>
<p>Or, if you are already familiar with the bones of Mario Kart World, but need a little hand to get a bit more out of it (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unlocking-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world-is-so-obtuse-even-nintendo-got-the-details-wrong">like unlocking that infamous Mirror Mode</a>, for example), you can check out our guides.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 display is problematic in a number of ways, and it's even worse than its predecessor's in certain scenarios, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Around two weeks after the system launched in most of the world, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> shared a two-hour-long review of the Nintendo Switch 2, going over every aspect of the system in great detail. Being the first Nintendo system to offer features that have become widely adopted in handheld devices since the launch of the original Switch, great attention has been reserved for the system's display, and the verdict is not good, as the display proved to be problematic in a number of ways. As already <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">highlighted</a> earlier this month, HDR support is extremely disappointing, as an edge-lit LCD that barely tops out at 420 will never deliver anything like a decent high dynamic range. Motion quality is possibly even more disappointing, as its blurring characteristics easily make the new system's panel worse than the original Switch's display. The difference in quality becomes even more evident when comparing the Nintendo Switch 2's display with the Switch OLED panel.</p>
<p>It's not just HDR and motion quality that disappoint in the Nintendo Switch 2 display, but also VRR support. There's reason to believe, however, that VRR support could be improved in the future, as Digital Foundry highlighted how Welcome Tour reveals support for LFC, low frame-rate compensation, which should improve the experience when hitting framerates outside the 40- 120Hz VRR window.</p>

<p>Though its display disappoints, the Nintendo Switch 2 is a clear upgrade over its predecessor in every possible way. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

<p>Bricking it</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="mig bans" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b279277ed479/mig-bans.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As we reported <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-reportedly-banning-switch-2s-using-mig-cartridges">last week</a>, Nintendo has been banning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> consoles from using online services if it finds them to be using MiG carts, effectively 'bricking' the new consoles by denying them any online access whatsoever.</p>
<p>Nintendo has seemingly decided to come down tough on this issue for its new generation of system, with social media and internet forums slowly coming alive with users who've been faced with an “Error Code: 2124-4508” message. However, a potential knock-on effect is that the secondhand market for Switch 2 consoles may be becoming a bit of a dodgy death run for those seeking a cheaper option on Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/used-nintendo-switch-2-bricked-3569050/">Android Authority</a>, at least one potential Switch 2 owner has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lew6m5/found_one_didnt_end_well">shown up online</a> to report that their console, bought at a discount, was actually 'bricked' with the same error code message. Not ideal.</p>

<p>Piracy has been a scourge for Nintendo, particularly over the past few years with some high-profile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/watch-out-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-leaks-are-out-in-the-wild">pre-release leaks</a>. With carts such as the MiG providing a route to play ripped, pirated copies of games, it's perhaps inevitable that potential buyers are going to have to be extra careful going forward.</p>
<p>In the case above, where the console was bought at a Walmart, it was an easy case of returning the console for a refund without an issue. Start getting these problems with tech bought on the likes of eBay, Gumtree, or other sites, though, and forking out for a secondhand Switch 2 could end up being quite the sweat-inducing prospect.</p>
<p>Will potential Switch 2 owners need to work out some way of having proof provided by private sellers? If the online banning continues as it appears it has done in these early days, we'll be hearing more about this problem as a mountain of bricked hardware begins to pile up.</p>
<p>For stores, too, how do they verify that a console isn't 'bricked' before they accept a return? There's a lot of potential verification time to be spent on an extra layer of checks on returned goods.</p>
<p>Either way, we'll be sure to keep you updated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-says-large-scale-development-is-no-longer-sustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help.1225530/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-smash-bros-ultimate-best-ever/">Super Smash Bros. series</a> creator Masahiro Sakurai thinks that generative AI can help in a time when large-scale development has become unsustainable for various reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434?page=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ITmedia</a>, the creator of one of the most beloved Nintendo franchises ever made commented on the current game development landscape, saying that large-scale development is increasing in size, and is now time-consuming and unsustainable, so much so that Sakurai-san feels that things cannot continue the way they are. Game development has to change, and one of the solutions to this issue is using generative AI, which can be used to improve efficiency. Ultimately, according to Sakurai-san, we have reached an era where only companies that can adapt to this sustainability problem can survive.</p>
<p>While Masahiro Sakurai's statement could be interpreted as a full-on endorsement of the use of generative AI in game development, ResetERA forums member sprsk <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/masahiro-sakurai-believes-generative-ai-may-be-the-only-way-to-sustain-large-scale-game-development.1225143/#post-141809601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a bit of context related to the Japanese game development landscape. According to the user, the talent pool in Japan is getting smaller and smaller, and so there are not enough developers to sustain large-scale development, thus, using generative AI could help in a scenario where there are not enough developers. The user added that hiring from overseas could be a solution, but the language barrier will always be a problem, making it difficult to fill the gaps in talent in Japan this way.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time a high-profile Nintendo developer, such as the Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, has commented on generative AI use in game development. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto weighed in on the matter, highlighting how Nintendo tends to go the opposite direction the industry as a whole goes, directly referencing the AI craze that is increasingly threatening jobs in game development.</p>

                <p>Last year, CD Projekt Red unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> and confirmed that Ciri is the game's new main character. This shouldn't have been to surprising to fans after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, but there has been some pushback from players who don't want Geralt of Rivia to take a backseat to his adoptive daughter. Now, one of the developers behind the upcoming game is asking fans to wait for The Witcher 4 to be released before passing judgment on Ciri's time in the spotlight.</p><p>"When the game will be out, you'll be able to see for yourself and fully embrace her character, her story," said The Witcher 4 engineering production manager Jan Hermanowicz during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-dev-says-its-very-clear-that-ciri-is-the-right-choice-of-protagonist-but-that-players-shouldnt-make-opinions-until-the-game-is-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>. "And I think that will be the moment to make opinions and make the calls."</p><p>He went on to add that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">the first teaser trailer for the game</a> showed Ciri in "two emotional states [that were] very distinct from one another," before adding that the finished game will have a more rounded out depiction of her personality. Hermanowicz also echoed Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle by pointing out that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-woke-for-starring-ciri-geralt-voice-actor-says/1100-6531680/" data-ref-id="1100-6531680">original Witcher stories set up Ciri to be the lead</a>.</p><p>"For me, personally, reading the books, it's very clear that the story slowly transitions from being Geralt's story to really being Ciri's story, sometimes narrated through the eyes of Geralt,' added Hermanowicz.</p><p>CD Projekt Red recently shared a tech demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">The Witcher 4 at State of Unreal</a> that offered an enticing glimpse at what's coming down the line. However, CDPR later noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">the tech demo wasn't actually The Witcher 4</a>, it was just set in the world of the game.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't currently have a release date, and it's unknown if it will debut during this console generation or during the next generation.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a>, the producer of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, has hinted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version of the game could be on the way.</p>
<p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg-LRoukGVo&amp;t=12158s">livestream update</a> for MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> on Friday, the development team shared release details for the newly available Xbox version of Final Fantasy 16.</p>
<p>Yoshida then commented: "Just Nintendo left" (shared on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>). The game's creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro then replied he "will do his best".</p>

<p>Of course, this could just be a passing joke, but it certainly appears to be hinting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is considering a Switch 2 version of the latest in the mainline series.</p>
<p>Not only would this follow the Xbox version, but it would follow the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/full-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-heading-to-switch-2-director-suggests">Final Fantasy 7 Remake games also coming to Switch 2</a> - all as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a>.</p>
<p>Two questions remain, though: would Final Fantasy 16 run on Switch 2? And would it sell?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjmzmgeqFYA">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the Xbox Series X/S version of Final Fantasy 16 has issues with a softer resolution implemented in order to secure a stable frame rate. It's unclear how the lower powered Switch 2 would be able to handle the game, especially in handheld mode.</p>
<p>It's also <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-16-may-have-underperformed-on-ps5-but-its-doing-terribly-on-xbox">been reported</a> Final Fantasy 16 has not sold well on Xbox Series X/S so far, although Square Enix is yet to officially comment.</p>
<p>As such, while Square Enix's multiplatform strategy will certainly open up its games to more sales, perhaps there just isn't enough interest in Final Fantasy 16 specifically at this point, two years after its initial PS5 release. Maybe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-remake-are-finally-on-xbox-but-is-it-too-late">sales would have been stronger with a multiplatform launch</a>, though of course this still would not have factored in Switch 2.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-third-party-sales-reportedly-very-low-despite-record-breaking-console-launch">third-party games are reportedly not selling well on Switch 2</a> as Nintendo's own games - in this instance Mario Kart World - are dominating the system. We'll have to see how Final Fantasy 7 Remake sells on the system later this year to gauge how Final Fantasy 16 may fare.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ad1f1337a4f7/masahiro-sakurai-on-creating-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qPqBilhEtI">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/8d4c8cadd4d5df79bfdb3590e6447a33d9e66434">a Yahoo Japan interview</a> (geo-locked) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Smash Bros.</a> lead and game dev extraordinaire Masahiro Sakurai has blown up in the West, with reports suggesting that the Kirby creator is advocating for generative AI. However, it seems the nuance of his comments have gotten a little lost in translation.</p>
<p>Translated quotes shared on social media suggested Sakurai saw AI as a solution to the issues facing developers of large-scale games, although prominent posters such as <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1936888173327433860">Stealth</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1936935928666501290">Genki</a> have since removed initial posts as more nuanced interpretations of his interview comments have been proposed.</p><p><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>In the interview, when asked about the future of the games industry, Sakurai said he doesn't believe the current development model is sustainable due to the amount of time and work involved in producing the biggest games.</p>
<p>He followed this with comments on generative AI which were initially taken as endorsement, although as pointed out by others online, the tone is one of disappointment about the realities of AAA game dev and uncertainty about its future, not 'AI is the solution'. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">Jenny on Bluesky</a> sums it up like this:</p>
<figure><a title="jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬ Bluesky" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9aaecc75c6c63/jenny-atmiinipah-subahibi-net-bluesky.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miinipah.subahibi.net/post/3ls7ntlabrc25">jenny ‪@miinipah.subahibi.net‬</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For comparison and context around the blow-up, here's Google's stab at machine-translating the relevant section of the interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>While game development is becoming larger and more specialized and fragmented, the indie game market, which is made by one person or a small group of people, is also growing. What do you think about the future of the game market?</strong><br>
To be honest, it's impossible to tell what's going to happen in a moment. I think that if you try to make a large-scale game like the current one, it's too much work and it's not sustainable. I feel that we can't continue like this, but at the moment, the only effective solution I can think of is generative AI. I feel that we've reached a stage where we have to change the scheme, such as by using generative AI to improve work efficiency. And I think that we will enter an era where only companies that can respond well to this change will survive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it looks like another example of machine-translated text not quite capturing the nuance of the comments or the context of the conversation. Given Sakurai's extensive dev experience (which he's channelled into his enormous and excellent video series, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_en">Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games</a>), having him suddenly extolling the virtues of AI-authored content would be something of a turn.</p>
<p>It seems, however, that he was just commenting on AI as a solution being proposed by some at a time when AAA game development is more costly and time-consuming than ever.</p>
<p>Sakurai is currently working on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for Switch 2, the sequel to the GameCube racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, which is currently set to launch in '2025'.</p>

Sony hasn't provided an official map of the Death Stranding 2 release times, but with a rolling midnight launch it can get pretty confusing. To save figuring out when Death Stranding 2 launches in your area, we've got all of the release times for every region below, thanks to a countdown that appears in the Deluxe Edition version of the game upon pre-installing it.</p><p>There are two separate release dates for Death Stranding 2. The first is the early access version for those of you that purchased the Digital Deluxe or Collector's Edition of the game, and this will be released on June 24. The full release date is June 26, for everyone else. Since the early access version is advertised as 48 hours prior to the full release, this ensures that we know the release times for both versions.</p>

<p>Since PlayStation uses a rolling midnight release schedule, Death Stranding 2 will be available at midnight in the easternmost timezone of your area. For example, in the US, Death Stranding 2 will be released at midnight in New York, which is on Eastern Time. 11:00 PM in Chicago, which is on Central Time, and 9:00 PM in Los Angeles, which is on Pacific Time.</p><p>You can use similar calculations to work out when Death Stranding 2 is released in each Australian time zone--as long as you set the easternmost zone as midnight, it's easy to work out the rest.</p><h2>Death Stranding 2 early access release time</h2><p>If you purchased the Deluxe Edition or Collector's Edition of Death Stranding 2, the game will release at the following times in your area:</p><ul><li><b>ET</b> - June 24, 12:00 AM</li><li><strong>PT</strong>- June 23, 9:00 PM</li><li><strong>BST</strong> - June 24, 5:00 AM</li><li><strong>CEST</strong> - June 24, 6:00 AM</li><li><strong>IST</strong> - June 24, 9:30 AM</li><li><strong>JST</strong> - June 24, 1:00 PM</li><li><strong>AEST</strong> - June 24, 2:00 PM</li></ul><h2>Death Stranding 2 release time</h2><p>For players with the standard edition of the game, the full release times are:</p><ul><li><b>ET</b> - June 26, 12:00 AM</li><li><strong>PT</strong>- June 25, 9:00 PM</li><li><strong>BST</strong> - June 26, 5:00 AM</li><li><strong>CEST</strong> - June 26, 6:00 AM</li><li><strong>IST</strong> - June 26, 9:30 AM</li><li><strong>JST</strong> - June 26, 1:00 PM</li><li><strong>AEST</strong> - June 26, 2:00 PM</li></ul><p>While it's not long before you can get your hands on the game, director Hideo Kojima said that Death Stranding 2 was his "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-was-kojimas-most-difficult-challenge-and-was-nearly-canceled/1100-6532495/" data-ref-id="1100-6532495">most difficult challenge</a>" and was almost canceled.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re a returning fan of the series, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4 might make you question the nature of time and mortality. The demo for this remade duology – currently available to those that pre-order the game on PS5, Xbox Series consoles and PC – opens with a collection of live footage from the included skaters, that roster including Riley Hawk, Tony Hawk’s adult son, 15 year-old Chloe Cavell, and Olympic star Rayssa Leal, who was born in 2008. For all that this is a remake and remaster of two games from 2001 and 2002, time has definitely passed for Tony Hawk and the skateboarding scene.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tony Hawk's™ Pro Skater™ 3 + 4 | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eYmlS8zwb5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What it does show is that the skateboarding scene is not just alive and well, it’s kickflipping its way into a whole new generation’s hearts. The easy ability to share clips worldwide, the sport reaching all the way to the Olympics, and the resurgence of games like Skate and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater speaks to a sport that’s in rude health. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is only going to cement that further.</p>


<p>The demo gives you two skaters, Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, though there is a third available if you’ve preordered the Deluxe Edition of the game. That third option is the Slayer from Doom, and maybe it’s just me, but does the Doom guy really seem like the most obvious choice for hitting a wicked Manual and bouncing into a cool kickflip? Weirder tie-ins exist, for sure, but I don’t think it’s the biggest draw for a Deluxe Edition, which also gives you a horrific alien Revenant skater too. If Doom is your favourite franchise, then maybe you’re spending the extra. At least Bam Margera is lurking around the final release.</p>
<p>The demo has two areas, Foundry and College, and it’s little surprise to find that these levels look absolutely stunning on current-gen hardware. Running in 4K, 60fps on PlayStation 5, Foundry has molten metal and jets of steam spilling out into the arena, as well as a focused set of rails, ramps and half-pipes, with the build feeling quite claustrophobic, forcing you to make split-second decisions to keep your combo going.</p>


<p>It’s definitely a more intense option compared to the sprawling College level. Here, those two minutes you’re given feel utterly lacking, as the number of options, hard-to-reach sections and potential routes spiral into the hundreds, if not thousands. It looks stunning, and I loved re-learning the techniques that fans of the series will have embedded in the back of their brain. Rightly or wrongly, grinds and manuals feel more natural now, flowing together more readily than they did when I was younger, but perhaps that’s just the result of familiarity and practice that have been years in the making.</p>
<p>Even in the demo you can dig into your skater’s setup swapping out or adding additional special moves, changing the inputs for these, or altering a few of the cosmetic options, like the board designs. You do earn money through each run, and while there’s no options here to spend it, I’m sure you’ll be buying your favourite skater’s different looks in the full release.</p>
<p>That will undoubtedly play into the upcoming Create-A-Skater mode, so you’ll be able to put yourself (or at least a version of yourself that can ride a skateboard without falling off) into the game. That sits handily alongside the Create-A-Park mode, which lets you create your own park from the ground up. I’m expecting this to run better than ever too, with the current gen horsepower behind them.</p>

<p>Tony Hawk’s would be nothing without the right soundtrack, and the demo gives you the requisite mix of bands like CKY and Motorhead nuzzling up to Lupe Fiasco for a great mix of vibes while you attempt to land that 900. It’s a real shame to find that some songs from the original games have been cut – an announcement from Alien Ant Farm dropped this week saying they were out – but we won’t know the full track list until we have the final game in our hands. You can remove any songs from the rotation if you don’t like them, and there’s some original tracks from Logan Byers that you can add in as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nicest surprise about THPS3+4 is that Activision have opted for a mid-range pricepoint of £39.99, which feels like a great price to jump in at, particularly on Switch 2 during its release window. For those on Xbox, it’s also going to be there day one on Game Pass, giving you no reason not to check it out.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk’s has never felt smoother, or looked better, and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 looks like the perfect way to blend the old-school and the new-school together when it releases for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series consoles, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenia-canary-development-team-is-not-working-with-microsoft-on-the-xbox-classics-program.1225476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xenia Canary development team is not working with Microsoft on the rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-classics-emulator-enhancements/">Xbox Classics program</a>, the team itself confirmed in a new statement shared online.</p>
<p>As reported on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lhsg0m/xenia_team_post_official_response_about_rumoured/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, the development team of the Xbox 360 emulator confirmed on their official Discord server that they are not associated with Microsoft by any means, nor are they working with the company in any capacity. Microsoft uses its own emulation to deliver backward compatibility on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, the team added, and, as such, has no reason to collaborate with Xenia if they ever decide to bring their games to PC.</p>
<p>Though one may argue the Xenia Canary team could never confirm they are working on the Xbox Classics program under an NDA, if the team actually signed such an agreement, they would keep their silence on the matter, so at this point, there's no reason not to believe the developer's official statement. This doesn't mean that Microsoft isn't working on bringing classic Xbox games to PC and current consoles, but it also makes the rumor less credible, although the original leaker has doubled down on the matter, saying that such a program is indeed in the works and will be revealed next year to coincide with Xbox's 25th anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Nintendo Racers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7725d4c79231/mario-kart-world-nintendo-racers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's no denying that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> packs a pretty impressive roster of racers (come on, 50 characters, <em>plus</em> costumes ain't bad), but we'd be foolish if we didn't pour one out for the familiar faces that were lost along the way. We're talking, of course, about the <del>Koopalings</del> wider Nintendo characters that got cosy in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, but missed out on the starting line this time around.</p>
<p>Link, Isabelle, the Villagers and the Inklings no longer grace the character select screen in World, and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/gaming/super-mario/mario-kart/exclusif-mario-kart-world-le-producteur-kosuke-yabuki-devoile-les-secrets-de-sa-creation-0650c104-3ba2-11f0-88b0-943c4d024772">Ouest-France</a>, producer Kosuke Yabuki explained why (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/mario-kart-world-nintendo-characters/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>According to Yabuki-san, the Mario Kart World development team felt the line-up was already beefy enough, <em>without</em> Link and co. in tow. "As developers, it would have seemed incongruous to us to add characters from other games into this universe," he told the French outlet (via Google Translate), "And it didn't seem necessary to us, given everything we could already do with Mario".</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/this-is-it-nintendo-on-why-it-added-cow-into-mario-kart-world">Ask the Developer interview</a> gave us some insight into how excited the developers were to add the likes of Cow to the game, so it makes sense that the team would want to keep going with as many Mario regulars as possible. We'd be on that character select screen all day if they started adding lil guys from <em>every</em> Nintendo franchise, after all.</p>
<p>And, let's admit it, we've all gone crazy for some of these newbies, regardless of where they came from. "The reception has been so warm that it surprised even us," Yabuki-san told Ouest-France, "It definitely exceeded our expectations".</p>
<p>"We inevitably wonder how players will perceive this casting," Yabuki-san concluded, "But there are so many characters and so many costumes that every player is sure to find something to suit them".</p>
<p>Part of us assumed that Mario Kart would balloon into some sort of Smash-style 'Nintendo Kart' for the next entry, so it's actually pretty refreshing to see the Big N go in the opposite direction. And besides, who's choosing Link over Monty Mole?</p>

Enter the game's latest mission - kick off the Super Earth rebuild by securing "reparations".</p>
<p>How are those funds being secured, you ask? This is Helldivers 2, so it's by killing a bunch more baddies.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The monumental effort to rebuild Super Earth is underway," confirms <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1934972239130107927">the order's briefing</a> from devs Arrowhead, "A full damage assessment has concluded, exhaustively detailing the incalculable wounds inflicted upon our sovereign homeworld — and their monetary cost, adjusted for inflation."</p>
<p>In order to pay those bills, players have been ordered to secure reparations by enacting some "compulsory asset forfeiture". Basically, they've got to kill 290 million Illuminate enemies and 2.9 billion bugs in just under a week.</p>
<p>Now, these sorts of 'kill a big number of things' orders have often been the most stark showcases of HD2 players' terrifying abilities when it comes to getting stuff done over the past year and a bit. Since they end as soon as the targets are reached, a number of them - especially those that target the squishable Terminid swarms - have ended early.</p> <div>

<p>This time, though, the sheer size of the bug kill total does look to be presenting a tough challenge thus far. As of writing, the game's <a href="https://helldiverscompanion.com/#overview">unofficial Galactic War tracking apps</a> say 223,303,766 Terminids have been terminated, putting the divers on track to overshoot the deadline of three days or so they've got. On the other hand, things are going great with the Illuminate, with players 41.3% of the way to their goal and looking set to hit it tomorrow.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lho812/new_major_order/">Reddit</a>, there might be a bit of fatigue regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-leans-hard-into-alien-vibes-as-players-fight-to-take-back-freaky-illuminatified-cites">Illuminate major orders</a> setting in at the moment, with some players wishing they'd been sent after the Automatons instead for this mission.</p>
<p>Outside of that live-service grind psychological insight, the interesting thing about this latest mission to me is that, assuming Super Earth does eventually get rebuilt, one would assume another battle for it might be in the cards down the line. It'll probably be a ways away, but I'd be intrigued to see how Arrowhead would go about trying to outdo the first big battle for the planet.</p>
<p>I'd think it'd maybe have to involve a new faction folks have spent less time fighting than the three in the game right now, and some sort of twist on the sequence of fights to hold different mega cities that we got first time around.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'll stop speculating before I get to the point oftrying to guess what the second battle for Super Earth's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">commemorative cape</a> might look like.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-post-death-and-destruction-super-earth-rebuild-begins-financed-by-more-death-and-destruction]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Marvel Snap, the digital collectible card game that's been live for nearly three years, has been accused of stealing art from the Japanese tokusatsu drama Kamen Rider Wizard. More specifically, users <a href="https://x.com/Tewakuumea/status/1933090847089979699" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> that the art used for the Ancient One's magic shield is nearly identical, as you can see in the comparison below.</p>


<p>The original designer of Kamen Rider Wizard, which aired a total of 53 episodes between September 2012 and 2013, didn't take it very well. On their X account, they <a href="https://x.com/tajimax1968/status/1933479652292734983" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>Oh my. I don't know this game, but this may be a huge rip-off. By the way, the dragon in the center is a PLEX design, and the outer circle surrounding it is all my own. The text is designed by my junior colleague and means a spell to gain power from magic stones. The text was written by K-kun from our literary team. Needless to say, everything is undoubtedly original.</em></p>
<p><em>As a designer, I find it distasteful. Above all, it is extremely disrespectful to fans of both characters. It ignores the original and is distributed and used as if it were originally this character's, which makes me feel angry and sad. Especially since I love MARVEL so much.</em></p>
<p>Griffin, the Community Manager of Marvel Snap, replied on the game's official Discord channel that the report is being 'investigated'. That was a while ago, however.</p>

<p>Marvel Snap <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-is-down-in-the-us-following-tiktok-ban-but-devs-are-working-to-restore-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> to the forefront of gaming news earlier this year due to the temporary TikTok ban enforced in the United States. At the time, the game was still published by Nuverse, which is owned by ByteDance, the same company behind TikTok.</p>
<p>The ban only lasted a couple of days, but later in January 2025, Marvel Snap developer Second Dinner announced the decision to switch to Skystone Games, a US-based publisher.</p>

<p>Additionally, Round8 developers all got Nintendo Switch 2 consoles. We don't usually report on sales figures at RPS, but reading this made me picture an exhausted combat designer grinning and sipping margaritas in the sun while playing Mario Kart for a fortnight, which I consider an image worth sharing.</p>
<p>To spoon Marmite in the margarita somewhat, this obviously also stood out since stories like this can feel like the exception in a landscape where the reward for working on a successful game can just as often be unemployment, as was the case with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">US-based Marvel Rivals dev back in February</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's at least a few devs at Round8 that would have preferred the money over a console - giving out free Switch 2's feels somewhat like a conscious attempt to generate goodfeels press and pizza-party loyalty. Still, Kudos to Neowiz for being chill cool nice good dudes about it: your reward is one goodfeels press. Lies Of P's Overture DLC got a surprise release earlier this month at Medium Geoff's Bad Shoe Jamboree, which turned out to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-not-alone-in-thinking-lies-of-p-overture-is-a-bit-tough-but-an-update-is-coming-to-smooth-things-over">be surprisingly difficult</a> at that.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-free-nintendo-switch-2-two-weeks-paid-holiday-and-a-pile-of-money-for-lies-of-p-devs-after-hitting-sales-milestones]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While the paid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">Switch 2 Editions grabbed all the headlines</a> for all the wrong reasons in the run-up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2’s</a> release, it’s fair to say that Nintendo has actually been far more generous through the rest of its game line-up. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/">Free patches for a bunch of games arrived at launch</a> to add key new features and more native Switch 2 support with improved performance across a bunch of first-party games, both big and small, new and old.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch 2 Patched Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yyubQ4j5Ngg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start at the top of the alphabet with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>. This spring-loaded fighting game was a fun diversion that arrived in the early days of the original Switch, and since it already performed very nicely on the console, it’s far from the most obvious candidate for a Switch 2 patch.</p>


<p>And yet here it is, and it’s marvellous. Nintendo has bumped up the native resolution to allow for much higher graphical detail to be revealed –&nbsp;you can really see the weave on Min Min’s beanie, for example, and the background audience is so much sharper and well defined –&nbsp;there’s a bit of support for HDR to let colours pop better on modern TV screens and the built-in display… but there’s also one unexpected improvement.</p>
<div id="attachment_461119"><p id="caption-attachment-461119">ARMS now runs at 60fps in 4 player split-screen!</p>
</div>
<p>The single-player game already ran at 60fps on Switch 1, but dropped to 30fps for four-player split-screen –&nbsp;it pulls a trick of updating the left side and right side pairing alternately. Now? Switch 2 has four-player split-screen at a lovely 60fps. It’s sublime. When online is going to rarely have players, local multiplayer is where this game will be at its best now.</p>
<p>Another game with a lovely bump to the resolution and frame rates is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3</a>. Now all areas of the game are running at 60fps, and while battles were already 60fps on Switch 1, that now means that the city plaza hub area has been bumped up from a 30fps limit to 60fps, giving the whole game that same slick smoothness. There’s also been a pretty hefty resolution bump which seems to be to a native 4K during battles, while the plaza does sacrifice some resolution to get its 60fps. Considering that Nintendo has a historical aversion to anti-aliasing, which has continued through to these patches, it’s a major improvement in clarity that does just look great.</p>
<div id="attachment_461120"><p id="caption-attachment-461120">Splatoon 3’s plaza now runs at 60fps on Switch 2 and resolutions have been greatly increased.</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/09/new-super-mario-bros-u-deluxe-review/">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</a> is an example that’s just… well, it’s fine. The game has optimised visuals, and there is a jump in resolution, but given the art style, the difference feels minimal. The game was originally a Wii U title, and alongside Captain Toad and Mario 3D World (two games we’ve not tested), Nintendo’s restraint for the original platform already meant that these games look, run and play incredibly well in their original Switch ports. I don’t have Bowser’s Fury, but I understand that this had some performance issues on Switch that Switch 2 has resolved.</p>
<div id="attachment_461121"><p id="caption-attachment-461121">NSMBU on Switch 2 is higher res, but the difference feels minimal.</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is another game that already looked pretty fantastic and Nintendo again did a marvellous job optimising the title to perform consistently well. Yet, there were some Kingdoms that really pushed the console rather hard. New Donk City is an obvious example that really suffered from a lowered resolution, dropping from the 900p docked target to 720p to handle this and maintain the all-important 60fps. With no anti-aliasing it made for a really very shimmery image when running around. The Switch 2 update makes this just so much clearer pushing up to around 1700p in New Donk City, around 5x the number of pixels, and capable of higher in less taxing kingdoms and areas. There is still some aliasing shimmer when getting around quickly, but it feels so much better and clearer.</p>
<div id="attachment_461122"><p id="caption-attachment-461122">Switch 2 can power Mario Odyssey’s New Donk City to much higher resolutions.</p></div>
<p>The two chibi-like Zelda games for Switch – that’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a> and Echoes of Wisdom – have also been patched. Though unfortunately we see some mixed results. The game resolution has been bumped up massively, which is lovely, but in docked play, the push for 4K gives Ukuku Prarie, Mabe Village, the beach a drop away from that 60fps target. We’re not sure what’s going on here, because we then compared the swamp area that troubled the Switch 1, and this is now just 60fps on Switch 2. It is… strange, and I double checked to be sure. Thankfully, this seems to disappear when playing in handheld, as the maximum resolution comes down to 1080p.</p>
<div id="attachment_461123"><p id="caption-attachment-461123">Link’s Awakening seems less capable of holding 60fps on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>By contrast, a little route we ran in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">Echoes of Wisdom</a> showed great improvement. We could easily drop the frame rate to a V-Sync 30fps through setting lots of fires, summoning lots of creatures, and the like, and this has just been stamped out with a close to locked 60fps.</p>
<div id="attachment_461124"><p id="caption-attachment-461124">Echoes of Wisdom is a clear win on Switch 2.</p></div>
<p>Across a bunch of games where there was co-op previously, there’s now support for GameShare, which streams the game to local and online co-op buddies, and can pull some fantastic tricks to give independent views in games that need it. It works really quite well, though the streams can be a bit compressed and poor WiFi can be an impediment. We tried it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/01/51-worldwide-games-clubhouse-review/">51 Worldwide Games</a>, but there’s also Big Brain Academy, through to Mario Odyssey, Mario 3D World and Captain Toad. It’s great to see it added, but some of these games also show the restricted access that GameShare is given, being limited to certain games and modes instead of being more freeform like Sony and Valve’s equivalents.</p>
<p>But then we come to the game that is most thoroughly transformed by the Switch 2 patch: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>. This game remains in a quite shockingly poor state on original Switch, a real indictment for the work by Game Freak on the series of late, with mediocre visual targets, poor resolutions and strange compromises, all combined with seriously poor performance that’s not befitting of even the underpowered original Switch hardware.</p>

<p>Switch 2 just blasts through all of that, delivering a quite gorgeous looking game that runs at 60fps instead of a poorly paced 30fps…. at best on Switch 1. It looks very clean and crisp on Switch 2, but also seems to be using DLSS upscaling from 1080p when docked to reach that goal – you can see the true resolution after a camera cut, before the temporal anti-aliasing can use that to spruce up following frames. There’s further improvements, so background elements that were at cut frame rates now run smoothly at much greater distances, there’s more Pokémon out and about, and this is generally a huge improvement…. but it’s still well below what the such a huge franchise as Pokémon deserves, there’s still a lot of pop-in, and the base level of the graphics should be much better. Hopefully <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> takes a step forward.</p>
<p>We looked at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">general backward compatibility last week</a>, and saw some great improvements to steady frame rates and lift dynamic resolutions, but with a dedicated patch, games can clearly go an awful lot further. Honestly, the only games that Nintendo updated that really <em>needed</em> an update for performance here were Pokémon Scarlet and Violet and perhaps Echoes of Wisdom and Link’s Awakening, but Nintendo has shown great value in patching other games from their back catalogue, even ports from the Wii U, boosting resolutions, frame rates in specific modes, and of course, adding GameShare support. It’s great to have these patches across the board, and hope to see many more examples of this, where possible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In March 2021, Bellevue-based game development studio Hidden Path Entertainment (known mainly for Defense Grid and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive) <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-aaa-open-world-rpg-coming-from-hidden-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was working on a third-person open world AAA RPG based on the D&amp;D license. At the time, the developer was still recruiting for key roles, such as Graphics Programmer, Lead Graphics Programmer, Senior Technical Artist, and Writer.</p>
<p>It was an exciting project, as we had never had a true open world D&amp;D RPG. Unfortunately, the game never materialized. In January 2023, Dungeons and Dragons license holder Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-cancels-at-least-5-games-including-2-dd-titles-from-hidden-path-otherside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> several games, including a game in development at Otherside and Hidden Path's open world title. Intriguingly, at that time, Hidden Path denied that the project was already dead as they tried to find other funding sources.&nbsp;However, it ultimately had to resign itself in February 2024, when the studio also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-open-world-rpg-from-hidden-path-is-officially-halted-as-developer-lays-off-44-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> 44 employees.</p>
<p>Although we may never play the game ourselves, we can now at least take a look at it. MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the portfolio of a former employee, which included several details and even some gameplay footage of a mission, which you can find embedded below.</p>

<p>The D&amp;D open world RPG was codenamed Project Dante. The gameplay seemed very similar to a regular third-person action RPG, with stealth mechanics on display as well. The player character was accompanied by two companions, as befitting a Dungeons &amp; Dragons title.</p>
<p>There's also an IMGUR gallery featuring concept art for the canceled game. You can browse it below.</p>
<blockquote lang="en" data-id="a/ZCdr9WI"><p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI">View post on imgur.com</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Despite this cancellation, D&amp;D gaming fans have plenty of other projects to look forward to:</p>

            <p>"Experts urge UK households follow tips to beat heatwave, Dread Spider Tide" screech the inter-tabloids. Sparkling pig-grade hogwash, I say. I've recently discovered that the only things you need to defeat the sun are a cheap space heater set to fan mode and a PC overworked to boiling point, the combination of which creates some sort of mysteriously blissful temperature vacuum. Also, I refuse to open my curtains. For those also working on their attractive monitor-glow sallow tan, here are this week's new PC game releases.</p>
<h2>Monday 23rd June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Today sees the release of  real estate roguelike and Balatro for landlords (Bastardlatro? Fix your own latrino?) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3546440/Rentlord/">Rentlord</a>. "Maximize rent, while avoiding taxes!", it urges. I'm reverting to default leftist fist shaking here but the one landlord I've ever had was actually a really nice bloke who once took it upon himself to unblock a sink I'd clogged up with rice. Also, he reminded me strongly of Ian Holm's Bilbo Baggins. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710910/Warhammer_40000_Darktide__Arbites_Class/">Darktide's Arbites</a> class is also out. Ah, Games Workshop. The company who only take time off from plagiarising Judge Dredd (and Dune, and Moorcock) to sue individual Etsy users for selling dice with ork faces on them.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 24th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Tuesday brings tactical RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Shuffle Tactics</a>, which features both nicely minimal pixel sprites and very good fantasy mammals. It's got deckbuilding too, listing both Final Fantasy Tactics and Slay The Spire as inspirations. There's also more Warty Thou in the form of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622820/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader__Lex_Imperialis/">Lex Imperialis</a> story expansion for Owlcat's Rogue Trader. It's also got Arbites in it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1498060/Nanomon_Virtual_Pet/">Nanomon Virtual Pet</a> looks cute, if you're bored of all the grimdark cyberdogs.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 25th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Free walking sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3739210/Condo/">Condo</a> is about exploring an apartment complex in a bout of insomnia and meeting its inhabitants. It's got a slightly noirish, slightly windowless whiskey bar from Yakuza vibe I'm fond of. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3597590/Dungeon_Mori/">Dungeon Mori</a> is a fetching crawler, although perhaps not fetching enough to overcome my inherent racism against fantasy catgirls.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 26th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/">Nightdive's System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> headlines Thursday. That's the great uncle of immersive sims and Kenny Lemsip's precursor to Bioshock. Immersive sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2941710/Project_Silverfish/">Project Silverfish</a> releases in early access. More importantly, there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3808460/Bird_Game/">Bird Game</a>. If you dislike birds and/or games, you can "explore a museum containing the word's greatest collection of toilet art" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3781500/La_Galerie_des_Toilettes/">La Galerie des Toilettes</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 27th June</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Friday has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1861250/Antro/">Antro</a> inside of it - a rhythmic 2.5d platformer from Barcelona where you're a courier who's also out to overthrow a totalitarian regime. There's also "Untitled Shoes Game" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3274390/Bambas/">Bambas</a>. Good one, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bambas-is-untitled-shoes-game">Edwin</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This week the Treehouse is mostly melting. Not me though. I am a very good temperature. Let me know if I've missed any good'uns.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-system-shock-2-remastered-multiple-warhammer-40000-dogs-and-an-unexpected-continuation-of-toilet-theming]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Can you uncover the truth hidden deep within the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em>?</p><p><strong>Single Play: An Extreme <a title="Genres > Stealth [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> Challenge</strong></p><p><em>UNDERWARD</em> is also playable single play, but be warned—single play is an ultra-high-difficulty mode where getting caught means instant game over. The game includes many trial-and-error challenges, so in solo play, you’ll need to learn through death and keep progressing.</p><p>(Version 1.0.2.0 introduced extra lives and solo play adjustments for a better experience.)</p><p>Without the ability to perform chained carries, you’ll have to carefully transport your cargo while constantly fearing an enemy ambush, making for an intensely thrilling experience. You’ll need to avoid detection, watch out for traps, and proceed with extra caution. While the gameplay differs significantly from <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [530 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, this mode is perfect for players seeking a truly spine-chilling horror experience.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>Explore the depths of <em>UNDERWARD</em> and carry the “TEST-SUBJECT” monsters to the elevator.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search “Test Subjects”</strong></p><p>Once you exit the elevator, scour the floor for “TEST-SUBJECT.”</p><p>But beware—traps and dangers are lurking everywhere. Some areas and mechanisms can only be accessed by cooperating with your teammates. It’s best to avoid venturing alone if possible.</p><p>You might also find useful tools left behind in the area. Be sure to check out lockers, shelves, and any other hiding spots for gear. With luck, you may even find some highly advanced equipment.</p><p><strong>Step 2: If They See You, Run or…</strong></p><p>There’s a chance you will encounter unknown enemies during your search.</p><p>They’re attracted to noise, so stay cautious. If you hide quietly, they might pass without noticing you. Adapt to the situation as needed.</p><p>But if you get spotted, run as fast as you can! Throw items you have at them—it might just help you fend them off.</p><p>Even if someone gets taken down, there’s still hope for rescue.</p><p>Your teammate’s location will be displayed on the screen, so act quickly and stay calm. Minimizing casualties will strengthen the team bond.</p><p>But remember: the window for rescue is shrinking by the second.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Carry and Carry and Carry!</strong></p><p>Once you’ve found “TEST-SUBJECT,” carry it to the elevator with all your might.</p><p>Carrying the capsule creates a lot of noise, attracting enemies, so stay vigilant.</p><p>Although a single investigator can’t handle the heavy capsule alone, you can perform a “Connected Carry” system with multiple players to move it faster than the enemies can catch up.</p><p>However, if your teamwork falters, it could mean a one-way ticket to the afterlife.</p><p>Each “TEST-SUBJECT” has a different value.</p><p>We hope the team can retrieve the most valuable “TEST-SUBJECT” possible.</p><p><strong>Then… Deeper into the “UNDERWARD”</strong></p><p>Once you’ve met the recovery quota, proceed with the verification of the “TEST-SUBJECTS.” We will operate the elevator to the next floor, so investigators should close the elevator door and wait inside.</p><p>We take great pride in the investigators who choose to venture deeper into the more dangerous floors.</p><p>…Please note that we do not guarantee the safety of your life on this mission.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>One-to-four-player cooperative horror exploration game.</li><li>Proximity-based voice chat.</li><li>Randomized, labyrinthine underground hospital floors (with some areas that don’t feel like a hospital at all).</li><li>Deadly and seductive nurse monsters that hunt you.</li><li>Vicious hunters that can be unleashed over time.</li><li>Retrieve capsules containing “TEST-SUBJECT.”</li><li>Supply Machine System: Exchange retrieval rewards for randomized items.</li><li>“Connected Carry” system for high-speed carry with multiple players.</li><li>Various useful items that can be carried over to the next floor.</li><li>Total wipeout = all is lost.
