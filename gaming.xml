            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hori has announced another addition to the ever-growing list of cheaper alternatives to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Nintendo’s $90 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>. The Wireless Horipad Turbo is around $35 cheaper than Nintendo’s, and while it lacks a lot of premium features such as Amiibo support and the ability to remotely wake the Switch 2, it adds a lock button on the back that disables the buttons in the middle of the controller. That includes the Home and Screenshot shortcuts so they won’t do anything if accidentally pressed in the middle of a game.</p><p>The Wireless Horipad Turbo is currently <a href="https://horistore.com/shop/g/gnsx-126/">available for preorder in Japan through Hori’s online store</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0FRM1SR6Z?th=1">Amazon Japan</a> for 7,980 yen, or about $54, in mist black, aquasian, shine yellow, frost white, and ruby magenta color options. It’s expected to launch before the year is out. There are no details on when or if it may see a US release, or if pricing will be comparable if it does, but it will be compatible with all versions of the Switch.</p><p>Aside from the use of translucent housing, the Horipad Turbo looks very similar to Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro Controller, including the game chat button located between the D-pad and right analog joystick. Hori has opted for drift-resistant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance</a> (TMR) joysticks instead of Hall effect or capacitive options, which alone could make it more appealing than Nintendo’s gamepad. But the company has also skipped other features, including a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>You will find an extra set of buttons on the back of the Horipad Turbo, and the company has gone the extra mile by allowing you to remap the functionality of the action, shoulder, and trigger buttons, as well as the D-pad and joysticks. You can even reprogram a single button to replicate the functionality of two others simultaneously, and you can activate rapidfire using an additional button on the front of the gamepad featuring the red, white, and blue Hori logo.</p><p>The lock button on the back of the Horipad Turbo can be toggled between disabling the Hori, Home, and Screenshot buttons. There’s also an option that locks the plus and minus buttons, ensuring you won’t pop into a menu screen at an inopportune time with an accidental press.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/791438/hori-wireless-horipad-turbo-nintendo-switch-2-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-internet-reacts-to-taylor-swift%E2%80%99s-new-album.1316077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every time Taylor Swift, the country star turned pop royalty, releases a new album, it’s a cultural event, whether you’re a Swiftie or not. This is because the algorithm will no doubt feed you reactions and commentary just because you are, at most, one degree removed from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a> <span>star’s fandom at all times. </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is Swift’s 12th album, and turns the dial back into radio/TikTok-ready pop after </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department </span></i><span>went for a more melancholic, folky sound. But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift’s work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life. As that personal life has become so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>well-known in and out of her music</span></a><span>, it’s usually pretty obvious who a song is about. So there’s some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fiancé Travis Kelce’s hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. “Wood” starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n’ Sweet </span></i><span>singer’s trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let’s look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and openеd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lovе was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce’s </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn’t enough to make it clear that this is about her man’s schlong, the reference to a “hard rock” like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There’s an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can’t tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they’re about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she’s the only one he’s really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there’s a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn’t love to sing about a man’s dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift’s very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can’t hear this song without knowing whose dick it’s about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter’s clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is “Actually Romantic,” which takes the other side of “everyone knowing your business” and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don’t know, Charli has a song called “Sympathy Is a Knife” on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. “Actually Romantic” is being called a diss track aimed at the “360” singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind “Sympathy Is a Knife,” which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, “Actually Romantic” does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift’s past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli’s husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it’s actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you’ve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there’s more happening than “Sympathy Is a Knife” lets on. It’s giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>’s “Bad Blood” which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it’s the effect of someone’s personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that’s already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from “Sympathy Is a Knife,” then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift’s status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the “relatable” persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. “Eldest Daughter” laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she’s enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>— grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is “CANCELLED!” which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can’t stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends “cancelled” and cloaked in “scandal.” Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people’s criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift’s discography. I don’t think I’m alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself. For better or worse.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/fEAu5T8XnL">pic.twitter.com/fEAu5T8XnL</a></p> <p>— emily (@grIgenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/grIgenius/status/1973971796795011134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">every year a taylor swift album comes out and she goes roses are red grass is green i love travis and my haters are mean and her fans go Omgggggg the lyricism</p> <p>— zade (@zadtwt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zadtwt/status/1973855618890158350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">she did it omg <a href="https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG">https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG</a> <a href="https://t.co/idYwgDuRH0">pic.twitter.com/idYwgDuRH0</a></p> <p>— Wendell (@RhodeToLove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RhodeToLove/status/1973970282617667816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yall im CRYINGNSIDNDHF <a href="https://t.co/nC25tp2KcZ">pic.twitter.com/nC25tp2KcZ</a></p> <p>— allypally (@allypallyxcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/allypallyxcx/status/1974027869689983175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy">https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy</a> <a href="https://t.co/NAQvUVy9Qp">pic.twitter.com/NAQvUVy9Qp</a></p> <p>— The Coke That Made Charli xcx Brave (@Neil_McNeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_McNeil/status/1974002104575328501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/O23bECsSMr">https://t.co/O23bECsSMr</a> <a href="https://t.co/iK8u3dO19T">pic.twitter.com/iK8u3dO19T</a></p> <p>— keira (@kettlevinyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/kettlevinyl/status/1973991187330576725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">These aren’t lyrics born of depth, just reference points engineered to ride the current wave internet talking points like ‘eldest daughters suffer more than jesus’ and spark a shallow ‘she’s just like me’ emotion from its listener.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Masters of Albion Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Masters of Albion is in the works by Molyneux's independent studio, 22cans, which he founded in 2012 after leaving Lionhead Studios. The game, which has players managing a medieval village, currently lacks a release window.</p><p>Molyneux, most famous for designing the god game Black &amp; White and the first three Fable games, is perhaps equally as famous for his pre-release hyperbolic and over-enthusiastic descriptions of his games, often leading to disappointment when they fall short of expectations or lack promised features.</p><p>To his credit, Molyneux is aware of his tendency to exaggerate, telling Edge: "I know people are going to say, 'Come on, it won't be your last game,' but, you know, I'm 66 years old." The veteran developer, who once <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-doesn-t-plan-to-retire-i-m-just-gonna-die/1100-6418258/" data-ref-id="1100-6418258">said in 2014 that he's "just gonna die"</a> instead of retiring, added: "I'm working as hard as I've ever worked in my life. And I just haven't got the life energy left to do this again."</p><p>Even after the public reveal of Masters of Albion, Molyneux expressed the possibility that this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-could-be-his-last-game-due-to-his-smoking-drinking/1100-6526010/" data-ref-id="1100-6526010">next game could be his last</a>, speaking candidly (and rather morbidly) about his lifestyle, which includes smoking and drinking.</p><p>"I started to ask… what should I focus on? I was 60 at the time and this realization came to me that this next game could be my last," Molyneux said in 2024. "I am not announcing I'm retiring. I'll be found dead one morning with my head pressed against the keyboard."</p>

			<p>Skate is out in its early access form, and developer Full Circle and EA are preparing to launch the game's first major content update with the release of Season 1 coming next week on October 7, 2025. A new trailer shows off several of what's to come, like new skate-able areas, new cosmetics for players to earn, the introduction of the Skate Pass, and seasonal events, while <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/skate-season-1">a blog post on the Skate website</a> goes into more detail on everything.</p>



<p>The Skate Pass will introduce daily, weekly, and seasonal tasks that give you various bonuses for completing them, seasonal challenges, and if you purchase the premium version, daily grants for players.</p>



<p>Also included in the Season 1 update will be seasonal events like Skate-O-Ween, the Halloween-themed event Skate will host this month. As EA and Full Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/skate-early-access-roadmap-ea-full-circle/">previously announced, all of these additions (new areas, cosmetics, seasonal events, etc.)</a> are what you can expect to see in every new season of Skate.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Full Circle and EA's new iteration on the once-beloved skateboarding series has been met with mixed results, to say the least. On the one hand, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/skate-leads-augusts-top-games-by?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=175193486&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">Alinea Analytics reports that the game is reaching staggeringly high player numbers</a>, and was one of September's leading games in terms of revenue earned.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the game has been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review">critically panned by some</a> and heavily criticized online for being a live-service, microtransaction-forward re-shaping of the series.</p>



<p>Regardless, player numbers and revenue intake all point to this new Skate game having a strong start. The question, of course, is whether it can keep this momentum up, or if the game will drop off and out of the spotlight even before it can exit early access.</p>

              <p>Spooky season is upon us, and that means the movie theater schedules are stacked with horror movies. This year, more than ever, bigger names are being drawn to the genre as it proves one of the most resilient ways of getting butts in seats. With Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Frankenstein</em> leading the pack, we’ve also got Ethan Hawke returning for&nbsp;<em>Black Phone 2</em>, Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>, and both Justin Long and Kate Bosworth appearing in&nbsp;<em>Coyotes</em>. And so many more besides. So, to be helpful, we’ve rounded up the trailers for all of October’s scariest upcoming horror movies.</p> <p>Horror is big business right now, with studios having finally noticed that if you put more than no money into a scary film, you can still make them super-cheap and see some stellar returns. As such, we’re seeing some bigger names wanting to get involved, alongside the gloriously kitsch and classically gory. Below, in order of U.S. release date across October, are our picks for flicks to scare you out of you knicks.</p> <h2><em>Good Boy</em></h2>  <p>Out today (<strong>October 3</strong>) and getting rave reviews (including <a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497">this praise from <em>Kotaku</em>‘s own Kenneth Shepard</a>),&nbsp;<em>Good Boy</em> is a horror movie from the perspective of a dog. Indy the doggo is determined to protect his human buddy Todd from evil forces in a surprisingly short film—just 72 minutes. It’s written and directed by Ben Leonberg, his first feature-length movie, and stars his own pet dog Indy—a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever—in the lead role. The human cast are relative unknowns (although perhaps not for long) Arielle Friedman and Shane Jensen, alongside Hollywood stalwart portrayer of homeless gentlemen, Stuart Rudin.</p> <h2><em>Bone Lake</em></h2>  <p>Has there been a more on-the-nose name for a horror movie since 1999’s ridiculous&nbsp;<em>Cherry Falls</em>?&nbsp;<em>Bone Lake</em> is a sexy horror flick from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, previously best known for, er,&nbsp;<em>Stargate Origins: Catherine</em>. The Bleecker Street release is clearly attempting to evoke a little bit of&nbsp;<em>Saltburn</em>, but in a story about two couples accidentally booking the same AirBnB for the same weekend. Except, for some reason, everyone keeps taking their clothes off and/or being chopped up by axes and chainsaws. I mean, it sounds like all the elements for a stone-cold B-movie classic. The first handful of reviews have been middling, but then this was never a movie to win over the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. It too is out today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Coyotes</em></h2>  <p>Yet another <strong>October 3</strong> release is comedy horror film <em>Coyotes</em>. Real-life couple Kate Bosworth <em>(Superman</em> <em>Returns</em>, <em>Before I Wake</em>) and Justin Long (<em>Weapons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest</em>) reunite after appearing together in 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>, as parents trapped in their home by a savage pack of…you guessed right, coyotes. It looks tremendously silly, incredibly violent, and contains the line, “GET THE FUCK OFF MY HUSBAND.” That’s all I need. It’s directed by Colin Minihan (<em>What Keeps You Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grave Encounters</em>) and looks like some very schlocky fun.</p>   <p>The infinite arms of the&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em> franchise reach out yet again, this time with a collection of seven Halloween-themed shorts, one of which comes from director Casper Kelly, the man behind Adult Swim’s&nbsp;<em>Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stroker &amp; Hoop</em>, and the infamous <em>Infomercials</em> episode,&nbsp;<em>Too Many Cooks</em>. It’s on Shudder from today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Scared Shitless</em></h2>  <p>The final <strong>October 3</strong> release (you could watch new horror movies all night tonight!) is&nbsp;<em>Scared Shitless</em>, which looks like it should be hilarious, but the trailer doesn’t have me convinced. It looks like it’s trying a bit too hard with its glove puppet toilet monster and overly wacky goofs. If you recognize the older lead guy, that’s because he’s Steven Ogg, Trevor Phillips from <em>GTA V</em>! His son is played by Daniel Doheny (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) wearing what looks like his first beard, starring alongside the mighty Julian Richings and Mark McKinney. It’s the first theatrically released movie from Canadian comedy director Vivieno Caldinelli, who is more usually shooting skits for sketch shows.</p> <h2><em>Vicious</em></h2>  <p>Paramount Plus gets in on the spooky action <strong>October 10</strong> with Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;<em>Vicious</em>. It seems to set itself up as a film about a woman who is cursed to find three objects, one she loves, one she hates, and one she can’t live without, and put them all in a box before midnight. Should she fail, she’ll die. That’s a great premise, given how hard it would be to look inside yourself and answer those three questions truthfully, but the trailer suggests things are going in about seventy-three other directions too. Clearly Dakota Fanning is a big win for Paramount’s streamer, in a movie written and directed by Bryan “<em>The Strangers”</em> Bertino.</p> <h2><em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em></h2>  <p>On the same day, <strong>October 10</strong>, rival streamer Netflix has its own big-name horror release with <em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>. Kiera Knightley leads, with Guy Pearce (<em>Memento</em>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Confidential</em>) pulling off a very convincing British accent. It’s all about a reporter on a luxury yacht who thinks she sees a death, and is then hounded and gaslit by the super-posh people on board. Part scary thriller, part whodunnit mystery, it’s directed by Simon Stone, the Swiss director behind 2021’s well-respected&nbsp;<em>The Dig</em>.</p> <h2><em>Black Phone 2</em></h2>  <p>2021’s&nbsp;<em>The Black Phone</em> was an interesting choice for star Ethan Hawke. More usually mumbling through indie roles directed by Richard Linklater, here he jumped into the post-<em>Saw</em> trend for terrifying iconic horror villains: a serial child-killer known as the Grabber. Four years later, Hawke returns to the Blumhouse production for a classic-style sequel, with a should-be-dead enemy returning for revenge against the older cast of the original. Director Scott Derrickson is hit or miss, with a dreadful remake of <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and some middling horrors like&nbsp;<em>Sinister</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Gorge</em>, but he also gave us the solid <em>Doctor Strange.&nbsp;</em>The trailer looks fantastic, seeming to repeat the Wes Craven meets Stephen King ’70s vibes of the original. It’s out <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Frankenstein</em></h2>  <p>Netflix has funded Guillermo del Toro’s version of&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>, with a short theatrical release on <strong>October 17</strong> before it arrives on Netflix November 7. (Clearly the streamer thinks there could be trophies in this one.) It’s sticking to the gothic horror of Shelley’s novel, looking like a relatively faithful interpretation, albeit through del Toro’s extraordinary imagination, with Oscar Isaac (<em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Moon Knight</em>) <em>as</em> Dr. Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi (<em>Euphoria</em>) as his creation, alongside Mia Goth (<em>Pearl</em>, <em>Infinity Pool</em>) as Elizabeth. Del Toro doesn’t miss, so there’s every reason to be very excited for this one.</p> <h2><em>R.L. Stine’s Pumpkinhead</em></h2>  <p>I could pretend it wasn’t this trailer that made me want to write this entire article, but I’m not ashamed. 81-year-old Robert Lawrence Stine, the author of the&nbsp;<em>Goosebumps</em> novels, has his name glued to the title of this&nbsp;<em>Pumpkinhead</em> remake (the original starring Lance Henriksen came out in 1988), but he is neither writer nor director. Both those roles fall to Jem Garrard, the director behind last year’s Tubi queer vampire flick <em>Slay</em>. They are back with Tubi for this movie too, a kid-friendly (although not&nbsp;<em>that</em> friendly) film that reimagines the very adult original as something a touch more tame. It’s on Tubi <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</em></h2>  <p>Yup, it’s back. Curtis Hanson’s 1992 classic, starring Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay and Matt McCoy, as well as Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima, had one of the darkest plots of all time. A sexual predator is caught and kills himself, which causes his widowed wife to miscarry, and in turn drives her to seek revenge on one of his accusers by becoming her nanny and destroying her life. This time, however, the film is less thriller, more horror, given it’s directed by Mexican horror pro Michelle Garza Cervera. And it doesn’t seem to be following the original film’s motives for its characters, either, with nanny Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe of <em>Longlegs </em>and&nbsp;<em>It Follows</em>) hired by upper-class mom Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), who then begins infiltrating her life and marriage. But also, there’s some other weird darkness going on here, something more overtly creepy. It comes to Hulu and Disney+ <strong>October 22</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em></h2>  <p>Arriving on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>,&nbsp;<em>Shelby Oaks</em> looks fucking terrifying. It has the big boost of Mike Flanagan as an executive producer, and is directed by former YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann (<em>Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews</em>). There are some real mixed media vibes to the trailer, in a film about a woman trying to find her missing sister, and beginning to suspect that a demon they imagined in their childhoods might be a bit too real. Camille Sullivan (<em>She Talks to Strangers</em>) is the lead,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>‘s Michael Beach is here as a detective, and I’m delighted to say it also stars the always-wonderful Keith David.</p> <h2><em>In Our Blood</em></h2>  <p>“Indie horror” too often means rubbery monsters shot on iPhone, but that’s not the case here.&nbsp;<em>In Our Blood</em> has the vibes of an indie that scoops all the awards at a film festival, but harnessed here to deliver a super-weird and disturbing lo-fi movie about filmmakers making a documentary about reuniting with an estranged mother. However, she’s disappeared, and the reasons why are dark and terrible. It’s directed by Pedro Kos, who has been Oscar nominated for his documentaries, but now turns his hand to narrative. The lead is Brittany O’Grady, one of the stars of the first series of <em>The White Lotus</em>, without any other major names to take away the faux-realism of the flick. It’s in theaters <strong>October 24</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Queens of the</em> <em>Dead</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/george-a-romeros-daughter-zombie-drag-queen-movie-queens-trailer-2000626904">Tina Romero’s <em>Queens of the Dead</em></a> is an attempt to make her own mark following the legacy of her father’s movies. George A. Romero’s&nbsp;<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and its sequels are certainly memorable, but none of them followed the adventures of a group of drag queens and club kids attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. Sillier than her dad’s films, <a href="https://www.thecurb.com.au/suff-interview-tina-romero-queens-of-the-dead/">she says</a>,&nbsp;<em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a celebration of queer culture and aims to be uplifting in its politics during a very dark time in real life. Starring Jaquel Spivey (<em>Mean Girls 2024</em>), Katy O’Brian (<em>The Mandolorian</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>) and Margaret Cho, it’s getting fantastic early buzz, and will be on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>.</p>

Become the Undead Gunslinger, doomed to roam the barren lands until he finds the means to purge their curse and free his soul. No, this isn’t your typical Wild West desperado redemption arc. This is a damnation arc.</p><p><strong>Three Episodes Offering Over 20 Hours of Play</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Canyons, the Swamp, and the Mountains. Each swarming with abominable monsters and unholy demons, these are open-ended worlds for you to explore freely at your own pace. It will take the player over 20 hours on average to complete all three scenarios, and over 35 if they want to see everything the barren lands have to offer.</p><p><strong>Rewarding Classic <a title="Genres > Stealth [100 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">Stealth</a> <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">First-Person Shooter</a> Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Blood West</em> is a stealth first-person shooter inspired by the genre classics such as the <em>Thief</em> series (whose fans will be happy to hear the voice of Stephen Russell, the actor voicing the master-thief Garrett, returning here as the protagonist), <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> games, or—from the contemporary catalog—<em><a title="Games > Hunt: Showdown [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a></em>. The gameplay rewards the careful approach: scouting the area, stalking your enemies, and striking from the shadows. Can you figure out a way to clear a fort full of ghouls and monsters without raising an alarm?</p><p><strong>Weird West Legends Meet Eldritch <a title="Genres > Horror [722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">Horror</a></strong></p><p>The Barren Lands present the player with a nightmarish, twisted vision of the Wild West legends. The curse that has befallen the realm has corrupted every living thing, defiled the land itself, while summoning restless spirits and dark entities. In this mixture of gunslinger pulp and Lovecraftian horror, dark occult magick presents just as much of a threat as sudden lead poisoning.</p><p><strong>Unusual Characters and Their <a title="Platforms > Quest [157 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>lines</strong></p><p>In <em>Blood West</em> you will meet many colorful, yet strangely twisted, fully-voiced NPCs. Just as much prisoners of the Barren Lands as you are, they will sometimes share their unusual stories and send you on various missions. Play nice and they might reward you or become your allies. Cross them and risk their wrath.</p><p><strong>Non-Linear Maps Full of Secrets to Find</strong></p><p>The game won’t hold your hand. You’ll have to explore the land for yourself (buying a map from a vendor might prove useful!), and figure out your own way to approach quests. As you poke around the three expansive maps, keep an eye out for hidden places and secret stashes. There’s gold in the mountains! Fair warning—it’s probably cursed.</p><p><strong>Brutal Combat Against a Varied Cast of Foes</strong></p><p>If sneaking around isn’t exactly your thing, or you feel that you have a power advantage over your enemies, you can always take the head-on approach and meet your enemies guns blazing. <em>Blood West</em> comes from the creators of the fan-favorite boomer shooter <em><a title="Games > POSTAL: Brain Damaged [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/postal-brain-damaged">POSTAL: Brain Damaged</a></em>, so much gratuitous fantasy violence and pixelated blood splatter is to be expected!</p><p><strong>Scavenging and Resource <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong></p><p>One man’s hell might be another hoarder’s paradise! From simple one-use items like bandages, through medical tinctures, explosives and incendiaries, straight to arcane artifacts that—once slotted—can change the way you play the game, the Barren Lands are just filled with STUFF. There are tons of useful items to discover, and there’s a special player’s stash crate for all those super-rare potions that you’ll hoard and never use.</p><p><strong>Great Variety of Impactful Weapons</strong></p><p>A gunslinger without a gun would be just a regular slinger. Where’s the fun in that? <em>Blood West</em> makes sure you’ll have plenty of weapons to choose from. Revolvers, rifles, shotguns, carabines—a great variety of firearms, from standard army-issue to those infused with powerful magic, or straight-up possessed. And if you prefer not to cause a ruckus, there’s a wide selection of hand-to-hand combat weapons and archery weapons to pick your favorites from.</p><p><strong>Perk and Skill-Based Character Progression</strong></p><p>The <a title="Genres > RPG [17,689 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>-like perk-based progression system in <em>Blood West</em> will allow you to highly customize the gameplay experience to your liking. Become a stealthy hunter, a revolver-fanning gunman or a relentless berserker. You will gain experience and progress through the skill tree, while discovering new artifacts in each of the scenarios that will bestow on you additional abilities. Combining skills and load-out creates more possible playstyles than you’d normally be able to explore in one playthrough.</p><p>Are you ready to take back the frontier from the dark forces of demonic corruption and earn the right to move on to a better world? The Barren Lands call you, Gunslinger!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/blood-west-coming-to-ps5-xbox-series-on-october-16]]></content:encoded>

              <p>You don’t always have to buy new. The latest and greatest will work wonderfully, but you might be wasting your money depending on your exact needs. When it comes to laptops, for instance, maybe a nearly decade-old MacBook Air will suite you just fine. This Apple laptop originally from 2017 has been refurbished and presents a significantly cheaper option than buying new. This model first launched with a price tag of $999. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/">Since you waited all this time and decided to buy second-hand, you now only have to pay $180. That amounts to a savings of over $800.</a></p>
<p>Now I’m not going to pretend this product is right for everybody. In 9 out of 10 cases, you’re probably better off buying the latest model MacBook Air, new — or, at the very least, buying one that’s just a couple years old at this point. If you plan on doing any kind of intensive workflows whether that’s video and photo editing or playing games, this 2017 MacBook Air will leave a lot to be desired. However, if you really just need a knockaround laptop for some easy web browsing, email sending, or word processing, this refurbished artifact from the President’s first term might fit the bill.</p>

<p>What we have here is a 13.3-inch widescreen retina display laptop working with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. It’s Intel Core i5 1.8Ghz processor can help you check items off your daily to-do list. You can stream and render high-quality video with the Intel HD Graphics 6000 in resolutions of up to 1440 by 900 pixels. The on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth will let you stay connected to the internet as well as your peripherals like earbuds or a wireless mouse.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air has a silver aluminum case which include multiple USB ports as well as an SD card slot.</p>



<h2>Grade A/B Refurbished</h2>
<p>StackSocial has this refurbished 2017 MacBook Air marked with a Grade A/B rating. This rating guarantees that the unit that will ship to you will arrive in near-mint condition. The site defines that as minimal to zero amount of scuffing on the case along with battery health that can maintain at least 80% of its original effectiveness. For this laptop, that works out to about 12 hours of life on once charge. The MacBook Air also ships with a MagSafe wall charger.</p>
<p>So if you are just looking for something cheap that can get the job done, or perhaps are working on the final touches to your&nbsp;<em>The Rehearsal</em>‘s Nathan Fielder costume, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/">then look no further than this 2017 refurbished MacBook Air — now just $180.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Payday developer Starbreeze <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">announced</a> yesterday that it has ceased development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/12/04/starbreeze-announces-project-baxter-a-new-dungeons-dragons-cooperative-multiplayer-game">Project Baxter</a>, its cooperative game set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The cancellation will result in layoffs at the studio.</p><p>Project Baxter was first announced in December 2023 with a 2026 launch window, and was billed as an Unreal Engine 5-developed cooperative multiplayer Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. It was also described as a live-service game, though the extent of which was never made clear. Project Baxter was slated to launch on all major platforms and would have supported cross-play.</p><p>Although we don't know what state Project Baxter was in for Starbreeze to abandon the game, the company states that after a strategic review, its management and the board of directors determined it would be financially healthier to divert the resources allocated to Project Baxter to “accelerate the growth” of its flagship Payday franchise.</p><p>“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Adolf Kristjansson, CEO of Starbreeze. “Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

<p>Payday 3</p>

</article>
<p>Although Starbreeze states that some of the Project Baxter development team will be reassigned to other projects (mostly Payday), it plans to let go of 44 employees and contractors in an effort to “enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026.”</p><p>“I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support,” says Kristjansson. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.”</p><p>Starbreeze’s last release, Payday 3, was released in September 2023 in a troubled state and failed to hit sales expectations (here's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/payday-3/a-turbulent-yet-successful-heist">our review</a>). This resulted in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/starbreeze-studios-ceo-out-less-than-six-months-after-payday-3-launch">departure of then-CEO Tobias Sjögren</a> less than six months later. In December 2024, 15 percent of Starbreeze's staff were laid off.

			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">nominations for the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a> are now live, with players being able to vote across 21 categories, and while some years are tight races between the games that have made the most impact before the end of the year, this year has a clear frontrunner in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut title has six total nominations, including a nomination for best studio, but interestingly, Clair Obscur misses out on some bigger categories, including Console Game of the Year. It is however, up for Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, Best Soundtrack, Best Leading Performer for Jennifer English as Maelle, and Best Supporting Performer with Ben Starr getting the nomination for his role as Verso.</p>



<p>Other big titles with multiple nominations include Hollow Knight Silksong, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Ghost of Yotei. Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2, and Kingdom Come: Delieverance 2 are all tied for second place behind Clair Obscur in the nominations race with four nominations each.</p>



<p>The Ultimate Game of the Year category is still to come, so it's possible that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and some of the titles behind it will each add another tally to their nominations, but we'll have to wait until November 3, 2025, for that nominations list to be revealed. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">When Wccftech reviewed</a> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year, we said it had "<em>a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics</em>."</p>



<p>While the nominees for the Golden Joysticks Awards 2025, and every year, are selected by a judging panel, the voting and the winners are all decided by public votes, making them a pretty fair representation of what players really consider to be the best-of-the-best in videogames each year. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Black Myth: Wukong took home the prize for Ultimate Game of the Year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest Alinea Analytics weekly newsletter <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/skate-leads-augusts-top-games-by?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=175193486&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzk2MzIzNjYsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE3NTE5MzQ4NiwiaWF0IjoxNzU5NTAwODMyLCJleHAiOjE3NjIwOTI4MzIsImlzcyI6InB1Yi01MTQxNjgxIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.k6fLS3NJWH8VKEUKSnCzgeboV8BNaHVEDfcpCN0-JDw&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is out</a>, and analyst Rhys Elliott (featured often on Wccftech with exclusive interviews) could not avoid tackling the subject of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion EA buyout by the so-called Consortium</a>. More specifically, Elliott highlighted the $20 billion debt <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others had already pointed to</a> as a potential cause for upcoming layoffs at EA. </p>



<p>According to the Alinea Analytics analyst, IP sales and/or studio divestitures are going to be on the table. BioWare is clearly a chief candidate, but he also namedropped Motive (which is currently developing the Iron Man single player game and also helping with Battlefield 6) as another studio where the axe might fall eventually.</p>



<p><em>$20B in debt is a ticking time bomb. While EA’s cash flow ($2 billion to $2.5 billion) can certainly contribute to serving this debt, $20 billion in junk-rated (single-B) debt is a looming shadow. And in LBO land, this kind of debt often means ‘’efficiencies’’, which is PR spin for mass layoffs and cuts. Expect layoffs, departures, and cuts, probably deep ones. Many of the cuts will happen outside of the money-making sports games (but nothing will be safe from the efficiency cuts). Anything non-service or slow-building will be on the chopping block first.</em></p>



<p><em>IP sales and studio divestitures are on the table. Many of the cost-cutters will ask themselves, “Why keep a $200 million RPG team when FIFA cards print cash?’’ Single-player studios like BioWare (Mass Effect) and Motive (Iron Man) are in most trouble. BioWare was arguably already in management’s crosshairs before this buyout. Add the studio’s LGBTQI+-friendly nature and its themes on human rights into the mix, and this could spell trouble.</em></p>



<p>The analysis then singled out PIF, the sovereign public investment fund of the Saudi Arabian government. Like many others, Elliott believes that the EA buyout is largely an attempt to diversify PIF's portfolio in the long term as they move away from oil, and also to try and make the world forget about the human rights issues that are still present in the country. This is just the latest in a long series of steps, which include, just in the gaming space, investments in Nexon, Take-Two, CAPCOM, Nintendo, and the Embracer Group. They also acquired Scopely (which, in turn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired Niantic's gaming division</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrine’s Legacy is a 16-bit action RPG that releases on PC on October 7. It tells the story of young heroes Rio and Reima as they try to banish an ancient evil and save the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take one look at screenshots and you can tell the game’s aesthetic was inspired by the SNES era of RPGs. The whole game can be played solo or in two-person co-op, either through couch co-op or online via Remote Play or Parsec. If you play co-op, each of you controls either Rio (a melee fighter) or Reima (a ranged mage). If you play solo, you can swap between the two characters at any time, with AI taking over whichever one you’re not controlling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was primarily made by the two-man dev team of longtime friends Alan Gabbard and Joseph Duke, with some help from other friends along the way. It’s the first release for their company Positive Concept Games, has been several years in the making, and was helped along by a successful Kickstarter campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate the game’s impending release, we had a wide-ranging chat with Alan and Joseph. We touched on everything from their inspirations (which range from Chrono Trigger to Hollow Knight), to Shrine’s Legacy’s gameplay and story, to their plans for releasing on other platforms.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You two have been friends for a long time. At what point did you decide you wanted to create games together?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph Duke:</strong> Funny enough, we've been working together on games almost as long as we've been friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan Gabbard:</strong> It was back in high school where I first met Joe in health class. I was a sophomore and Joe was a junior — for context, we are in our 30s now. One day, we began talking about our love for Super Nintendo games. Joseph had already dabbled a lot in RPG Maker and programming in general, and I had a passion for the writing and storytelling aspect in video games. Joe pitched me to come up with a storyline for a space shooter project he was working on, which sadly never came to fruition. However, I pitched the idea for what would eventually become Shrine's Legacy and that's when we got to work creating our first game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/4-1758753114930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>It’s immediately clear that you were inspired by the SNES era. What games in particular were your favorites from that era, and what parts of Shrine’s Legacy did they inspire?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan:</strong> My favorite SNES games are Chrono Trigger, Terranigma, and Zelda: A Link to the Past. We got a lot of inspiration with our combat from Zelda and Terranigma, while Illusion of Gaia and Super Metroid inspired how we designed maps and level progression within dungeons. We take a lot of influence from Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, and the Soul Blazer games when it comes to storytelling, dialogue writing, and the general moment-to-moment gameplay feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph:</strong> My favorite Super Nintendo games are Final Fantasy VI, Terranigma and the other Soul Blazer games, Chrono Trigger, a Link to the Past, and Super Metroid. And really even more, my list would be huge if I kept going. So many inspirations have gone into Shrine's Legacy, and Alan explains them well. To add to what he said, many people would see Secret of Mana influence, and that is true, mostly in terms of the co-op multiplayer aspect.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nostalgia is powerful, but gaming has advanced a lot in the last 30 years. How difficult was it to balance staying true to your retro inspirations while also modernizing gameplay?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph:</strong> Balancing hasn't been terribly difficult, but we did make an effort to include options that many people expect, including setting the screen scale, rebindable inputs, controller support in addition to keyboard, button styles based on your controller, etc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan:</strong> We are trying our damnedest to keep some of that old-school SNES challenge in combat intact (players can look forward to a Hard Mode setting post-launch) but also acknowledge that dying and having to retry difficult sections of a modern game can be frustrating. We have a "Retry" option for bosses that prove especially finicky so players can skip all the cutscenes leading up to the boss fights. Dying in any other part of the game will also reload you back to the most recent save point. And while there are no auto-saves, players are fully healed at each save point. It's a tricky balance between quality of life while retaining some challenge.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/5-1758753166027.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Games with a focus on couch co-op are few and far between these days. Was that always something baked into the DNA of Shrine’s Legacy? Or did you land on it during the course of development?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: It was always our intention to have a co-op capability from the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Yes, it was always planned. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The game can be played solo and you can switch characters on the fly, with AI controlling whichever protagonist you aren’t playing as. How difficult was that to implement, and why was it important to you that it be playable solo or in co-op?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Because Alan and I really enjoyed playing games together. We wish more Final Fantasy games included co-op, I believe they even removed it from later re-releases of Final Fantasy IX! Implementing it has indeed led to some challenges. We opted to try and keep the functionality as simple as possible, but there are certain downsides to that strategy. The AI character stays close to Player 1 during combat, so that the better you dodge, the more likely the AI is to also dodge. Occasionally though, they still find themselves getting hit when you don't. I don't think it'll harm the gameplay too much, but it might be something that gets some improvements over time as we update the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Since it was planned from the start of development, adding co-op hasn't been the most daunting interference with the process of making Shrine's Legacy. As two friends that love RPGs, we have always felt not enough RPG games have true co-op options. Secret of Mana showed us that you can make a SNES-style action RPG that can be played solo or with friends in cooperative gameplay. That's why it was important for us to achieve what the Mana games were doing in terms of sharing the experience with loved ones on the couch...or at a computer monitor for this initial PC release.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Gameplay is obviously important, but a good RPG also needs a compelling story. How important to you were the world building, characters, and narrative of Shrine’s Legacy?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Very important. One thing we didn't figure out until some ways in was how important humor and levity is in an otherwise mostly dramatic story. Luckily, we had plenty of time to sprinkle those things in. The story script actually went through several drafts over years before it was final. This was mostly from us leveling up our design game over time as we learned more. It's still a fairly simple story, but we were determined to make the characters shine in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: I mentioned before that Final Fantasy and the Soul Blazer trilogy were instrumental to the narrative and dialogue. I approached the story as though we were telling something akin to a classic Final Fantasy tale, think Final Fantasy IV or Final Fantasy V. It was important to have a strong sense of balance between dramatic storytelling and levity like so many great JRPGs of the past had. The characters drive this story and the worldbuilding supplements that. Of course, outside mediums influenced how I wrote the story and characters. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my biggest influences in that regard.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/9-1758753200115.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How would you describe the tone of the story?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Shrine's Legacy is largely a fun fantasy adventure romp like so many classic JRPGs that are beloved. However, the tone shifts to a more dramatic feel where appropriate, especially in the latter half of the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Can you tell us about the exploration and dungeons? Is exploration linear or are there secret areas to unlock?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: The world of Shrine's Legacy is quite large and dense, especially for an indie game. There are tons of secrets and hidden spots, even a few completely optional areas and dungeons you could easily miss out on if you rush through the game. It's mostly linear in progression order, but there are points where the story opens up and gives you options of what to tackle next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: JRPGs of the old days had a tendency to disguise their linearity quite well and would sometimes let you tackle certain story beats out of order. I'm happy to say Shrine's Legacy does the same thing! It's not completely linear, but it has enough linearity to tell a focused story. There are plenty of secrets to find and a few dungeons can be completed out of the intended order!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Do all dungeons include boss fights? How varied are they, and what would you say is the difficulty level of those fights?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan: </strong>Not all dungeons have a boss battle, but most do. Every boss fight is very different, many requiring use of some puzzle knowledge to defeat. The difficulty is meant to amp up the further you progress in the game. We'll be adding a few miniboss battles after the game launches, plus the hardest boss battles in the game, which unfortunately had to be cut due to time. More importantly, we'd like to adjust boss and enemy AI for our planned Hard Mode. We are even considering an eventual boss rush mode...</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I believe there are two mini-dungeons that don't have a true boss fight, but every single other dungeon does. There are only a couple reskin bosses, but even they look and act different than their original counterpart. Every other boss is completely unique and a lot of effort went into designing them. As for difficulty, this is no Hollow Knight or Silksong. While the game tries to deliver a challenge, it gives you many ways to become stronger i.e. by exploring for treasure, grinding levels, making potions that can heal or buff you during the battle if you are struggling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you might be surprised to learn that Hollow Knight did encourage a lot of the design philosophy for how the bosses themselves function. We tried to approach boss design in a "each battle is a dance" kind of way where you must respect the patterns of the boss and react accordingly. And like Alan mentions, we'd love to make a truly Hard Mode whenever we can. Not a simple numbers buff, but a true rework of how you have to play the game that makes every boss a truly fearsome foe.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/2-1758753227141.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How about puzzles? Are there lots of them, and are they required to progress or are they optional to find gear and items?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: There are a lot of puzzles in the game. You use magic spells in combat, but they also have practical uses on the field for traversal and solving puzzles. Think of it like Link's toolkit in Zelda games. Which, if I'm being honest, about 50% of Shrine's Legacy's DNA is a Zelda-like. We're still an action RPG at heart, but I'm confident Zelda-like fans would enjoy our game if they don't mind a little more story and dialogue than normal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: There are lots of both required and optional puzzles, though we try to keep the puzzle difficulty and length on the lower end to keep the pace of the game strong.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How long would you estimate it will take a new player to complete a playthrough?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I would say anywhere from 12–28 hours depending on your pace and level of completion. Probably around 18 hours on average.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Anywhere from 16–20 hours on a casual playthrough. Doing everything will take about 25–30 hours for a first-timer without a guide.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>We know about the game’s release on Steam. Are there plans to bring it to other platforms in the future?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: We are also releasing on GOG and Epic on October 7! We plan to bring Shrine's Legacy to Nintendo Switch as soon as humanly possible after launching on PC. PlayStation and Xbox depends on how well sales go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I'll only add that the goal is to try and get the Switch port out by early next year. The whole process will be a learning process though, as it's not something we've ever done before and I don't know how much effort it'll be yet. I guess what I'm saying is please be patient with us!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/3-1758753417977.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to say to players eager to get their hands on Shrine’s Legacy?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Shrine's Legacy has been a labor of love and years and years of hard work. It won't be perfect on launch, no game is, but we are going to keep supporting it for some time. We want this game to be as incredible as it can be. But more than anything, I hope it brings you back to the good old times when games were weird, fun, and bold in their design decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: More than anything, I hope we've delivered on the promises we made with our Kickstarter campaign. Some of those promises will have to be fulfilled after launch (like getting to wear a Postcat hat). We've spent the better part of a decade creating this first commercial game, so we hope the wait was worthwhile to everyone excited. Be sure to tell your friends and loved ones to join in on a co-op session with you! Because, really, getting to see strangers play our baby in co-op will be rewarding in and of itself. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of our game dev careers and we attain enough success to keep making more art through video games. We love and appreciate all of our supporters throughout all these years. Thank you, and enjoy!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-two-man-dev-team-of-shrines-legacy-discusses-its-retro-inspirations-gameplay-narrative-and-more]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games' Phasmophobia came from humble beginnings, with a single developer bringing to life their vision for casting players as paranormal investigators and then letting them loose to explore spooky environments and be terrorized by a variety of malevolent entities.</p><p dir="ltr">Its success was impressive and has even paved the way for other social-multiplayer games to achieve similar success. But now, Kinetic is preparing to take another big step forward. And although it has the attention of Hollywood, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/" data-ref-id="1100-6532047">with a big-screen adaptation now in the works in partnership with Blumhouse Productions</a>, the devs are staying focused on making sure its players have plenty to look forward to too.</p><p dir="ltr">We recently spoke to Daniel Knight and Asim Tanvir from Kinetic to discuss the success of the game, as well as what the future holds for it and the team.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2125108981"

the game now. And we're not doing the larger ones anymore. So, what unique small maps could we do? I'm not sure what led us in the direction of diner.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Asim Tanvir: </strong>We see it from the community and the player data, that the smaller maps, the players like them more.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Something like 70% of the players just play Tanglewood Drive, so now we're trying to create maps that are a similar size, so the diner aligns with that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What lessons have you learned from making bigger maps like Brownstone High School or the prison? How does it feel to make something like the prison and the high school, and see the data that so few people play them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It takes a long time to make those maps. But we are reworking all the maps, which includes the prison and school, similar to how we reworked Sunny Meadows. And we might be making the prison and the school smaller as a part of that rework, as well as making them a lot higher quality. Because currently in the school there's a lot of rooms that are more or less the same. So we want all the rooms as unique as possible. Which is why when we did the Grafton Farmhouse rework, we cut out some of the bedrooms to make them more unique, and added certain things like mannequins and dolls.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Now we have a big team. A big art team and an art director as well. So Grafton and the Bleasdale farmhouse rework is what their focus is. Bleasdale is ornate looking, while Grafton is the opposite. It's dark and dingy. Dilapidated.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight</strong>: The reason why we do stuff like that in reworking maps is because we want the game to have an identity beyond the game mechanics. Because I used stock Unity assets to make the game initially, you can go into other games and see the same assets.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So it really sounds like the major push is graphical fidelity, allowing the game to have its own identity, and refining what's already there. A lot of my experience and relationship with the game is playing with friends and laughing at how the character models move. Like the infamous bendy backs. We still love the game, and get very scared, but it's formed alongside the game's visual quirks as well.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I know replacing the character models is a part of the roadmap. And I understand that if you want the game to have a higher benchmark, then that means changing the character models too. I just hope there's a toggle for the original character models and bendy backs. </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Now that the team has grown, and its primary focus is Phasmaphobia, do you have any thoughts on Kinetic Games becoming more an entity outside of being a one-man-studio when Phasmaphobia first began development. How are you viewing the growth and identity of Kinetic Games beyond just Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was very hard getting into the headspace to hire people. Even when we decided to bring it to consoles, it was still only five of us. That's when we decided to start hiring more designers, more artists. Now there's 32 of us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have ideas for other games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Yeah. There's always ideas in the back of my head all the time.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Once Phasmaphobia releases Horror 2.0, then we'll start thinking about new stuff. So nothing concrete we're working on right now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Daniel, in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/phasmophobia-devs-look-back-on-5-years-of-success/2300-6465841/" data-ref-id="2300-6465841">previous interview</a> with GameSpot, you admitted you didn't really play horror games. Has making Phasmaphobia changed your perspective on horror games, or playing them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I think for me, it's interesting to watch people play, and watch them still be scared even if they're playing with three of their friends. Most horror games, even multiplayer ones, everyone's just kind of running away from each other. And I wanted to make a game where the players are actually experiencing the horror together.</p><p dir="ltr">And it was interesting to see that's what actually happened when Phasmaphobia launched. I didn't do much play testing before the game's release. I just wanted to get it out there and just see what people did with it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have you ever been scared by your own game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>There's definitely been moments. We're adding new stuff into the game as well, and we're always hearing people in the office getting jump scared. QA team, art team, programming team – you can hear them screaming from across the office.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is it like having an office full of people scared all the time?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>It means things are working.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Since you're a fan of horror films, what's it like now working with Blumhouse Productions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Oh yeah, I like most of their stuff already. I think The Conjuring Series are my favorite.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's your favorite of The Conjuring films?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The second one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's the right answer. You've mentioned in a previous interview that you're fan of shows like Ghost Adventurers, was there a horror movie or show that specifically inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The Haunting of Hill House was the big one, because it was mostly tension based. Then there's a TV series called The Terror. Those two were the main two that inspired Phasmaphobia.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>If movies and TV primarily inspired Phasmaphobia, and you don't play horror games, what kind of games do you play? And any that inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I don't have too much time to play games. But I've been playing a lot of Rematch. I prefer to play games where I can jump in for 30 minutes and stop. It's one of the reasons why I designed Phasmaphobia that way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kinetic Games has been getting a lot of press recently because of the movie deal and staffing up the team, releasing new maps and redesigning old ones. What are some of the things you don't get to talk about as much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>When the game was so successful at the start, I think a lot of people assumed we were a 200 person team, and I'd say no. It was just me. And when people started finding out that it wasn't some massive team, everyone seemed a little confused. We're even still getting that now, even with the 32 people we have now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When did you realize you needed to hire people?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was seven or eight months after release. I think I was working 60 plus hours a week. Every day, and on the weekends. And it got to a point where I couldn't do that for years and years. So I had to hire people so I could have a life.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What were you doing for a living when you first started developing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I had been out of work for a while. I didn't have a lot of experience making a game. I just wanted to try and do it, and stuck with that for a while.</p><p dir="ltr">I really wanted to work for myself. I was living with my parents at the time which made things significantly easier.</p><p dir="ltr">My parents told me it was time to get a real job. Even me at the time, I didn't have any real expectations for the game. My goal was to sell a thousand copies, and that was surpassed in a few hours after it was released.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You started the game alone and used existing assets. So the identity of the game was in its mechanics. Then it got in the hands of the community, and they started to inform the game's identity in culture. Now, you have a team of people working on the game, changing the way it looks, and polishing it up. Where do you strike the balance of your vision, the communities expectations, but also that of a team and how they're contributing? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>90% of it is the teams' vision, which a lot of it comes from me. But when the game was released, I couldn't get every feature in there that I wanted. So a lot of the work we're doing now is kind of getting that done. And now we're getting input from the art team which is great. We take in community feedback, obviously. Every month we're doing a feedback form on our Discord. We go through all of that. It doesn't necessarily shape how we move forward, but it informs minor changes we make.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the one thing the community asks for that you will not put in the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>One of the biggest requests we get is to allow players to be able to capture the ghost after identifying it.

            <title><![CDATA[Wayward Is A Queer Exploration Of The Troubled Teen Industry]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wayward-is-a-queer-exploration-of-the-troubled-teen-industry.1315966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wayward</em> is the latest show by comedian and <em>Feel Good</em> creator Mae Martin, a Netflix series about the darkness at the heart of the “<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/resources/newsletters/childrens-rights/five-facts-about-troubled-teen-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">troubled teen</a>” industry. I watched it because I’m a sucker for anything that hints at being about cults, and while I liked a lot of the show, its take on trans masculinity made me a little uneasy.&nbsp;</p><p>Martin plays Alex Dempsey, a cop who moves with his pregnant wife Laura to the small Vermont town of Tall Pines. Laura went to Tall Pines Academy, an institute for troubled teens run by Evelyn Wade. Once Tall Pines students graduate, they’re given homes and jobs in the town, which gives Evelyn a lot of sway over how things work and a particularly intimate relationship with Laura and the rest of the school’s graduates. Almost immediately after moving in, Alex becomes aware that things aren’t as idyllic as they seem, when he encounters one of the Academy’s frequent runaways who makes him wonder what’s actually going on behind the school’s walls and why the town seems so content to look the other way.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wayward | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kSNuohhKyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s a second plotline featuring teen best friends Leila and Abbie; Abbie is sent to Tall Pines by her parents, and Leila gets stuck there when she breaks in to rescue Abbie. It’s in this plotline that <em>Wayward</em> takes its most straightforward political aim at the industry the show focuses on: kids are mistreated and belittled, made to do senseless manual labor, turned against each other, and face other abuses that Martin described to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/wayward-mae-martin-juicy-trans-character-hypermasculinity-1236555341/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> as “a useful metaphor for all of the sort of oppressive systems that we are seduced by.” They’re forced to play a <a href="https://synanon.com/the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Synanon-style game</a> where they berate each other under the guise of honesty, and all of this starts to drive a wedge between Leila and Abbie, even as they’re forced to work together to try to escape the Academy. This plotline also explores the nature of teen relationships: how long-lasting should they be, and how can they affect the trajectory of your life?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Abbie and Leila work with Alex to uncover abuses at the Academy, while Alex discovers increasingly creepy facts about the town. <em>Wayward</em> started to stretch the bounds of credulity to me a little bit here, especially in regards to a much-touted and much-feared treatment Evelyn doles out. In some ways, the show is deeply rooted in the realities of the self-help and teen behavior industry, and how the good intentions of hippie movements lost their way over time. But as it goes on it starts to drift away from how the school’s philosophy–breaking a cycle of toxicity passed down in the relationship from parent to child–undergirds its structure and practices and more into a grab-bag of abuses and vague, unrealistic-feeling fare involving drugs and rituals. Dramatically, I get this, but as a tiresome stickler for media about <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cults</a>, I found myself wishing it had stayed a little more grounded.</p><p>It’s a very queer show: Leila is attracted to both men and women, there are many queer folks in the town, and Alex is a trans man. People are very accepting of all this, which comes up right away when Laura takes pains to explain that Tall Pines’ roots as a 70s hippie commune makes it more liberal than one might expect for small town Vermont. No one misgenders Alex or anything like that, and while I think the show would have been dragged down by adding “trans man tries to fit in with small town police force” to all the topics it tackles, pretending queer discrimination simply doesn’t exist the way some media about queer people does these days might make sense as a narrative choice, but always comes off a little forced to me.</p><p>Most notably to me, though, is the way that Alex struggles with his own tendency toward violence. <em>Something </em>happened in his old job in Detroit, and there are several instances in Tall Pines when he responds with undue violence to a situation in front of him. I won’t say it isn’t weird to root for Martin playing a cop (Martin told Deadline, “I hope people get that [<em>Wayward </em>is] not pro-cop”), and the use of excessive force definitely fits within that narrative. But Alex’s violent streak also gets tied to his gender: Martin, who is nonbinary and on a low dose of testosterone, told Deadline that Alex is “definitely someone who’s seduced by and yearning for that kind of heteronormative hypermasculinity and a nuclear family” that working as a cop and having a wife and child offer.&nbsp;</p><p>In a confrontation with Evelyn, she tells Alex, “It must be hard to search for yourself your whole life, only to realize you are a violent cliche… How many people do you have to hurt before self-defense feels like a hollow refrain?... You love an idea of [Laura] because it makes you feel like a real man.” But I didn’t feel like I ever saw Alex himself grappling with his gender in relation to his family or behavior; something I liked about the show was that it had a trans man who had other things going on than transitioning. To me, this stood in contrast to characters like Evelyn bringing it up, or Martin pointing it out in interviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The idea that testosterone makes trans men angry or violent is a <a href="https://www.folxhealth.com/library/9-myths-you-might-have-believed-about-testosterone-hrt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myth</a> perpetuated not just by transphobes, but sometimes by people within queer and trans communities. I’ve seen it used by people I know as reasons not to go on hormones, and I’ve had it used against me when I’ve had disagreements with people in my life who had negative feelings about trans men. I felt uncomfortable seeing <em>Wayward</em> flirt with the idea, especially in a character not written or played by a trans man, especially when trans men are so seldom seen in media. At the same time, Alex is a much more complicated character than just his gender identity, so I don’t think it’s just a matter of cliches, but I definitely felt uneasy about it.</p><p>Despite feeling unsure of <em>Wayward</em>’s portrayal of trans men, it had enough drama and intrigue to inspire me to watch the series in a weekend, and it ends on a note that would make me interested in a second season <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/02/a-surprising-update-on-wayward-season-2-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it gets one</a>. (You never know with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>, of course.) I was a big fan of <em>Feel Good</em>, so I was glad to see another show by Martin; if you’re into their work, or just some drama about teens, <em>Wayward</em> is worth checking out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Morbid Metal is vicious. It’s ready to tear its steel-like teeth through the unwary player, soft fingers and pliable plastic controller at a loss to the visceral violence unfolding in front of them. Morbid Metal provided a gleaming, grinding antithesis to the candy-coloured RPGs found elsewhere at TGS, and as a statement of intent for developer Felix Schade, who started this project on his own, it’s a brutal barrage of expertly-tuned violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Characters Trailer - Games Baked In Germany" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUbz2F7Du58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Morbid Metal is a roguelite. Structurally, that’s the zeitgeist, the norm, the expectation, of gaming in 2025, and it’s interesting to see how well it now fits into modern gaming and modern attention spans. What that means is that death is part of the plan, with your incremental improvements, your first stuttering steps, slowly becoming firmer, stronger and more assured as you grow, both in knowledge and skill.</p>


<p>It all feels like a natural fit here. Morbid Metal doles out its first death with gleeful abandon, and your initial robotic warrior barely lasts more than a few minutes. I like to think I’m pretty handy with a dodge button and a sword – I’ve lived and breathed games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Nier Automata – but I still found myself wanting as I got used to the speed and ferocity of the enemies in the opening areas. Back to the start…</p>


<p>The movement is an immediate highlight, with a great sense of speed and certainty produced by the tight controls. That’s exemplified by the enjoyable platforming you take part in between each encounter, and I’m hoping that this forms a key part of the game’s progression. The central cog, though, is combat. Drawing on games like Bayonetta, a perfectly timed dodge will result in a brief counter-attack window. From there, you can take any angle you want and cause untold damage to any enemy brazen enough to be in range. It’s extremely satisfying to get the timing just right.</p>
<p>As you arrive in each area, you’re locked into a battleground arena, invisible walls setting in place the locale for some severe sword-based action. Completing that skirmish then gives you the choice of three potential upgrades, beefing up your abilities, and letting you tailor your loadout to your playstyle.</p>

<p>That’s made more complicated as you unlock the alternative forms of fighter. Flux, your initial warrior form, is slick and swift, recognisably familiar to fans of Dante and Bayonetta. Your second form, Ekka, slows things down, giving you a massive two-handed blade that eviscerates the defences of shield-bearing enemies and utterly changes up the way you play. More forms will be available through the full game, providing distinctive styles to blend together.</p>
<p>Not only can you shapeshift between different forms in the midst of battle and even a combo, the upgrade options can apply to individual moves for individual forms, making your decisions harder than ever to weigh up. Get the right upgrades, though, and you can really start to roll through the world, with inflated damage making short work of enemies. The choices get trickier as you find Devil’s Bargains, which can give both positive and negative effects, such as boosting the critical chance for both your attacks and those of your enemies, adding further risk and reward to your build.</p>

<p>The world of Morbid Metal looks absolutely fantastic. The metallic foes are all instantly identifiable, and their brutalist design makes them all the more satisfying to destroy. From there you move between the enticing natural decay of some areas through to the unbridled futurism of others, and I can’t wait to see where the journey through the game will take you as you delve ever deeper into Schade’s vision.</p>
<p>The demo built up to an encounter with a robotic monkey boss, Saru, leaping around the arena, unleashing energy pulses to try and dodge. It’s a fun encounter, dashing in and out to deal damage, targeting his fists for locational damage which can affect the attacks he later unleashes.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saru (from Morbid Metal) - Music Video | Blue Stahli" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu2ewImdfuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is all complemented by a soundtrack that, on first impressions alone, is going to absolutely rip. You can check out the music video for Saru right now, composed by Blue Stahli, and it’s a heady mix of metalcore guitar work and thumping trance beats, which feel like the perfect fit for the fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping combat.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently seen with Lost Soul Aside, publishers are peeking into the world of solo devs and finding a rich vein of talent and creativity that’s been shorn of the wear and tear of large-scale commercial development. Borne from a university project, Schade subsequently spun Morbid Metal’s development team out into his own company, SCREEN JUICE, before aligning with Ubisoft, one of the biggest publishers in the world. You’d have to hope that we see more of this sort of thing.</p>
<p>With its stylish visuals and slick combat, Morbid Metal could join games like Hades and Risk of Rain as a go-to roguelite. It ties together the instinctive action gameplay of Devil May Cry and Bayonetta with a progression system that rewards commitment and study. I can’t wait to see more when the game arrives in Early Access.</p>
<p><em>If you’re interested in checking Morbid Metal out for yourself, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">you can download the demo via Steam right now</a>, and sign up to a playtest that will feed the planned early access release</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced path traced global illumination to the PC version of War Thunder</a>, significantly improving visual quality over the game's previous ray traced global illumination solution. </p>



<p>In doing so, War Thunder joined an extremely elite club of games that feature real-time path tracing: <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rt-overdrive-mode-is-the-new-pinnacle-of-graphics-and-performance-on-an-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, DESORDRE, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-pc-performance-benchmarks-nvidia-dlss-3-5-path-tracing-photorealistic-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, Black Myth: Wukong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-path-tracing-incredible-performance-cost-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F1 25</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages (whose developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-tracing-took-six-months-to-implement-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just opened on on their path tracing implementation</a>), and FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's second game on this list.</p>



<p>We contacted Gaijin to organize an email interview that would dive deeply into this tech advancement for War Thunder and the whole Dagor Engine (also used in other games published by the studio, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/enlisted-devs-talk-about-crossplay-progression-system-and-dx12-ultimate-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MMOFPS Enlisted</a>). At last, we received the responses back, courtesy of Anton Yudintsev (co-founder of Gaijin Entertainment), László Perneky (lead programmer), and Gergo Horvath (programmer). You can find them after the embedded footage.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="War Thunder 4K HDR Full Ray Tracing - USA Tank Crew &amp; Sound Mod RWSM IV Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oArxTRcbGW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>How long did it take for you to implement Path Traced Global Illumination in the Dagor Engine? Was it complex to go from ray tracing to path tracing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> The ray tracing framework we have is very flexible. We can reconstruct any surface on the whole map with quality very close to rasterized ones, and we keep the ray traced scene in sync with the rasterized scene. With this at our disposal, the first working prototype went fast, in just a couple of weeks. But then the devil is in the details. We had to make sure the results were good in all cases. When rendering airplane cockpits, you need special considerations compared to rendering a tank from behind. We needed to prepare PTGI for all the cases the player can encounter.</p>



<p>Performance is also a big concern. PTGI replaces RT ambient occlusion, which gives us some headroom but is also much heavier, so we needed to make tons of small decisions on optimizations. In the end, we spent about a month on the initial version, but we are still tweaking/refining it ever since.</p>



<p><strong>Will the open source version of the Dagor Engine be updated with path tracing support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Probably by the end of the year.</p>



<p><strong>Do you consider the Leviathan update to have added the final version of PTGI, or do you believe there is still room for improvement? If so, is it for quality, performance, or both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> There is almost always room for improvement for both quality and performance. While the idea of Path Tracing itself is “uber-solution”, implying that we achieve the best possible result by tracing lighting data for each pixel, in reality, a naive approach would be prohibitively slow (~8 million rays with few bounces each), so virtually all real-time solutions use some form of temporal upscaling and so, some kind of denoising. And that would be an area of improvement for visual quality. Also, each game uses its own set of tricks for achieving faster ray-tracing itself (especially for foliage, etc). Performance-wise, it is always possible to do something, although eventually, efforts start to provide diminishing returns. That said, we are rather satisfied with both quality and performance for such quality achieved.</p>



<p><strong>You wrote that you are planning to add support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-ada-lovelaces-opacity-micro-maps-feature-and-how-it-can-boost-ray-tracing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM)</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ada-lovelace-follow-up-qa-dlss-3-ser-omm-dmm-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shader Execution Reordering (SER)</a>. How much of a performance boost do you expect from those additions? Also, do you have an ETA on when they might be introduced to War Thunder?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, both are underway. For SER, we need to change our ray generation method, as to use it, there are some constraints, like you can’t use it in compute shaders. For OMM, we already have a working prototype, and while it doesn’t do wonders, it brings decent improvement in tracing performance, especially with areas with denser foliage. Microsoft recently made both of these features part of the core Direct3D system. We are still waiting for the final GPU drivers with support for these technologies. But by the time those arrive, we can probably finish the work on them in Dagor and War Thunder and release these features early next year.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about DirectX's Work Graphs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-cpu-bottlenecks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to developers a year and a half ago</a>)? Are they as important as Microsoft is claiming? Will you implement them for your engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> This is the long-awaited step to a more GPU-driven rendering pipeline. In some cases, it can provide significant GPU workload optimization and almost always free some CPU. Unfortunately, its benefits are only possible on rather new hardware. We do want to implement Work Graphs support as well in the upcoming years.</p>

<p><strong>Could PS5 Pro support some version of path tracing? Also, do you have any future improvements coming to the PS5 Pro version, and if so, which ones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</p>



<p><strong>Are you adding AMD FSR 4 support at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gergo Horvath:</strong> FSR4 is a high priority for us as it is an often-requested feature from players. We have had some divergence regarding upscaling and frame generation technologies supported by each of the games. Even though they are using the same engine. We had XeSS-FG and XeLL added to WT as well as AMD FSR3 with frame generation to War Thunder and now Enlisted is lagging behind. We are planning to remedy the situation by converging support of these technologies in all of our games by the end of the year, and AMD FSR4 will also be part of that package for PC. If and when FSR4 would be available for consoles we will already be ready.</p>



<p><strong>Will Enlisted also receive a PTGI update? If so, is there an ETA?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Yes, it is planned to have PTGI in Enlisted as well – internally, we do have a running version with it already. Although our current GI solution is giving very similar results to PTGI with significantly higher performance, it is always good to be able to compare to the “ground truth” solution. We aim to release it this year, though no hard deadline yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is out now, and it's being sold like hotcakes. Are you considering a Switch 2 port for War Thunder and/or Enlisted?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: From Best to Worst Deal in Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-from-best-to-worst-deal-in-gaming.1315942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year has not been kind to Xbox users as Microsoft continually finds new and creative ways to make their customers mad. Xbox's attempt to kill its own brand is making huge progress as they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">increased the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>&nbsp;by 50%. Amusingly enough, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike is being advertised as the "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow">most expansive upgrade yet, including more day one games than ever before.</a>"</p>

<p>For a service that was once considered the best deal in modern gaming history, the new $30 monthly bill borders on daylight robbery. For 1.5 times the previous price, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate would fundamentally function as it did before, with no particularly noteworthy added features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to retain the current cost of $20 per month, you'll have to settle for the Premium tier at $15.&nbsp;The Premium tier does not have day-one access to Xbox-published games, which may be withheld for up to a year after launch before it is added to the Game Pass library. You also lose out on EA Play, which was part of the $20 pricing of Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it seems as though a large number of third party games are being locked behind the Ultimate tier as well. The Xbox store page <em>for&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> for example <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9N116V0599HB" rel="nofollow">specifies that it is included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, whereas the store page for <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/9PHGQPRBBSXK" rel="nofollow">only mentions Game Pass Premium</a>. As it stands now, Xbox's Game Pass page lists 838 available games for Ultimate and 372 games available for Premium users. Whether or not this will change when the new subscription prices goes live remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: What's Cost-Benefit Analysis?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=giOGHC-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=QhMBYzEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Xbox should consider a custom plan instead where people can pick and choose what they want instead. Nah, that'd make way too much sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Xbox Game Pass' main selling point was that it was usually more cost efficient than buying a game. At $20, you get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for the price of a $60 game.&nbsp;Three months should be sufficient playtime for the average person to finish most full-priced games. They could then play one of the many other games in the Game Pass library, which might keep people in the ecosystem under the guise of affordability and convenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the new subscription prices, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will only offer two full months of value for the full cost of a AAA game. This is especially relevant now that $70 and $80 games are starting to enter the equation. Game Pass Ultimate would have remained competitive at $20 in such an environment. There is no scenario where $30 can be considered by most people.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, one month of the new Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs more than outright buying <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>At two months, you can get the Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur:&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em></a>. Of course, you can drop down to Premium tier for a better exchange rate, but you're giving up day-one access to first-party Xbox games for up to a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox is attempting to offset this by bundling&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics with Ultimate.&nbsp;The problem is that EA Play has been a part of Game Pass for years by now, and Ubisoft games were routinely being added to the Game Pass library regardless.</p>

<p>Logically, if people were that interested in EA or Ubisoft games they would've subscribed to their respective services already.&nbsp;Those who are long-term subscribers to Xbox Game Pass likely care more about first-party Xbox games, smaller third-party titles, and indie games since these games make up the majority of the Game Pass library.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Where're the Games, Phil?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=5MZIKik5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=-7oaUUEd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So, how's that Bethesda and Activsion Blizzard acquisition working out for ya, Xbox?</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, all these changes might end up decimating the player base of first-party Xbox games.&nbsp;Even the best games in the world are not worth the additional $15 monthly charge for the mere privilege of day one access. Most people would simply stick with Premium (if they remain subscribed at all) and then switch to Ultimate for a month or two if they really wanted to play a specific game that was not available on Premium. Or they could simply buy the game.</p>

<p>That's assuming that those first-party Xbox games are worth playing, or exist, to begin with. Despite spending a literal fortune on Bethesda and Activision Blizzard King, neither purchase has resulted in an increased variety of games for the end user, to say nothing of new IPs. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">news of workers being fired and game development studios being closed down</a> isn't exactly inspiring confidence in anyone.</p>

<p>One would almost think that Sony has someone feeding ideas to Xbox leadership because the changes to Game Pass Ultimate are absolutely incredible... for PlayStation. For starters, a monthly subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium is $18, while the current cost of a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is $20. The new Game Pass pricing scheme would put Ultimate at $30, a full 60% more than the comparable service offered by PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass only returns to a competitive price at the Premium level, but at that point Game Pass is ceding its massive advantage in library size and day-one access for a monthly discount of $3. If there was ever an attempt to position Xbox as the affordable way to game, then this Game Pass update just torpedoed those efforts in less than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Gearing Up for the Next Console War?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=WynVXDHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=4-lUgrTI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a bold strategy to make everything an Xbox, let's see if it pays out for them</figcaption></figure><p>Without the niche of offering a superior subscription service, it's hard to make a case for Xbox hardware. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xboxconsoles?icid=DSM_Gaming_Consoles_AllXboxConsoles_Slot01" rel="nofollow">2TB Xbox Series X is selling for $730</a>. Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console" rel="nofollow">2TB PS5 Pro goes for $750</a>. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally" rel="nofollow">ROG Xbox Ally is projected to sell for $600</a>. A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-system-123669/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 has a price tag of $450</a>&nbsp;by comparison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saving $20 on hardware between PlayStation and Xbox hardly counts for much if the monthly subscription costs for Ultimate are going to be $30. If Ultimate was $20 with all of its perks intact, then an argument for long-term affordability can be made, especially if individual games are $70 or $80.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Xbox does have a slight advantage over its competitors in that Xbox Game Pass has cloud-gaming functionality available for PCs, most modern phones, tablets, and some TVs.&nbsp;Ultimate users are apparently given priority access, though whether or not that's worth the added cost is up to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is to give up on consoles altogether and leapfrog the high cost associated with PC hardware via Xbox Game Pass' cloud gaming functionality. In theory this would make everything a potential Xbox and everyone a potential Xbox Game Pass subscriber. The PC and phones would thus become the next battleground, given that one or the other are almost mandatory to have in this day and age.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: A Lesson on How to Shoot Yourself in the Foot</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=5_9p_gRG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=Zipq8EeI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's kind of funny how Xbox keeps advertising in-game bonuses for otherwise free-to-play games as if they're a huge draw for Game Pass rather than just... bonuses.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if the strategy is to abandon traditional consoles and move Xbox into a multiplatform publishing role, no one on PC is going to spend the equivalent of four to six full-price AAA games on a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You can probably make a case for Premium, but it's going to be difficult when Xbox releases games on Steam anyways.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this seems to be the worst possible time for Xbox to agitate longtime fans of Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>&nbsp;are releasing within the next year, all games that could've otherwise boosted Game Pass numbers. Not to mention that Hideo Kojima's next (Xbox published, mind you) project, <em>OD</em>, finally got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">reveal trailer</a>.</p>

<p>The real victims in this whole fiasco would be the smaller or more obscure game developers who might've found new audiences thanks to Xbox Game Pass. Games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/trek-to-yomi" rel="nofollow"><em>Trek to Yomi</em></a>, and <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em> were excellent additions that fully deserved their spot in the Game Pass library, serving as fantastic examples of how a subscription service does have its use cases in the gaming industry.</p>

              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>
