            <p>Dambuster Studios are planning to keep their next truckload of undead penned in for a few more years, before opening the big zombie door in early 2028. That's according to some financial docs from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island">Dead Island</a> developers, in which their plans for Dead Island 3 as of the end of March this year are laid bare.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The docs, spotted by a Twitterer with the handle <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">@bogorad222</a>, are Dambuster's annual financial report for the fiscal year that ended on March 31st, 2025. As such, they contain many numbers, but also a section on the studio's current strategy.</p>
<p>Basically, the plan is to now go full steam ahead on Dead Island 3. All Dambuster’s developers are now working on Dead Island 3, to be joined by the studio's QA staff once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Luna and Mac versions are done and dusted. "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace," the report says of DA3, before whipping out that planned release window of some point in 2028's first two financial quarters.</p>
<p>Putting things into real human years, that window likely means the third zombpocalyspse will come by the end of June 2028, assuming things go to the current plan.</p>
<p>This the first concrete news we've gotten about Dead Island 3, unless you count Dambuster teasing it with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243?snr=2___">a Steam post</a> which mentioned they're "already carving out what comes next" back in September. At any rate, you've got plenty of time to read back over our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-island-2-review">Dead Island 2 review</a>, in which Rick Lane judged that while "not worth waiting eleven years for", it's "a breezy, messy adventure that has zero nutritional value, but will fill your bloodstream with yummy, delicious sugar."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-its-microsd-card-below-0-13-per-gb-for-holidays-the-cheapest-nintendo-switch-storage-upgrade-2000653790</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage issues are common, but also avoidable. If you’re running out of storage on your Nintendo Switch 2 and often find yourself deleting some titles to make room for new ones, investing in an SD card can be a smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 256GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card for just $33, after taking 40% off its usual $55 retail price</a>. Prime members get to enjoy free delivery, so they’re saving a few extra dollars on that front too. This is also the lowest we have seen this memory card drop to since its release, but as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. We suggest getting your orders in as soon as you can before the price shoots back up – which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting with the storage; you’re getting a nice 256GB of additional storage with this card, which translates into more space for the latest releases, updates, DLC, and even screenshots. You will be able to have all the titles you like installed and ready to go; no need to choose what to delete to make room for something new every few weeks. The capacity this version gets you should be enough for casual gamers who mostly play smaller indie titles. However, if you’re looking to download a bunch of large AAA games, you might want to consider grabbing the 512GB version, which is sitting at $100 at the time of writing. This will help you avoid the same old loop where you find yourself with limited storage every few weeks.</p>
<p>As for the performance, you’re looking at sequential read speeds up to 800 MB/s, which helps load games considerably faster than the brand’s standard microSD cards. That means spending less time on loading or updating, and quicker game launches. Despite the impressive capabilities, the card maintains an ideal temperature as it works, even during intense matches. That’s thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guards, which work tirelessly to keep the card from overheating while ensuring smooth performance.</p>



<p>Best of all, the card is made to work with Nintendo Switch 2, plus it plays nicely with a range of microSD UHS-I devices, including computers, handheld consoles, tablets, and even cameras. When using it with a camera, you can expect it to capture stunning 4K video and photos like a pro!</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 6-proof protection with a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase. It’s basically temperature, drop, magnet, water, X-ray, and wearout proof, which means you’ll enjoy consistent performance 24/7. Samsung Magician software helps you keep an eye on the health of the card and monitor performance with ease.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for an easy way of boosting the overall storage of your console while still enjoying good performance, this P9 Express microSD card can be a good addition to your setup.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/"> It normally goes for $55, which is already quite affordable considering all that you’re getting, but the current 40% discount makes it even more approachable.</a> And since it works with a range of devices, now is a great time to pick a couple of these for your cameras, tablet, or even laptop – without blowing your budget!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-to-receive-a-difficulty-adjustment">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to Receive a Difficulty Adjustment</h2>



<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>







<p>In other news, Tomb Raider: Catalyst will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require ‘no homework’</a> before jumping in. Additionally, the co-creator of the original game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prefers new chapters over remakes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been going from strength to strength this year.

<p>But, that number has since increased further, and according to <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics">Alinea Analytics, </a>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold "almost" 400k copies since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">its record-breaking Game Awards nominations</a> on 17th November. Meanwhile, the company's <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472/photo/1">head of market analysis Rhys Elliott</a> estimates Clair Obscur has "sold an extra 200k+ copies since" The Game Awards last week, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">scooped up the coveted Game of the Year accolade among others</a>.</p>

<p>To break that down further, Elliott said 76 percent of those sales were on Steam, with 21 percent on PS5 and three percent on Xbox. "Around 52 thousand Xbox players" have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">since played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 via Game Pass</a> "for the first time" as well, Elliott added.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received a notable uptake in player numbers since last week's award show, as you can see in the graph below.</p>
<p>The Sunday before this year's The Game Awards welcomed 22,759 Clair Obscur players on Steam, while the Sunday after saw 56,993 players. That's an increase of 34,234 players between those two specific days.</p>

<p>The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p>
<p>During the awards show last week, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> fans have discovered a load of unused conversations between the game's controversial NPCs.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games where Samus is mostly isolated and alone, the latest in the series sees Samus rescuing and interacting with an ensemble of Federation soldiers. This has proven unpopular with many players, who feel it undermines its otherwise mysterious tone.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Bearborg has uploaded a video of all base camp interactions in the game, including unused dialogue, which were taken from the game's files (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>). The video includes over 41 minutes of dialogue, of which around 34 minutes is unused.</p>

<p>As this extra dialogue was all recorded, it suggests the game originally had far more incidental conversations between its characters, which were (perhaps rightfully) paired back.</p>
<p>Cut conversations include discussions on how much robot VUE-995 can bench press, MacKenzie's lack of field experience, and Armstrong finding out about roast beasts, among many others. It's mostly more humorous dialogue that adds little to the story, which is likely why it was cut.</p>

<p>In the final version of the game, these characters are little more than broad, stereotypical sketches. Yet as Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson explained, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4 suffers more from Samus's own lack of dialogue by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>"It's presentationally clear here that Samus just isn't talking," he wrote. "The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it sucks."</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 was eagerly awaited for 18 years until its release earlier this month. Unfortunately, for many it has not lived up to expectations.</p>
<p>"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Narrative]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/game-of-the-year-2025-best-narrative/</link>
            <guid>1384456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Why do we love games? The enjoyment is more than just the bright screens and the action taking place, thought that is usually a big part of it. Another is the story and narrative of games, which can go in all sorts of directions and be told in ways that are very different to books, film, or theatre. Many of the most lauded games are celebrated not just because of gameplay, but for the tales of their characters and the narrative we experience alongside them, the ones that draw us in until we’re eagerly reading messages sent between coworkers while hacking their computers. Which brings us nicely to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game=of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> Best Narrative standouts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">Hundred Line Last Defense Academy</a> is our winner of Best Narrative, or should that be Best <em>Narratives</em>? A story of 15 students having to survive 100 days while holding back monsters, and dealing with the different relationships between the characters while they fight to survive. It is a mammoth game with players able to work towards a staggering 100 different endings. Putting together one narrative is tough enough for most games, so doing it 100 times over and tying those into every single choice you make is work that should be rewarded.</p>


<p>I’m going to quote Miguel here who summed up Hundred Line Last Defense Academy by saying, “It’s this beautifully overwhelming web of stories and paths and branching events where, like, two people can spend dozens of hours playing the game and never have the same experience, or you can just pick it up any time and discover a new story and a new ending. It’s such an insane achievement.”</p>
<h3>Dispatch – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The expectations for Dispatch were high, just from knowing that it was coming from a team that had previously worked on Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Where would they take their episodic storytelling next? Perhaps to offer a fresh perspective on the superhero genre,&nbsp;while also tapping into and succeeding at creating a heartfelt and funny adventure.</p>

<p>You are Robert Robertson, previously known as the hero Mecha Man, who after losing to his nemesis is taken off hero duties and becomes a superhero dispatcher instead, swapping punches for office politics. Office politics are tough enough to deal with, but even more so in Dispatch as you work with ex-supervillains to put them on the path of good. It is also a narrative the explores the themes of identity and learning about who you are as person, while dealing with problems from small issues in the office to life threatening ones that pile on the pressure. Dispatch is a game whose narrative is going to be remembered for a long time.</p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Death is hard enough to deal with as it is when it comes for a loved one. The confusion, the grief, the anger, the reflection, and finally the acceptance are all parts of the journey when it comes. But what if you knew when death was coming for you, and not just you but everyone the same age as you? That is the story Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, where a group of people head out to end the Paintress before she paints the number 33 and wipes out anyone of that age.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a strong story supported by a cast of characters that are memorable, leading to you wanting to spend time with them. Behind it all though is the worry that the Expedition, like so many others before, will fail and the Paintress will live to come after the next age the following year. Alongside that fear and worry are moments of joy and wonder, with the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 providing a stunning playground in which to enjoy the expansive story that has touched so many this year and will do so for years to come. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not just a game for RPG fans, it is a game for those who love everything about stories.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/553509792472105640?l=english">Early access update five</a> rings in an early Christmas by initiating the minivan era of BugBear's banger basher - that's an MPV if you want to be boring or a people carrier if you're from the good old U of K. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> family bus is dubbed the Grandstar, and it's glorious. Room for seven seats amongst the roll-cage, ample crumple zones between you and the thing you're hitting, and probably a baby seat you want to bring your toddler along.</p>
<p>Aside from the motorhome, which isn't really a daily driver, Wreckfest 2's car list so far has lacked a beefy family wagon to battle the array of muscle cars, saloons, and hatchbacks. As someone who loved the original's Warwagon, Hammerhead, and Hearse, I can assure you that's a good thing. If you're into racing cars that don't resemble bricks, first of all boooooooooooooooo. Second of all, this update's also added in a zippy couple called the Phaser.</p><p>There's a new track dubbed Moorfield, which boasts two muddy race and crash-oriented routes through a farm field that's been pre-ground into a wet and muddy pulp to show off the muddying and tyre sinkage mechanics BugBear have added to every ride. Crashing itself's had a major revamp with this update, with the devs explaining:</p>
<blockquote>In a game like ours, crashing into others should be rewarded. Yet, previously the outcome could feel a bit arbitrary as there were situations in which you were confident you were going to score a good hit on your opponent, only to receive more damage yourself. In this update, we've refactored the attacker/defender detection to make sure we correctly interpret who is the attacker and who is the defender. We've also improved the gameplay logic that determines the outcome of the crash to reward aggressive playing. The gist of the changes is that, like previously, the damage calculations now favour the car with more mass and speed (just more reliably), but when using the normal damage mode the condition of the car is also taken into account.</blockquote>
<p>Rounding things out are the likes of handy tweaks that'll make the livery editor added in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/your-wreckfest-2-ride-merely-adopted-the-rust-and-dents-mine-had-its-scuffage-moulded-by-the-new-crap-it-tool">last month's update</a> easier to use. There are new decals, and you can mirror on different sides of your car or edit them as a group with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Now, I'd better wrap this up and get to wrecking so I can deposit the youngins in good time.</p>

              <p><span>If you were to ask Sony executives about PlayStation’s 2025, they’d probably tell you it was great. According to the company, the PS5 is already its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168"><span>“most successful” console generation</span></a><span> after only five years. Thanks to all the money Sony’s made through microtransactions and subscription services like PlayStation Plus, the system the internet claims has </span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ps5-has-no-games"><span>“no games”</span></a><span> is eclipsing its predecessors (as long as you don’t adjust for inflation), and it presumably still has a few years left in it. But does Sony actually have anything to show for it in year five?</span></p> <p><span>While it’s beating out previous PlayStations in terms of revenue and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264"><span>hardware sales have been staggering</span></a><span>, the PlayStation 5’s lifespan has also been defined by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>live-service flops</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547"><span>studio closures</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-ii-2-remastered-ps5-ps4-remake-too-soon-1851042718"><span>time-biding remasters</span></a><span>. Throughout the PS5 era, Sony has been devouring money, but hasn’t been offering the kinds of big (and small) exclusives defined by identifiable characters, experiences, and stories that were once synonymous with the brand.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2024, the PS5 seemed like a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><span>cultural black hole</span></a><span> despite its success. Did 2025 get things back on the right track? Or was it just another year of Sony’s misguided pivots away from what made PlayStation more than just the box on which you play the games that don’t run well on Switch?</span></p>

 <h2><b>The hardware</b></h2> <p><span>While the PlayStation 5 is still a raging success for Sony, it, like most other video game hardware, was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>hit with a price hike</span></a><span>. This followed the Trump administration’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765"><span>new tariffs</span></a><span> (though the device’s price was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-digital-edition-price-increase-uk-europe-tariffs-1851776054"><span>raised in other territories</span></a><span> outside of America, as well), which also caused Xbox to raise its prices and seemingly affected the Switch 2’s debut MSRP in June. Now the system will run you an extra $50, regardless of which SKU you buy. The standard edition costs $549.99, while the digital edition without a disc drive now costs as much as the disc-drive version did in 2020 at $499.99. The PlayStation 5 Pro, meanwhile, has been raised to a whopping $749.99, which is a hefty asking price for something that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988"><span>hasn’t made much of an impact</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000648497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000648497"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000648497">© Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Historically, console prices are supposed to go down as a generation goes on. Sony has already said that the PS5 is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-life-cycle-generation-sony-1851257227"><span>entering the “later stages of its life,</span></a><span>” and the PS6 is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303"><span>supposedly on the way</span></a><span>. But even as the PS5 enters its twilight years, it’s more expensive than ever. The only time you probably would’ve paid more for the thing is when it was scarce and scalpers were reselling it. (A cheaper model was also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>released in Japan earlier this year</span></a><span>, but it’s region-locked.)</span></p>

 <p><span>The PS5 may have gone up in price, but one of its peripherals went down and stayed there. The PlayStation VR2’s $550 price tag </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psvr2-price-discount-cheap-hitman-playstation-ps5-1851766790"><span>nosedived to $400 in February</span></a><span> following reports that Sony had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240"><span>halted manufacturing</span></a><span> the headset as it struggled to meet its original projections. This makes it not unsurprising that Sony itself didn’t do much to support the PSVR2 in 2025. A few notable third-party projects like </span><i><span>Lumines Arise</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Alien Rogue Incursion</span></i><span> kept the VR sickos fed, but Sony didn’t do much of note with the thing in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Also on the hardware side, Sony is finally making the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770"><span>PlayStation Portal</span></a><span> what it always should have been. The streaming handheld was previously a Remote Play machine that let you stream your PS5 to it, but now the device </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update-ps5-patch-2000641330"><span>can stream games</span></a><span> directly from the cloud, rather than bouncing them off another system.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The software</b></h2> <p><span>Broadly speaking, booting up a PS5 hasn’t changed much in 2025. Yeah, Sony brought back a few </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-update-new-april-24-retro-ps2-ps3-theme-sound-focus-1851777579"><span>dynamic themes</span></a><span> after previously making them a limited-time flourish, but beyond that, </span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/"><span>scrolling through the system’s 2025 system software patch notes</span></a><span> shows a lot of small quality-of-life changes, a few accessibility updates like the addition of an audio focus option to make soft sounds come through on headphones more clearly, and more customization options for the main menu UI. There’s a lot for audiophiles to chew on, but overall, the PS5 user experience is in a pretty alright place. Don’t fix what ain’t broke.</span></p> <h2><b>The services</b></h2> <p><span>The PS5’s price wasn’t the only one Sony raised this year. The cost of PlayStation Plus, the subscription service that lets users play online, add free monthly games to their collection, and stream a huge library of older titles at higher tiers, was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655"><span>also hiked in April in multiple countries</span></a><span>, and Sony is </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-says-it-will-continue-to-adjust-ps-plus-pricing-as-more-players-choose-higher-tiers/"><span>open to doing it again</span></a><span>. This </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462"><span>wasn’t the first time Sony’s done this in the PS5 era</span></a><span>, either. It feels like as more people are putting time into free-to-play games, Sony is looking for different ways to squeeze some juice out of them through subscriptions and microtransactions.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645472"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645472">© Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The games</b></h2> <p><span>But none of the above matters if the games aren’t there. The PlayStation 5 has ingrained itself so completely into the public consciousness as the de facto video game console on your TV that Xbox won’t tell us its sales numbers anymore. As a result of its market domination, the success of any PS5 game can be considered a PS5 win by association. Huge breakthrough games like </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>don’t even have to be Sony games for the PS5 maker to benefit. </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>can continue to scrape in </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fortnites-hold-on-revenue-and-maus-remains-in-july-2025-newzoo-charts"><span>billions in revenue</span></a><span> and if those microtransactions happen through the PlayStation Store, Sony’s getting a cut. So what is Sony actually doing with the hypothetical freedom you get from being top dog? In 2025, not a lot.</span></p>

 <p><span>Continuing a grim trend from recent years, Sony studios in 2025 were repeatedly hit by layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264"><span>after live-service projects failed to take off</span></a><span>. And yet, PlayStation higher-ups continue to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-concord-marathon-smoothly-2000616270"><span>insist that this is the way forward</span></a><span> for the company that was once defined by more than a desperate need to hook someone into dailies and microtransactions. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><i><span>Marathon </span></i><span>was delayed even as </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>is struggling</span></a><span>, so the major PlayStation pillars this year were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i></a><span>, which will eventually go to other platforms, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-september-2025-sales-borderlands-4-final-fantasy-tactics-2000638319"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a><span>, which, despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>manufactured controversy</span></a><span>, has sold millions of copies and is a GOTY season darling.</span></p> <p><span>So yeah, the PlayStation 5 has had a good year on paper, but how much of that is actually the result of Sony’s own legwork? When all is said and done, I’m sure the company will have a wonderful earnings report after the fiscal year is over, and it will have no reason to learn anything from its failed projects and fired workers.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem with Sony’s nearly monopolistic hold on the AAA console market this generation is that PlayStation, as a brand, has become so ubiquitous that it doesn’t need an identity anymore. Incredible games make their way to the PlayStation 5 more than any other console, whether that be because the Switch 2 can’t run them well or because developers </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm24PAjAbBc"><span>decide that releasing on Xbox, with its smaller attachment rate, isn’t worth the risky investment</span></a><span>. So yeah, PlayStation has “won” the imagined console war, and now its internal line-up doesn’t have to stand out the way it once did. The company can just release a big AAA-ass video game every once in a while and get major awards buzz. Most of PlayStation’s output in recent years has felt influenced by prestige television, with cinematic games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> becoming the video game equivalent of Oscar bait, lapping up praise and acclaim every year. Those games are, perhaps, the final echoes of the time when PlayStation was moving artistic mountains, but nowadays, they feel like they exist largely to prop up an assembly line of failed live-service efforts, and none of the smaller, quirkier, or more low-stakes experiences that once made PlayStation’s catalog the most diverse of all the console makers’ are anywhere to be found.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000283254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000283254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000283254">© HBO</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Last year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a> <span>was released, a celebration of PlayStation history that was conspicuously lacking in characters and references to PlayStation 5 games. If that game had launched in 2025 instead, I don’t think that would have changed. The PS5 has been a huge financial success for Sony, so it doesn’t really have to be anything else in the eyes of those who are making the big decisions. PlayStation has always been a business, but now the people who used to come out on stage at events like E3 and pitch people on a specific, defined experience that PlayStation could offer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-shawn-layden-live-service-sony-last-us-online-1851772581"><span>have mostly left the company</span></a><span> as it has abandoned passion projects like </span><i><span>Gravity Rush</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Dreams</span></i><span>,</span> <span>and </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>to try (and repeatedly fail) to enter the live-service rat race. Even the games that were once some of the brand’s strongest artistic statements </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661"><span>will be bled dry</span></a><span> until whatever integrity those works once had is just a distant memory.</span></p> <p><span>We’re five years into the PS5 generation, and despite it being the “most successful” console ever in Sony’s line-up, the company has remarkably little cultural cache to show for it beyond the PS5’s name becoming the video game equivalent of everyone calling a bandage a “Band-Aid.” And hey, it looks like you can iron out all those wrinkles, quirks, and charms and still make it to the top of the video game food chain. In two generations on top, PlayStation has achieved the kind of ubiquity the Sony higher-ups probably wanted, and all it cost the brand was its soul.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-final-playstation-vr2-clearance-for-holidays-last-units-are-hitting-their-lowest-price-ever-2000653520</link>
            <guid>1384447</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Still looking for the right gaming-oriented gift this holiday season? While we’re start off the final weeks of December, some retailers are reinitiating Black Friday-level discounts to aid with your holiday shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/">One of the standout deals at Amazon is for the PlayStation VR2, which is now priced at just $299, down from its usual $400.</a> This discount of $101 makes it an excellent holiday gift option.</p>
<p data-start="382" data-end="692">For many, the price of virtual reality headsets like the PlayStation VR2 can prove quite the barrier to entry. However, with the PSVR2 now at its lowest price ever, it’s an ideal time to jump in. This deal slashes the cost a full quarter of its retail price, making it a lot more tempting.</p>
<p data-start="694" data-end="1154">The PSVR2 packs some impressive features, borrowing from the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. It also includes finger touch detection, eye tracking, 3D audio, and headset feedback for a fully immersive experience. The headset boasts aa 110° field of view on its 4K HDR display that runs at 120fps, thanks to two OLED screens with 2000 x 2040 resolution each—four times the resolution of the original PlayStation VR.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1156" data-end="1477">One of the standout features of the PSVR2 is the 3D audio, which enhances the feeling of being inside the game. You’ll be able to hear every whisper in your ear, pinpoint the location of enemies or allies by the sound of their footsteps or gunshots, and experience a soundscape that adapts to your movements and position.</p>
<p data-start="1479" data-end="1696">To use the PSVR2, you simply connect it to your PlayStation 5 console, making setup easy. It’s not limited to VR games either; you can also enjoy non-VR content in Cinematic Mode, adding even more value to the device.</p>


<h2 data-start="1479" data-end="1696">What to Play</h2>
<p>If you’re a fan of the Horizon series with&nbsp;<em>Horizon: Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>and <em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em>, then you’ll want to experience the complete saga as its stands now with&nbsp;<em>Horizon: Call of the Mountain</em>—a title exclusive to PSVR2. Take on a first person perspective as you explore the stunning vistas of this world through the eyes of a new character, Ryas. Scale large cliffs with your pickaxes and take down large enemies by really drawing back a bow.</p>
<p>There are also some awesome multiplatform VR titles that have found another home on PSVR2. The rhythm game Beat Saber is the must-own titles for anyone with a virtual reality headset, and&nbsp;<em>Superhot</em> is still an unbeatable experience that uses the medium at its full capacity.</p>
<p data-start="1698" data-end="1990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been waiting for the perfect time to grab a PlayStation VR2, now’s your chance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/">The $299 price tag at Amazon means you’re saving $101, but keep in mind that you’ll need a PS5 to use it.</a> It’s a great deal for anyone looking to dive into the world of VR gaming this holiday season.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d9d7f196e5e75"><a title="TOTK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9d7f196e5e75/totk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Monolith Soft, the acclaimed developer behind the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> series, is also known to have collaborated with Nintendo on a number of first-party games, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worked closely with Nintendo on the Zelda series, starting with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword">Skyward Sword</a> in 2011. Now, the company has released <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html">a new interview</a> to celebrate its work on Zelda so far. Participants include Yasuhiro Fujita from Monolith Soft and Daiki Iwamoto from Nintendo, with the pair discussing how Monolith came to be involved with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The interview is only available in Japanese for the time being, but machine translation has at least been able to provide <em>some</em> idea of which subjects were up for discussion. One highlight includes how the team at Monolith felt a degree of anxiety at working on a Nintendo title with Skyward Sword, with both parties gaining more and more confidence with each successful project.</p>
<p>With Tears of the Kingdom, Monolith became involved from the early stages of development, with team members from Nintendo visiting the studio frequently to discuss ideas.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's clear that Monolith Soft has become an integral part of Nintendo's development structure. The team will no doubt continue to produce new entries in the Xenoblade Chronicles series going forward, but it'll be interesting to see just how involved it will be in new Zelda titles, too.</p>
<p>Iwamoto-san specifically states "I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch" at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>Could we possibly see a Zelda title developed solely by Monolith in the future..? Gosh, that's an exciting prospect.</p>

              <p>It still feels odd to live in a post-<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> reality. The game was ephemeral for so many years that it feels almost crass for it to have been released three months ago. It probably helps that it’s been <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hollow-knight-silksong/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">rapturously received</a>—among <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568">more nuanced criticism</a>—and there’s now more good news: somehow, improbably, Team Cherry is well on its way to releasing a <em>free </em>expansion due in 2026. That accompanies the excellent news that those who bought the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;for Switch will soon be entitled to a free upgrade to a refreshed version for Switch 2.</p> <p>The enigmatically quiet Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">posted an update to its hilariously infrequently updated blog</a>, detailing the news, but also making clear the small team’s delight at the success of the game’s release. Stating that <strong>over seven million people</strong> have bought the game so far (does quick math, takes off 30 percent for store tithes…that’s $98 million!), Team Cherry says “your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.”</p>   <p>This leads us to the freshly announced expansion,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Sorrow</em>. There’s a teaser trailer, but don’t expect to get anything from it.</p>

  <p>Well that could have been a text message. <em>Sea of Sorrow</em> will have new areas (seemingly wetter than most), bosses and tools, in an expansion that will be completely free when it releases—Team Cherry claims—next year. But seriously? Anyone believe that? Come on. 2027 at the earliest, <em>for sure</em>. Actual information about the DLC, beyond that it has a nautical setting, will be held until “shortly before” the expansion is out, so expect more self-imposed silence from the developers, and then presumably a reply on the Discord when it slips.</p>

 <p>It’s all good, though! Of course they should take their time. It’s a passion project, no one’s entitled to it by a certain date, and it’s being given away for free. Plus they just made $100,000,000—why is any of them even acknowledging the existence of game development right now?</p>

 <p>Yet, still Team Cherry works, leading to even more generous news that there’s to be a Switch 2 refresh of the original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and that too will be given to owners of the original Switch version for free! This will add improved framerates, a higher resolution, and a bunch of graphical effects that appeared in&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>. If you want a sneak peak of that updated goodness, you can jump into the beta branches on Steam or GOG, which include 21:9 support for ultrawide sickos.</p> <p>There are claims that there are even more plans for 2026, which are currently secret, but also word that Team Cherry’s games will be on sale across various stores over the holiday season. Given&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was already only $20, that could mean some proper bargains.</p>

              <p>It’s not every day Amazon lets you pick a highly-rated laptop for less. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your everyday office/study machine but the scary price tags have been holding you back, the retailer is making it incredibly easy to grab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6417/">We’re spotting plenty of solid deals across a range of models like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and more, but one of our favorite offers is the 72% discount on the HP 15.6-inch touchscreen business lapto</a>p. You’re saving a whopping $1,720 on this highly-rated model and getting some useful computer accessories for free, but the deal is only around for today. It wraps up at midnight, so it’s best to bag the drop as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6417/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Visuals on the Touchscreen</h2>
<p>In a portable build, you’re getting an impressive 15.6-inch FHD IPS touchscreen that delivers brilliant, sharp visuals. You’ll enjoy vibrant colors and sharp details for all your favorite TV shows and movies, plus be able to read text better. The 178-degree wide viewing angle offers consistent visuals from all sides, while the micro-edge design offers larger screen real estate to work on. Touch support takes the experience a bit further by letting you use your fingers directly on the screen to perform a bunch of tasks. You’d be able to scroll through long documents without relying on the trackpad, swipe through images, browse, sketch, and even type. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back like a 2-in-1, so this thing won’t convert into a tablet for an only-screen experience, but the touch support still comes in handy, especially when you don’t want to bother with the mouse or the keys.</p>



<p>There’s an HD camera right above the display, which is paired with AI noise reduction. Both of these come together to make your video calls better; you will look good, and sound just as great. The battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of usage, which means you can go an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging is just as quick. HP Fast Charge juices your laptop from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. You can plug it in during lunch break and come back to a machine that’s ready to go.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop features an 8-core Intel Core i3-N305 processor. It works with 16GB of RAM to deliver the performance you need for your everyday tasks, plus some demanding projects. There’s a built-in 1TB SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your important files and documents without feeling limited, plus delivers fast boot/load times.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed. Other freebies include a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, and a screen wipe. Together, these cost around $200, but you’re getting the kit here for absolutely nothing. That said, the discount is only around for a few more hours, and the stock could sell out before the offer ends. Grab it before that happens!</p>

			<p>Almost five years after its debut on PlayStation 5, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</a></strong> is finally hitting other consoles next month with a release on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing more users to enjoy the first entry in the trilogy. Ahead of the new ports release, Square Enix has released a playable demo today, which also serves as yet another great showcase of what the Nintendo Switch 2 can do with dedicated optimization taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.</p>



<p>The demo allows players to experience the iconic bombing mission, accompanying Cloud Strife and Barret Wallace as they set out to destroy one of the Mako reactors powering the city of Midgar, ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company. Any progress made in the demo on both <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/it-IT/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fit-IT%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo%2F9NFTWDJKGSBF&amp;prompt=none">Xbox Series X|S</a></strong> can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, and all those importing a demo save file can claim the bonus items <em>"Revival Earrings"</em> and <em>"Survival Set"</em>.</p>

<p>With so many multiplatform games targeting both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there's little doubt that Microsoft's consoles should be able to handle Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade well. As such, there's obviously more curiosity surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 version, and the demo confirms that the new generation Nintendo console will deliver a more than playable experience, featuring great image quality that's almost on par with the PlayStation 5 release, judging from the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976008"><strong>first screenshots</strong></a> shared on <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976341">ResetERA</a></strong> by user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/often-ignored-bear.51892/"><strong>Often Ignored Bear</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With such outstanding image quality on display, the community consensus on this port is unanimous. "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Played through it just now in handheld. This looks nearly identical to how Intergrade looks on a base PS5 in Quality Mode. The hair has some dithering at times but looks fine overall. This is an INCREDIBLE port," </em>said ResetERA forums member <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148978135">Neiteio</a></strong>, echoing a widespread sentiment among fans.</p>



<p>The launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S will mark the beginning of a year very likely filled with Final Fantasy VII news. According to director Naoki Hamaguchi, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a name for the final entry in the trilogy will be decided before the end of the year</strong></a>, suggesting that the game's first reveal has a very high chance of happening in 2026. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-2028/</link>
            <guid>1384408</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In its new financial report, UK-based Dambuster Studios has reported that it is aiming to release Dead Island 3 by Q1/Q2 2028 (April – October 2028).</p>







<p><span>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history/MzQ5NDAyNTM3OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>&nbsp;(thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank">Timur222</a>), it says that the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3, a</span>nd all developers, who currently consist of 194 employees, will be assigned to the project once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete.</p>



<p>“Parts of the game [Dead Island 3] are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace,” says the report.</p>



<p>The release date suggests that the game will release for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC, and the next-generation of consoles, which are currently forecasted to release by the end fof 2028.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-island-3-new-location">Dead Island 3 New Location</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-20-million-players-dead-island-3-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Dead Island 3 as they celebrated the second installment reaching 20 million players (including those who played through subscription services and even those who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed it for free from the Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a> earlier this year).</p>



<p>Now, though, Internet spotter extraordinarie Timur222 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered</a> from Dambuster's financial statements that the UK studio is targeting Q1 or Q2 2028 as the launch window for Dead Island 3. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Dambuster Studios is a AAA video game developer based in Nottingham which has 194 employees (as of March 2025). 93% are working in development and the remaining staff are studio management and administrative support. After the release of Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3. All developers are assigned to the project, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete, all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3. Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028.</em></p>



<p>Dead Island 2 launched on April 21, 2023, which means that Dead Island 3 will be out in less than five years, provided there are no delays on the schedule.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 took a long time to be released. It was first in development by Yager, which showcased the game with a playable demo at Gamescom 2014. However, publisher Deep Silver was not satisfied with the developers' direction for the project and removed Yager from it. In March 2016, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Sumo Digital would make the game. Three and a half years later, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned</a> to Dambuster Studios, an internal Deep Silver studio.</p>



<p>With so many developer changes, there was widespread skepticism about the final game's quality, but Dambuster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a fun experience</a> that resonated with fans, convincing Deep Silver to assign Dead Island 3 as the studio's next project.</p>

Kennedy will return as the game’s second playable protagonist. Although he has aged a bit since we last saw him, Japanese fans have been taking to social media to praise Leon’s suave, older look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Slated for a multiplatform release on February 27, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline title in Capcom’s survival horror series. It will introduce new main character Grace Ashcroft, an FBI analyst who is investigating a series of mysterious deaths that seem to be linked to Victor Gideon, a former Umbrella Corp. researcher. While it seems that Grace’s parts of the game will play more like typical survival horror, the new trailer, below, gave fans a peek at Leon’s more action-orientated zombie-battling gameplay, complete with chainsaw. “Grace’s gameplay style is based on Resident Evil 2, whereas Leon’s is based on Resident Evil 4,” director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed in a recent interview with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Denfaminicogamer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Leon has always had his fans, the D.S.O agent’s middle-aged incarnation is getting much praise from Japanese speaking users on X. He’s already being affectionately called <em>ikeoji </em>(literally, “hot uncle” — a cool and attractive older guy). “Leon’s gradually becoming a hot uncle” one <a href="https://x.com/haniwa_yukkuri/status/1999433332824961140?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> mused.

He’s 49 in this (as of 2026)?

            <guid>1384381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">We have new official information on Dead Island 3, which is not only now confirmed to be in development, but has a target release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a financial report spotted by X / Twitter user @bogorad222, the Plaion-owned UK developer Dambuster Studios said its primary focus is now Dead Island 3. This is the first time we’ve heard Dead Island 3 mentioned in any official capacity, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-next-outbreak-is-already-brewing-it-looks-like-weve-got-our-first-dead-island-3-tease">the studio had teased it earlier this year</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Dambuster Studios' financial statements are out (as of March 2025)<br>The company employed 194 employees<br>Dead Island 3 is in development<br>The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028 <a href="https://t.co/FOHOitH3nD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/FOHOitH3nD</a></p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The report mentions that all Dambuster’s developers are now on Dead Island 3, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete all of Dambuster's QA team will also move over to Dead Island 3. As of the end of March 2025, Dambuster had 194 employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace,” the report continues. And here’s where things get really interesting: we even have a “current predicted release window” of Q1/2 2028. So, as things stand, Dead Island 3 is due out by the end of June 2028.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The existence of Dead Island 3 shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. In September, Dambuster posted the image, below, alongside the caption: “and the next outbreak is already brewing.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/16/080bf1e43f9ba2fbaa205d74e2bc142a82a22810-1757436135047-1765877525023.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dead Island 3 is coming.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi,” the message continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next. For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Based on the image, we can safely say Dead Island 3 will be set somewhere other than LA, which stands to reason. But where? Given the person shown in the image is hitching a ride, perhaps Vegas is a natural stopping off point. But really, it could be anywhere. After all, the first Dead Island was set on a fictional island chain in Oceania.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Dead Island 3 does come out the first half of 2028, it’ll arrive five years after Dead Island 2, which itself suffered long periods of development hell before eventually enjoying significant success. Dead Island 2 was revealed at E3 2014 but soon went quiet before "mutual differences" separated Yager from Deep Silver. It was then moved to Sumo Digital before being shifted again in 2019 to its final home of Dambuster Studios. A new trailer and gameplay video was released on December 6, 2022, during a Dead Island 2 showcase that announced it was delayed once again, slipping 12 weeks to April 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, when will we get our first look at Dead Island 3? Perhaps 2026 will bring a teaser trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Two more actors have been cast in Netflix's upcoming Assassin's Creed adaptation, which is based on Ubisoft's games of the same name.</p>
<p>Lola Petticrew (pictured below), who is known for Bloodlands and Trespasses, and Zachary Hart (pictured above) have both joined the show, though their characters at this time are being kept under wraps. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/assassins-creed-zachary-hart-netflix-live-action-series-1236647717/">Deadline</a>, Hart - whose previous credits include Slow Horses - will be a series regular.</p>

<p>The duo will be joining previously announced cast member Toby Wallace, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-adaptation-lands-first-lead-cast-member-in-euphoria-and-eden-actor">with the Eden actor set to play a co-lead in Netflix's Assassin's Creed series</a>.</p>
<p>While characters in the upcoming series are still unknown, it was previously said they will be different from the games. A report last month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-assassins-creed-show-will-be-set-in-ancient-rome">claimed the TV show will explore a time period hitherto untouched by Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed series</a>, and include figures from Ancient Rome such as Emperor Nero and Seneca the Younger.</p><p>Netflix's Assassin's Creed adaptation has been a long time coming, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-announces-assassins-creed-live-action-series">was first announced in 2020</a>. The series is being helmed by Roberto Patino (DMZ, Westworld, Sons of Anarchy) and David Wiener (Halo, Homecoming, The Killing), who will serve as creators, showrunners, and executive producers on the show. Filming is expected to take place in Italy next year.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, it really is just a case of when and not if Ubisoft will announce a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry Black Flag. Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">a myriad of leaks and rumours</a>, earlier this month a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">listing for Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced was spotted on the PEGI ratings board website</a>, further confirming its existence.</p>

			<p>You’ve almost certainly heard of Sherlock Holmes, Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, and chances are you’ve also heard of Inspector Morse, Sam Spade and Nancy Drew. Or my personal favourite, Inspector Barnaby&nbsp; – Tom, not John – though I’m not going to get picky if it means that more murders are committed in Midsomer soon. I’m looking at you ITV.</p>
<p>But I digress. There’s one thing that all these names have in common. They’re all super sleuths. Outstanding fictional detectives with household names that crime-solved their ways into our hearts with their lovable quirks and magnificently calculating brain-boxes.</p>
<p>And the latest investigator vying to add his name to the list? John Morley, a gritty 1940’s private detective, probing the facts of a case to end all cases in the aptly named video game, The Last Case of John Morley. But will Mr Morley’s name be entered into the fictional sleuth hall of fame?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Case of John Morley - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XncKeNsBgmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the start of the game, we meet John Morley in a hospital bed recovering from a previous case that nearly killed him. Returning to his office, he meets with a new client, an old lady who offers him a big wad of cash to solve a cold case; the murder of her daughter two decades ago. And so off Morley pops to a creepy old manor house to do some investigating.</p>

<p>There’s no mistaking that The Last Case of John Morley has a brilliant and intriguing story to tell. There were a few jump scares that, although heavily signposted, managed to go some way to construct a suspenseful horror atmosphere, and as the narrative unfolds the player will be treated to some enjoyably surprising plot twists. If you’re a fan of a good mystery storyline, you will be more than satisfied with how the plot unfolds. Sadly, the whole tale is – ironically – let down by the video game medium through which it has been told. For me, the game mechanics, low-quality visuals and character work all got in the way of the storytelling.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with the game mechanics. As you guide John Morley through a variety of different rooms, you’ll be prompted to select certain highlighted items of evidence that will be followed by a sentence or two of dialogue from Morley. &nbsp;The problem arises when the game stops you from progressing until you have selected every single item of evidence available in the room, right down to the last splatter of blood. You may think this a good thing. Surely, this means you’re unlikely to miss out on any evidence relevant to solving the case? Not quite.</p>
<p>Despite appearances, The Last Case of John Morley isn’t actually a detective game. It’s more of an interactive walk-through of a mystery story. There are none of the typical game mechanics that you’d expect to find in a detective game – organising and linking evidence, deciphering clues, choosing where to go or who to interrogate next – instead, John Morley does everything for you. You’re just along for the ride. And to point and click. As you can imagine, this quickly becomes overly restrictive, time-consuming and worst of all, boring.</p>

<p>Then there’s the clunky visuals. These are particularly grating in the sections where you talk to characters face-to-face. Interrogating witnesses is equal parts terrifying and painful to watch. Their wide eyes stare, unblinking, through the screen, their faces blank and unmoving except for their bottom lip that bobs up and down like a puppet in an attempt to match the words being said. How can you tell if a character is lying if they always have the same vacant look on their face? If you want the player to connect with the emotions of the story, facial expressions need to be the priority.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re hoping that the voice-over work might save the day. Inject a bit of energy and atmosphere into proceedings. Unfortunately, it doesn’t. The voiceover work is some of the worst I’ve heard. I felt I could have produced a less-wooden performance from my satnav. This is such a shame because the dialogue in the script is actually really great! The performances sap any atmosphere out of proceedings and will leave you wondering whether AI actors would actually be so bad after all. And the worst part? You can’t even skip ahead. There’s no reading the subtitles then hitting “next” to minimise your suffering. Plus, you have to ask every question available to you. You have to listen to it all. Every. Last. Wooden. Word.</p>

<p>All in all, The Last Case of John Morley has a storyline that you’ll want to inhale in one sitting. If you could read it in a book. Not play it as a video game.</p>

		The Last Case of John Morley is a detective game without any detecting. This walk-through of what could be a fantastic mystery story is let down by wooden voiceover performances, dated character visuals and mind-numbing mechanics.	</p></div>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> art director Robert Sammelin has shone some light on the inner workings of the extraction shooter's matchmaking system, confirming that player behaviour is indeed a factor in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/">Speaking to PC Gamer at The Game Awards</a>, Sammelin stated: "Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We analyse behaviour and match accordingly." When asked if he was able to elaborate on the matter, Sammelin said "no" and laughed.</p>
<p>Instead, the interview shifts to the topic of player passivity in general, and how the team at Embark has been able to see it in data gathered from Arc Raiders matches. Sammelin explained: "We got some figures on how many people have even downed another player, and they were surprisingly low at a large scale. There's also quite a difference in playing with a squad or solo with this, [which] opens up a very different experience depending on how you choose to engage with the game from the get-go.</p>

<p>"Of course data is great, the amount of data we get from telemetry is really helpful in finding out what we should be addressing, tweaking, or tuning. Pairing it up with internal assumptions is invaluable in terms of tuning and balance. That's something we'll keep doing continuously."</p><p>Arc Raiders has garnered somewhat of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-arc-raiders-one-of-the-most-pleasant-multiplayer-shooter-experiences-on-the-market-early-adopters-seem-to-think-so">a reputation for player pacifism since its launch earlier this year</a>. Some players have even argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-are-waging-war-over-a-controversial-topic-are-pvpers-ruining-the-experience">PvPers were ruining the experience, in what is clearly a high-stakes PvPvE genre</a>. Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">even quizzed a sociologist on the matter</a>, given the interesting dynamic between those friendly players and others engaging with the extraction shooter as intended.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand, there's plenty to do right now in Arc Raiders. In fact, today <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-snow-map-condition-flickering-flames">the game's frosty map condition has been added to the game</a>, with a Christmas-themed community event pushing raiders to head out and collect berries for the festive season.</p>

<p>According to a post on Reddit from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ChrisCube64/">ChrisCube64</a>, the reduced input lag has now made the game "actually playable". The original post reported lag of around 14 frames, but a follow-up comment noted that the speed running community timed the input lag at 6 frames. The update has now reportedly reduced this down to around 4 or 5 frames.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2FTBspZymlg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0hnjwlt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Still not perfect, then, but any improvement is a win. Other users are reporting reduced input lag for other titles on the GameCube app, but it seems the most notable improvement is on The Wind Waker. We've reached out to Nintendo to hopefully obtain official confirmation, and we'll update this article in due course.</p>
<p>The GameCube app now boasts a total of seven playable games, including the aforementioned Wind Waker and Wario World, along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II.</a> More are on the way in the future, including the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One of the surprises of The Game Awards 2025 (well, I should say up to a few hours before the event, since the announcement <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leak-suggests-game-is-a-remake-of-the-first-installment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked beforehand</a>) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. Fans of the most famous gaming heroine knew that Crystal Dynamics was working on a new game, which was indeed unveiled at the show, but the remake of the beloved first entry in the action/adventure series was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will offer Lara Croft fans a chance to experience some of the old-school magic in 2026, on the 30th anniversary of the franchise, leaving Crystal Dynamics a bit more time to release the new entry in 2027. The game is being co-developed with Flying Wild Hog, the Polish studio behind Hard Reset, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-warrior-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Warrior</a>, Trek to Yomi, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/evil-west-ungodly-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evil West</a>.</p>



<p>The Italian website Multiplayer <a href="https://multiplayer.it/articoli/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis-passato-futuro-lara-croft-crystal-dynamics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the chance to interview two key developers from Crystal Dynamics</a>, Game Director Will Kerslake and Studio Head Scot Amos, following the TGA 2025 announcement. Speaking about Legacy of Atlantis, they said:</p>



<p><em><strong>Scot Amos:</strong> We want to honor the original DNA of Core Design, but through the lens of the modern gamer.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Will Kerslake:</strong> The realities of 1996 and 2026 are different. We want Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to evoke the same feelings as the first time you played it, but it must be a modern game experience when you play it. We kept the confident Lara and most of the puzzles, but had to completely rebuild the combat and exploration systems. </em></p>



<p>Granted, we wouldn't have expected anything different. This isn't a remaster, and the game would feel very old as a reimagining if those key systems were kept unchanged. Still, Kerslake also said that the brutal traps of the original Tomb Raider, such as the big, deadly rolling boulders, have been maintained.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Crystal Dynamics developers confirmed that the Lara Croft seen in Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis and in the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst is the same character, just in different stages of her life and career. The former game revisits her origins, while Catalyst, which will indeed be set in India <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-tomb-raider-rumored-to-be-open-world-set-in-india-out-soon-lara-has-a-motorcycle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as per earlier rumors</a>, will show Lara at her pinnacle.</p>



<p>In both games, Lara will be voiced by British actress Alix Wilton Regan, whose credits include Calista in The Last Story, Samantha Traynor in Mass Effect 3, the female Inquisitor in Dragon Age: Inquisition (and Veilguard), Aya in Assassin's Creed Origins, Selemene on Dota: Dragon's Blood, Alt Cunnigham in Cyberpunk 2077, the Daedric Prince Ithelia in The Elder Scrolls Online: Gold Road, Lea in Lies of P: Overture, and the female player character in the upcoming Squadron 42.</p>

            <p>There's now a free demo available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S, ahead of the full release in January.</p>
<p>The demo includes the iconic first chapter of the game, and progress will carry over to the main game. Note that on Switch 2, you'll need at least 8GB of space to download the demo, but this is a great opportunity to see how the game runs on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>What's more, you can grab a free copy of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> game if you pre-order Remake digitally on either platform. That's only available until 31st January 2026, but that's enough time to experience the 1996 original before diving into Remake.</p>

<p>Those who pre-order the physical version of Remake will receive a Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Play Booster back, containing 15 random cards (while stocks last, at least).</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake will release on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S on 22nd January 2026. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">full Remake trilogy will eventually be available across both platforms</a>, in addition to PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, though, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">physical version of the game will be a Game Key Card</a>, meaning it's just a physical key for a download - you'll still need over 90GB of space for the game, making it one of the largest on the system.</p>
<p>Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi has also confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">development of the third part won't be impacted by the multiplatform approach</a>. It remains unknown if its eventual release will be simultaneous, or a PlayStation exclusive for a limited time.</p>

<p>Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/are-you-unsure-about-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-for-switch-2-dont-worry-therell-be-a-demo">teased</a> it earlier this year, but surprise! The free <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> demo is now live on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html#Overview">Switch 2 eShop</a>.</p>
<p>We've got a new trailer (above) showcasing what you can expect from this one on Switch 2 and Xbox — though, if you have already played it elsewhere, the cutscene content will be old news.</p>
<p>The free demo will take you through the entirety of the opening Mako Reactor 1 bombing mission, and yes, your save data will carry over to the main game, so there's no need to worry about playing it all through again next year.</p>
<p>Those who play through the demo will be gifted the bonus items “Revival Earrings” and “Survival Set” in the full game when it releases on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, FFVII Remake plays at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/square-enix-confirms-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-runs-at-a-stable-30fps-on-switch-2">"stable" 30fps</a> on Switch 2, but that hasn't stopped everyone who has played it from having a wonderful time. We loved our time with the port when we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands-on at Gamescom</a> earlier this year, and Digital Foundry previously called it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">"The best-looking thing" on Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <p>What's that I hear? Tinkly piano and the crashing of waves. Oh, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first major expansion, which devs Team Cherry have just announced will be coasting up to the shore some point next year. It's called Sea of Sorrow, and as such looks to contain plenty of somber staring into the splashy swell.</p>

<p>Team Cherry announced this forthcoming addition to the metroidvania via the trailer above and <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">a blog post</a>, also noting that the nautically-themed Sea of Sorrow'll be "free for all players". It'll include "new areas, bosses, tools, and more".</p>
<p>The trailer itself's made up of four shots. Two are just some fishing hooks and the shot of Hornet from the update's key art, but in between are a couple that could have more intrigue to them. First's a shot of some creature or object resting atop a wooden platform and tied under a sheet, somewhat resembling a tomb. Then, there's a shot of an ornate, but damaged, glass and gold structure being struck by crackling lightning. It's also littered with what look like discarded bug wings.</p>
<p>What the skong does any of that mean? Well, I'm nowhere near dialled enough into the Hollow Knightverse to speculate, with Team Cherry promising more will be revealed prior to release.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the studio have released a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/">beta update</a> for the Steam and GOG PC versions of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, to coincide with it being released on some device from an obscure company called Tin Nendo. Nah, I've never heard of them either. The PC update's headlined by support for 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratios and extra controller support. Team Cherry have also sought to reduce any colour banding and made the game pause automatically when you open up your inventory.</p><p>Aside from that, there are some general bug fixes, and one problem on Steam Deck you'll still have to work around for now. "There is an issue with cutscenes showing a 'test pattern' when playing on Steam Deck, which is due to the system defaulting to an incompatible proton version," Team Cherry wrote of the latter. "We are working on a fix for this, but for now it can be worked around by selecting a 'Linux Runtime' version in the compatibility settings, which forces the system to use the Linux-native version of the game."</p>
<p>As usual, instructions as to how to opt into the beta can be found in Team Cherry's post about it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to go and buy some Hornet-sized armbands and a rubber ring.</p>

This shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, as Silksong's initial release date wasn't announced until just a month before it dropped after one of gaming's most infamous drawn out affairs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the announcement of the DLC, Team Cherry also revealed that a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the original Hollow Knight is in development. This improved version incorporates "all the updates and enhancements that Silksong received on the platform: high frame-rate modes, higher resolutions, and many additional graphical effects."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The even better news? If you already own Hollow Knight on Switch, you'll be able to upgrade to this new gen version for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Australian studio will also be updating all current versions of the original Metroidvania soulslike and adding features and bug fixes. If you're playing on PC, some of those changes have already come into effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“PC players can experience many of those updates right now, via the public-beta branches on Steam and GOG, where they’ve just gone live,” a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Cherry blog post</a> states. “That includes full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support for those of you with Steam Decks or ultrawide monitors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the DLC announcement, Team Cherry said Hollow Knight: silksong had sold more than 7 million copies since going on sale in September, and had millions more playing on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected (enough to crash all of the storefronts!)," Team Cherry said. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game’s challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home. Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now seems like as good a time as any to get into both Hollow Knight games, then. IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">Hollow Knight review</a> returned a 9.4. We said: "Hollow Knight’s rich world and incredible depth of content will make you want to explore its caves for dozens of hours."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a> scored the game 9/10. We said: "Hollow Knight: Silksong is packed full of sharp platforming, enticing exploration, and nail-biting combat that's all unapologetically challenging in just the right way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <p>Team Cherry's oh-so-challenging platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has sold over 7m copies since its release in September.</p>
<p>Silksong is the follow up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, and ever since it was announced back in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youve-just-made-my-day-live-reactions-to-the-silksong-release-date">many were left desperate to get their hands on it</a>. It finally materialised three months ago across multiple platforms, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">crashing many digital store fronts in the process thanks to the sudden influx of eager players</a>. How many eager players? Well, quite a lot!</p>

<p>Team Cherry has today announced it has sold over 7m copies of Silksong in the last few months. That number is full fat sales, and does not include the "millions more" who have played via Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p><p>"It's a truly staggering number of players, more than we could have ever expected," <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">Team Cherry said</a>. "Watching the community grow, seeing the amazing art, the mods, the unexpected strategies, and the support between players through the game's challenges has been hugely rewarding for us here at home.</p>
<p>"Your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further."</p>
<p>Speaking of expanding the game even further, the developer went on to detail Silksong's first expansion known as Sea of Sorrow, which is coming out next year. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/team-cherry-unveils-first-big-silksong-expansion-sea-of-sorrow-and-its-completely-free">nautically themed expansion will include new areas, bosses, tools and more when it arrives as a free update for all players</a>.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/any-future-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-would-exist-alongside-the-others-as-standalone-entry-says-team-cherry">Team Cherry recently flirted with the idea of more entries in its Hollow Knight series</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>
