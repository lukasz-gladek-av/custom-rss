In February next year, it'll be joined by the brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a> which is much more than a remake of Yakuza 3, says RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/interview/2066901.html">GameWatch</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-include-major-hints-about-where-the-like-a-dragon-series-is-headed-rgg-studio-lead-says/">Automaton</a>), Masayoshi-san has said that this remake "contains some major hints about the future direction of the series."</p>
<p>"We haven't officially announce anything related to that yet," Masayoshi continues "But once you play it, I think you’ll get an idea, or rather, a pretty solid sense of what we intend to do with the series going forward.”</p>
<p>Well, considering there are five more mainline games (not including spin-offs such as Judgment or Gaiden) set <em>after</em> Yakuza 3, that's a little surprising!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4f4ecc176b6f"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4f4ecc176b6f/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Dark Ties is the major new content, but other changes may well be coming — <em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of those are on Switch consoles either, and with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/yakuza_like_a_dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/like_a_dragon_infinite_wealth">Infinite Wealth</a> both starring a different protagonist (though Kiryu does pop up, because of course he does), it certainly leaves us with some questions.</p>
<p>Masayoshi also insists that the new story starring Yoshitaka Mine, Dark Ties, is "extremely shocking", stating that it's one of the "darkest" stories in the series' history: "if you think Yakuza Kiwami 3 is just a remake, you’d be hugely mistaken."</p>
<p>Well, even without that little hint, it certainly sounds like a lot more than a rehash of the original PS3 release.</p>

<p><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties comes to Switch 2 on 12th February 2025. Will you be picking the game up? What do you think is in store for the series' future? Get pumped up in the comments below.</em></p>

			<p>At the time of this writing, The Game Awards is only ten days away, which means that we're getting close to the end of 2025 and that we're potentially days away from seeing the biggest reveals for the video game industry in 2025. The nominees for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">almost every category were already announced</a>, save for the only category that is decided entirely by public vote: the Player's Voice Award.</p>



<p>The Player's Choice Award is decided over three rounds of voting, and the first round <a href="https://thegameawards.com/brackets/players-voice">was pushed live to The Game Awards website today</a> for players to check out and vote on. It starts with 30 games, of which players can pick their favourite 10 to potentially move into the next round.</p>



<p>You can head to the website to select your preferred 10 now, and it's recommended that you do so sooner than later if you want your vote to count in each round, since the voting for round one will end as of Tuesday, December 2, at 6pm PT / 9pm ET. </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, all six games nominated for Game of the Year made the cut for the Players' Voice. In fact, most of the 30 games are nominated in at least one other category for this year's Game Awards. There are, however, a couple of games that aren't nominated anywhere else save for Players' Voice, including Delta Force, Genshin Impact, Warframe, and REPO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been almost three months since right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>assassinated in September</span></a><span>. When it happened, the right was quick to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>tear down anyone who didn’t suddenly forget his prejudiced rhetoric when he was killed</span></a><span>, but in the months since, a lot of the fallout of Kirk’s death has been in memes, whether that be in </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@anaylhc/video/7574231060104465686?lang=en"><span>“Kirkifying” images</span></a><span> by photoshopping his face on anything you can find, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-assassination-bandai-namco-ai-model-gunpla-2000626472"><span>AI mock-ups of gunpla sets</span></a><span> of his death, or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891"><span>creating characters that look like him in video games</span></a><span>. In the past few weeks, an AI-generated song about Kirk has begun spreading throughout the internet, and you’ve probably heard it in fandom spaces online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUHpUXlsvbI"><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk”</span></a><span> is a three-and-a-half-minute, AI-generated slop song by AI “artist” Spalexma. As the name implies, the song is meant to be a tribute to Kirk, and a declaration that his supporters will “carry the flame” of his right-wing views. It is absolutely one of the most ostentatious, dramatic pieces of “music” I’ve ever heard. The song was originally posted just a week after Kirk’s death, but it has gained significant traction on various platforms in the weeks since.</span></p>

  <p><span>The AI singer is belting with the passion you’d typically hear in an ‘80s power ballad, all about how those still on Earth will pick up the torch now that Kirk is gone. Whether the AI slop was meant as a genuine tribute to Kirk or a musical encapsulation of the right’s self-important made-up war on behalf of Christianity, the song has, like much of the reaction to Kirk’s death, been swept up in the shitpost factory, and the internet has been littered with videos set to the song with more views than the original. Some videos play it straight, simply using its hokey, anthemic instrumentation as a backdrop for dramatic imagery. Others have basically made it a modern-day Rick Roll, a musical rugpull meant to troll anyone who passes by it online.</span></p>

There’s a comment under this one that says, “They don’t even treat Jesus like this.”&nbsp;</span></p>     <p><span>“We Are Charlie Kirk” is currently Spalexma’s most-popular song on streaming services like Spotify, but even there, its streams are dwarfed by the views videos using it have gotten over the past three months. So it seems like most people aren’t listening to it unironically. The AI “artist” has several other songs that seem to be Christian in nature, so I assume this song was meant to be an earnest tribute to Kirk, but the internet has definitely not taken it that way, and continues to run it into the ground.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"what are we?" we are charlie kirk girl</p> <p>— brandon (@BR0IG) <a href="https://twitter.com/BR0IG/status/1992709018201317653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">some kids on the bus started blasting we are charlie kirk &amp; the hooded guy in front of me turned round to look at them and it was riz ahmed <a href="https://t.co/QhWZnWVbyC">pic.twitter.com/QhWZnWVbyC</a></p> <p>— lú (@botaniyya) <a href="https://twitter.com/botaniyya/status/1994448939764904010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame, we fight for the gospel, we'll honor his name.” <a href="https://t.co/WzQhLav68c">pic.twitter.com/WzQhLav68c</a></p> <p>— Just a Random JOLLY Person 🎄☃️ (@aRandom_acc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/aRandom_acc_/status/1994122109195563292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We are all Charlie Kirk" <a href="https://t.co/hZUO5F3ivT">pic.twitter.com/hZUO5F3ivT</a></p> <p>— TheRealThelmaJohnson (@TheRealThelmaJ1) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRealThelmaJ1/status/1992828878029828213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">teto: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>miku: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>neru: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk</p> <p>all 3 together: we, are, charlie kirk. we are charlie kirk <a href="https://t.co/RV1PMnafpv">pic.twitter.com/RV1PMnafpv</a></p> <p>— REIKA (@0_ka815) <a href="https://twitter.com/0_ka815/status/1991768913039004058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA 6 will reportedly feature a “We Are Charlie Kirk” radio station that loops the track for roughly 6/7 hours 🔥‼️ <a href="https://t.co/6dkjoNxxja">pic.twitter.com/6dkjoNxxja</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/1993760858368078228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is part of the reason why the "we are charlie kirk" and "kirkification" memes went insanely viral. you can't mandate reverence for a generation that saw their classmates get slaughtered in school shootings. <a href="https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f">https://t.co/LQkovzmD7f</a></p> <p>— hasanabi (@hasanthehun) <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1994510376046834132?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

The reel was quickly scrubbed off the internet, but Redditors found and posted mirrors of it. And as viewed by GameSpot, the clips do look like early GTA 6.</p>

<p>One clip shows a male character detach a "LomBike"--likely a parody of the IRL LimeBike rental service--from its docking station, turn it around, and sit on it. Seconds later, that same character returns the bike to its dock.</p><p>The other two clips show a female character getting off a pick-up truck in two different ways. In the first, she swings her legs out from inside the bed and jumps down. The second sees the same female character, standing atop the roof of the same pick-up truck, jump down into the bed before vaulting over and landing on the ground.</p><p>This isn't anything new for GTA. You can hijack and drive cars, so of course Rockstar Games would be creating multiple animations for how you get in and out of them, or climb onto and jump off of them. You can also ride bikes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/" data-ref-id="5000-18357">GTA: San Andreas</a> and other games in the franchise, and as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-footage-leaks-online-before-being-scrubbed-from-the-internet-but-it-didnt-reveal-much-at-all-and-weve-even-seen-part-of-it-before-in-an-official-screenshot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN noted</a>, "LomBike" made a small appearance in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI/_next/image?url=%2FVI%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FVice_City_03.9b0e117a.jpg&amp;w=1024&amp;q=75" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official screenshot</a> from earlier this year. So, it's very likely that you can rent and ride bikes in GTA 6, and that's maybe the most fascinating part of this leak: It suggests what we could expect from the game when it comes out.</p><p>This seemingly real leak comes not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-generated-gta-6-gameplay-leaks-are-going-viral-following-delay/1100-6536534/" data-ref-id="1100-6536534">AI-generated leaks of the game went viral</a> on social media. The creator, an X user named Zap Actu GTA6, has since admitted to trolling everyone with the "entirely generated by AI" gameplay videos and took them all down, vowing to stick to GTA 6 news and theory-based content.</p><p>GTA 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently pushed back</a> from May 26, 2026 to November 19, 2026, with experts believing the delay could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-and-next-xbox-may-not-release-until-2028-due-to-gta-6-delay-expert-says/1100-6536134/" data-ref-id="1100-6536134">impact the release of the next PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-cost-rockstar-60-million-as-insiders-report-game-is-content-complete/1100-6536115/" data-ref-id="1100-6536115">potentially cost Rockstar Games $60 million</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Embracer Group <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-sells-cryptic-studios-arc-games-retains-right-to-remnant-fellowship/">shed two more companies it had scooped up during its acquisition spree</a> that led to a major collapse when <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">a massive $2 billion deal fell through</a>, and the company was unable to recover. This time, it was Remnant II publisher Arc Games and developer Cryptic Studios who were able to escape Embracer Group before the company shut them down, as it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/volition-games-the-studio-behind-saints-row-red-faction-has-been-shut-down-by-embracer/">Volition Games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/timesplitters-fans-have-their-hopes-crushed-once-again-by-new-closure-of-developer-free-radical-design/">Free Radical Design</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Arc Games is the newest independent publisher of double-A games on the block, thanks to a successful buyout from Embracer with the help of XD Inc., which provided financing support to make the buyout possible.</p>



<p>The publisher's current organizational structure will remain the same during the transition, and the company will not be laying off any members of its team. It's the ideal scenario where Arc Games doesn't collapse under a larger parent company that made some pretty callous decisions.</p>



<p>"<em>This milestone marks a major new chapter for Arc Games</em>," said chief executive officer Yoon Im, in a press release. "<em>We appreciate our time being a part of Embracer Group and the accomplishments achieved since the company's inception over 15 years ago. These</em> <em>experiences have shaped who we are today. As an independent publisher,</em> <em>we are now positioned to more fully pursue our vision - collaborating with exceptional developers worldwide and bringing standout games to market. 2026 is already shaping up to be one of the most ambitious and innovative years in our history, and we are excited for what lies ahead</em>."</p>



<p>Along with publishing both Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II, Arc Games is also known for publishing the Torchlight series, Star Trek Online, Neverwinter, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-gets-slight-delay-early-access-debut-avoid-battlefield-6/">recently released Fellowship</a>. It has also published titles like Have A Nice Death and Hyper Light Breaker.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 has revealed the 30 games up for Players’ Choice. The category, fully fan-voted, usually determines what fans believe to be the Game of the Year, outside of the show’s own pick.</p>



<p>After moving away from traditional media in 2014,&nbsp;The Game Awards&nbsp;has become a big celebration for the best of gaming each year. Hosted by Geoff Keighley, the streamed event has become home to several big reveals and moments. With a year as big as 2025 was for games (like Clair Obscur and Death Stranding 2), there’s plenty to root for.&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nominations for the awards</a>&nbsp;came out earlier in November and fans were surprised to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-upsets-from-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some games left out</a> of Game of the Year contention. Luckily, as per tradition, the Players’ Choice category can help claim the public’s choice, and this year has some good ones.</p>

<p>It might have been one of the worst-kept secrets in video games in the run-up to its official announcement, but yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is coming to Switch 2. In fact, it's arriving tomorrow.</p>
<p>Now, we were rather impressed with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> when it arrived on the new hybrid system back in September as the <em>first</em> open-world Ubisoft joint on the console, but who was to say that Shadows would perform equally well? If this very question has struck you in the lead-up to launch, have no fear, the above footage should answer all of your questions.</p>
<p>Alongside providing our full thoughts in our review, we have also captured 12 minutes of Shadows gameplay so you can get a taste of how the whole thing runs on Switch 2. The answer, fortunately, is that it runs pretty well.</p>
<p>The gameplay footage showcases all manner of different environments, including busy fight sequences, cutscenes and more serene open-world exploring, and while there is certainly some slowdown in particularly intense moments, things tend to stick to the targeted 30fps — always a welcome sight. Those who have played on beefier consoles will likely notice the step back in resolution and textures, but it plays it off pretty well in motion.</p>
<p>We took these minor technical hiccups into account in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our review</a>, where we stated that Shadows "isn't a <em>perfect</em> port, then, but it’s still a colossal achievement and one of the best-looking games on Nintendo’s console".</p>

		<p>Tunic Team has announced that there is going to a Tunic concert taking place, and you will have to head to London’s Cadogan Hall on February 8th to experience it. The soundtrack of Tunic, composed by Terence Lee &amp; Janice Kwan, will be performed by a six piece ensemble and it will have a visual companion element to it too, so the audience can feel immersed in the experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="TUNIC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5XpgTO7YN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the description for Tunic Live In Concert, it says, <em>“Join us for an unforgettable evening where the beloved soundtrack of the award-winning indie adventure comes alive through the power of a six-piece musical ensemble. Enter a realm of hidden pathways and whispered secrets. Let the music of&nbsp;Tunic&nbsp;become your manual.The performance will be paired with stunning visuals from the game, immersing you in its lush landscapes and world filled with secrets. An adventure in sound. A concert you’ll never forget.”</em></p>
<p>The performance will begin at 6:30PM and last for approximately two hours, while ticket prices vary from £25 to £65, depending on where you choose to sit. If you want to grab tickets, you can head to the <a href="https://cadoganhall.com/whats-on/tunic-live-in-concert/">Tunic Live In Concert</a> site to purchase them.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/24/tunic-review-xbox-pc/">Tunic Review&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>In our Tunic review, Steve said,<em> “Tunic had a lot to live up to after years of built up expectation, and it doesn’t just meet them, it shatters them and stands out as one of the most joyous gaming experiences I’ve had in years. It takes a little while to feel at home in Tunic’s gorgeously rendered world, but once it clicks and the secrets of the masterfully constructed in-game manual start to reveal themselves, the resulting game is up there with the likes of Zelda in terms of exploration and discoveries.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dan-houser-calls-people-pushing-genai-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar co-founder and one of the most instrumental creatives behind series like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption, Dan Houser, has had a lot to say about generative AI lately. As Houser continues to participate in interviews as part of promoting his new book, <a href="https://wccftech.com/american-caper-a-better-paradise-gta-creator-dan-houser-absurd-ventures/">A Better Paradise Volume One: An Aftermath</a>, his latest comments on generative AI are not aimed at the technology itself, but at the people pushing for its use in all situations.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginRadioUK/videos/851083790630384/">The Chris Evans Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio UK</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-writer-dan-houser-says-the-people-leading-the-push-for-ai-are-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">VGC</a>), when Houser was asked about generative AI, he agreed that it would never be able to replace human creativity, as he's said before, and further added, "<em>Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>They're sort of saying, 'we're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. One of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans.</em>"</p>



<p>Evans followed up by asking if Houser believes that generative AI, in its current state and in the future, will be the massive success that executives who are pushing for its use believe it will be. "<em>As far as I understand it, I personally don't think it will</em>," Houser began. </p>



<p>"<em>Because I think AI is eventually going to eat itself, because as I understand it - which is really a superficial understanding - the models scour the internet for information, but the internet's going to get more and more full of information made by the models, so it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information gets better if they're already running out of data. It will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly."</em></p>



<p>Recently, Houser said that <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-creator-reveals-favorite-character-says-llms-will-be-good-at-cheap-stuff-not-magic/">he's "<em></em><em>less scared than a lot of people</em>," with regard to the question of generative AI technology replacing humans</a>, particularly in creative roles. "<em>I think you're going to end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some ways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space. But if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I think they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exciting Commanders From Avatar: The Last Airbender To Build Around]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exciting-commanders-from-avatar-last-airbender-to-build-around</link>
            <guid>1369600</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s another set release, and with over 100 different new commander options we debated what to do with a set that had more Commander options than there are episodes of the show. In the end, we decided on not repeating the odyssey of ranking over 100 commanders like we did with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy Magic The Gathering </em>Parts 1</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2">and 2</a> because a lot of the individual uncommons aren’t really that interesting.</p>

<p>Instead, we’ll be doing a bit of a medley: looking at a handful of the commanders in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender </em>for <em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>(from both the main set and Jumpstart), discussing lore of Avatar with the representation of them (like we once did with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-lore-deep-cuts-of-doctor-who-commander-universes-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Doctor Who Commander: Deep Lore Only True Whovians Would Notice"><em>Doctor Who MTG</em></a>), and ranking some of the characters who got significant representation.</p>

<h2><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/207/avatar-aang-aang-master-of-elements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Aang">Avatar Aang</a></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-aang.jpg?itok=Pym2Zejr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-aang.jpg?itok=RDE7JIkk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kicking it off is Aang depicted at the end of the series, where he is fully realizing his powers in a duel with Ozai. This representation of Aang is a powerful 5 color value engine on the front face with him providing solid size as a 4/4 flier, who draws whenever you do bending – such as when you firebend by attacking with Aang! He’s the perfect leader for an ‘all-Avatar’ Commander deck with the 5 color identity, and being generally powerful caring about prominent set mechanics.</p>

<p>He gets stronger when you can do all of them, and flip him over for a large cost reduction mechanic that can give you a bevy of resources while returning your card draw engine, as well as being a beating. Unlike most colored cost reducers, Aang, Master of Elements also reduces the cost of generic mana, which means is incredibly strong with cards that have buyback, like doing infinite damage with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/201/searing-touch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Searing Touch">Searing Touch</a>. You can also trigger his avatar mode in emergency form without having mastered bending with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/isd/195/moonmist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Moonmist">Moonmist</a>&nbsp;to get to that sweet cost reduction even quicker.</p>

<h3>Ranking All Aang Commander Options&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 8 unique legendary Aang cards in the Avatar sets and here they are ranked:<br>
8) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/146/aang-a-lot-to-learn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, A Lot to Learn">Aang, a Lot to Learn</a><br>
7) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/4/aang-the-last-airbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, the Last Airbender">Aang, the Last Airbender</a><br>
6) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/210/aang-air-nomad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Air Nomad">Aang, Air Nomad</a><br>
5) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/204/aang-swift-savior-aang-and-la-oceans-fury" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Swift Savior /// Aang and La, Ocean's Fury">Aang, Swift Savior</a><br>
4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/74/aang-airbending-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, Airbending Master">Aang, Airbending Master</a><br>
3) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/203/aang-at-the-crossroads-aang-destined-savior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang, at the Crossroads //  Aang, Destined Savior ">Aang, at the Crossroads</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/69/aang-and-katara" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Aang and Katara">Aang and Katara</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/207/avatar-aang-aang-master-of-elements" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Aang /// Aang, Master of Elements">Avatar Aang</a></p>

<p>Any of the top 5 are good or better Commander options, with 2 and 4 providing Ally centric gameplay, while Aang, at the Crossroads shows Aang at the end of Book 2/Season 2 in a wonderfully flavorful card that manages to capture the fight going on, and how Aang was unable to enter the Avatar state until someone he cared for was hurt, and how even then a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/8ed/200/lightning-blast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lightning Blast">Lightning Blast</a> could take him down (if it hits the right rock...).</p>

<h2><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/130/avatar-kyoshi-earthbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Avatar Kyoshi, Earthbender">Avatar Kyoshi, Earthbender</a></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-kiyoshi-earthbender.jpg?itok=svxxC6bT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-kiyoshi-earthbender.jpg?itok=Cbft5ssR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Kyoshi is one of the past avatars represented by a saga in the main set (<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/186/the-legend-of-kyoshi-avatar-kyoshi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Legend of Kyoshi /// The Legend of Kyoshi">The Legend of Kyoshi</a>, which transforms into Avatar Kyoshi), and gets a full card in the Jumpstart product. Kyoshi is famed in the world of Avatar for her conviction and seeking justice she created a peaceful world, in contrast to Aang’s struggles and ties to the other people he loves and considers friends. Famously, she killed Chin, the Conqueror with a powerful feat of earthbending when she split the peninsula of her home off from the main land of the Earth Kingdom, and the cliff edge he stood on collapsed under him.</p>

<p>In Magic, we see Kyoshi shown at this height of her power, and focused on her use of earthbending. 8 Mana is a lot, but green is able to ramp like no one, and she wants to be in a deck with a lot of lands that she can animate with her earthbending each turn. She is one of the only repeatable earthbenders in the set, and each turn she can earthbend 8, turning a land into an 8/8. Her saga is also a perfect inclusion in the deck for double the Kiyoshi representation</p>

Born on the same day as <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/117/the-rise-of-sozin-fire-lord-sozin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Rise of Sozin ///  Fire Lord Sozin ">Fire Lord Sozin</a>, the two would be friends with Roku tempering his friend’s tendency to extremism, until he leaves for training as the Avatar. Without Roku, Sozin would continue his descent, even when his friend returned. Those old ties would make Roku reluctant to confront his old friend, letting the firelord prepare for his strike in secret, with only occasional confrontations between the two old friends. His <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/145/the-legend-of-roku-avatar-roku?back" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Legend of Roku ///  Avatar Roku ">saga card</a>, which works well with Avatar Roku, Firebender, depicts him giving the advise to Aang to be more decisive than he was, as well as showing how he was close to dragons who Fire Lords would have largely killed off.</p>

<p>Roku’s card shows his part in a world that was growing closer together, and how he was less confrontational than Kyoshi. Getting 6 mana whenever anyone attacks for that combat is obviously useful, and Roku himself provides the ability to tilt combat and play politics with his +3/+0 to target creature. Use it to punish aggressors by buffing blockers, or to help take on a stronger foe with the attacker, or to fund your <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/64/fire-nation-turret" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Nation Turret">Fire Nation Turret</a>.</p>

This old man was in fact a friend of Aang’s before the Avatar hid away in an iceberg, and in his first appearance is a trickster mentor to Aang and friends as shown in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/169/bumi-king-of-three-trials" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bumi, King of Three Trials">Bumi of Three Trials</a>, while <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/248/bumi-eclectic-earthbender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bumi, Eclectic Earthbender">Bumi, Eclectic Earthbender</a>&nbsp;shows him at the end of that when they chose to duel the old man instead of his obviously muscular <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/179/flopsie-bumis-buddy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Flopsie, Bumi's Buddy">Ape-Goat pet Flopsie</a>. An eccentric and openminded thinker, Bumi is also a brilliant tactician and strategist, who after the capture of Omashu waited his time to take action against the fire nation.</p>

<p>Bumi, Unleashed shows him breaking out and leading an assault to retake his city at the end of the series, around the same time that Aang is fighting Ozai as depicted in Avatar Aang. He gives you 9 power for 5 mana over two creatures, and will provide double combat opportunities for all your earthbended and otherwise animated land. There’s a lot of competition in <em>Avatar </em>for land attack leaders, but Bumi is one of the best, and just wants you to invite&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/170/ashaya-soul-of-the-wild" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ashaya, Soul of the Wild">Ashaya, Soul of the Wild</a>&nbsp;to the party as well.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fire-lord-azula_0.jpg?itok=E9GYf-x4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fire-lord-azula_0.jpg?itok=Jkk1NVbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the most prominent villains of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, Azula is the younger sister of Zuko. She begins appearing in the second season, and is perhaps at the height of her power at the end of that season when she takes over Ba Sing Se. While the other young characters in Avatar grow, Azula fails to and it is a bit sad that this card depicting her at the end of the third season doesn’t really capture her fall into paranoia and general mental break, although she remains a formidable bending prodigy, which it does aptly capture as she is going to duel her brother.</p>

<p>Leaving aside it being one of the weaker flavor alignments, Fire Lord Azula is a powerhouse. A 4/4 for 4 in Grixis color identity, she will copy any spells you cast while she’s attacking, and fuel those spells with firebending 2. This can work well for a lot of strategies like storm combo, spell slinger, or even something along the lines of voltron making use of pump spells. Note that she copies any type of spell, including creatures like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/165/dualcaster-mage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dualcaster Mage">Dualcaster Mage</a>&nbsp;if you want to make all the copies.</p>

<h3>Ranking All Azula Commander Options</h3>

<p>There are 4 unique Azula cards across the Avatar product line, and I would rank them:</p>

<p>4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/85/azula-on-the-hunt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, On the Hunt">Azula, On the Hunt</a><br>
3) <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Azula,%20Ruthless%20Firebender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/101/azula-ruthless-firebender">Azula, Ruthless Firebender</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/208/azula-cunning-usurper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, Cunning Usurper">Azula, Cunning Usurper</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/220/fire-lord-azula" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Azula">Fire Lord Azula</a></p>

<p>(Side note: Firebending does not add red to the color identity of these cards. It is part of the reminder text, thus like <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aextort&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Extort">extort</a>&nbsp;its not counted as part of the card's rule text setting its color identity in Commander.)</p>

<p>Azula, Cunning Usurper shows Azula at the height of her power at the end of Season 2, as mentioned above when emerges victorious after a fight with Aang and friends. This version of the card though has less color identity, and really wants you to be playing a blink deck to reset the cards she has exiled. As a bonus, there is a fifth Azula on the bonus sheet, which is a new version of <em>Portal Three Kingdom</em> card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/27/diaochan-artful-beauty" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Azula, Flame of Ember Island">Diaochan, Artful Beauty</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/221/fire-lord-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Zuko">Fire Lord Zuko</a></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fire-lord-zuko.jpg?itok=LwYQXPpZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fire-lord-zuko.jpg?itok=lzBlZx2l 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Of all characters in Avatar, none has a greater character arc than Zuko. Beginning as an exile seeking to return home by accomplishing an impossible task (find the Avatar who had been missing for a century), he eventually evolves into the character we see depicted in Fire Lord Zuko. At the very end of the series, this shows Zuko as the new leader of the Fire Nation having defeated his sister and setting the nation on a path that ends the war, and lead to a more prosperous future.</p>

<p>In Mardu colors, Fire Lord Zuko is a payoff for exile casting or blinking of permanents. Take advantage of impulse draw (like Prosper, Tome Bound), and blink spells to grow your creatures and as you do Zuko gets bigger and firebends even more mana.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Ranking All Zuko Commander Options&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 8 unique legendary Zuko cards in the Avatar sets (in addition to a bonus sheet printing of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/52/rhys-the-redeemed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Redeemed">Zuko, Redeemed, an overlay of Rhys, the Redeemed</a>)&nbsp;and here they are ranked:</p>

<p>8) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/150/zuko-seeking-honor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Seeking Honor">Zuko, Seeking Honor</a><br>
7) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/163/zuko-exiled-prince" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Exiled Prince">Zuko, Exiled Prince</a><br>
6) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/246/zuko-avatar-hunter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Avatar Hunter">Zuko, Avatar Hunter</a><br>
5)&nbsp;<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/253/zuko-conflicted" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Conflicted">Zuko, Conflicted</a><br>
4) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/90/the-blue-spirit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Blue Spirit">The Blue Spirit</a><br>
3) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/127/zuko-firebending-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zuko, Firebending Master">Zuko, Firebending Master</a><br>
2) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tle/68/mai-and-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Mai and Zuko">Mai and Zuko</a><br>
1) <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tla/221/fire-lord-zuko" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fire Lord Zuko">Fire Lord Zuko</a></p>

<p>For those who don’t know the show, the inclusion of the Blue Spirit here may be slightly confusing. In Season/Book 1, Aang is captured by Admiral Zhao, and Zuko, who needs to bring home himself to restore his honor and place in the family, realizes that Zhao will now get that credit. So, in the titular episode, Zuko dresses up as The Blue Spirit, and frees Aang from captivity, beginning the process of the two of them wondering if they could be friends, a trend which will eventually see culmination in Book 3: Fire. As for the card, flash appearing creatures is very much fitting the surprise appearance of The Blue Spirit, and the drawing represents the reinforcements.</p>

"Where the hell did that goblin go?" asks a mean knight of some sort whose English accent is of questionable authenticity at the beginning of the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a>. This is a reasonable question! When the goblin stealth game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goblin-stealth-gaming-returns-in-styx-blades-of-greed-out-in-2025-heres-the-first-trailer">revealed earlier this year</a>, it was slated for a 2025 release, except the rest of the year is in very short supply. So, this trailer acts as a double way: a confirmation of a delay, and the announcement of a proper release date.
</p>
<p>
Luckily if you love to be a little goblin that stealthily stabs folks, you've not got long to wait, as the game is now set to be released on February 19th, 2026, just over a couple of months away. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3290690/view/529864539779367425?l=english">Steam news post</a>, written from the perspective of the titular Styx himself, "the devs are taking a few extra months to polish everything up, tweak the bits that need tweaking, and make sure my grand return is as glorious (and chaotic) as it deserves to be. A much more sharper adventure. One worthy of slipping back into my slightly grimy, perfectly stylish boots."

<p>
This is the first new Styx in a good few years, as the last entry in the series, Shards of Darkness, came out way back in 2017. That's as good as a lifetime ago! I must admit it's not a series I've spent any time with, though from writing this I've discovered that I actually own that second one on Steam. I'll assume that found its way in through a bundle of some sort given my total lack of memory over acquiring it, though it does feel quite appropriate given the sneaky nature of the games.
</p><p>
If you've never partaken in the ways of Styx, it takes place in developer Cyanide Studio's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-men">Of Orcs and Men</a> world. As Styx, you have to creep and crawl amongst the shadows using some fancy magical abilities to take down your foes. In Blades of Greed, it looks like you'll be able to do things like slow down time, use what is ostensibly a force push, or do some mind control to make a guy walk off the edge of a tall building and fall to his, well, you know. Morbid! But that's video games.
</p>
<p>
If any of that is up your alley, you can wishlist Styx: Blades of Greed on Steam ahead of its release next year.

              <p>“Nostalgia is remembering when you didn’t have to pay bills and attributing that feeling to Mario.” That’s what my head <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hdvm3rm4juqhxk5nqvzopzhm/post/3lkz225nyfk2e">tells me</a>, anyway. My heart, on the other hand, leaps and applauds every time the plumber embarks on a new adventure. Let’s not beat around the bush: <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is a nostalgia play. Its best trick is briefly reminding you of when your life was someone else’s problem. It’s a lazy morning spent watching cartoons. It’s wasting a fistful of quarters on the <em>X-Men</em> machine at the arcade, barely beating the second stage, and not regretting a single moment. It’s one of the slickest, most fun beat ’em ups I’ve played in a while. Making the old-school, repetitive button-mashing formula feel this good and fresh again in 2025 is no small feat.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-marvel-cosmic-invasion-moonlighter-2000645207">Out December 1</a>, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> pits Captain America, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and more against the Negative Zone’s Anihiilus and the alien insectoids’ latest attempt to take over the galaxy. The result is a sprawling cast of 15 playable characters, including back-benchers like Ghost Rider and Phyla-Vell, each with unique animations, moves, special abilities, and voiced dialogue, hopscotching through a greatest hits reel of Marvel locations, villains, and recent movie lore tie-ins. The story doesn’t go much deeper than Anihilius using his alien parasites to mind-control everyone from Master Mold to Galactus, but it doesn’t need to.

Still have tons of challenges and achievements to complete. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p>The overall structure is very similar to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, the last 2D arcade throwback Tribute Games (<em>Flinthoo</em>k, <i>Mercenary Kings</i>) made with Dotemu (<em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <i>Windjammers 2</i>). There are 16 levels, each filled with small bits of environmental storytelling and gorgeous backgrounds. You fight a bunch of mobs, find some collectibles, complete extra challenges, and go up against a boss in a race to see whose health meter depletes first. It’s in the details, though, that <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> distinguishes itself. The most important is a hero-swapping mechanic that makes it feel as much a descendant of Marvel vs. Capcom as the original 1992 <em>X-Men</em> arcade beat ’em up.</p>

 <h2>A sprinkle of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> and a touch of <em>Diablo</em></h2> <p>Every hero has a punch, a dodge, or a block, and a special ability and ultimate that are both on cooldowns. Instead of just selecting one character to play as in each level, you can pick two and switch between them at will. You’ll want to do this because some characters can fly while others can’t. Black Panther is quick and deadly at close range, but struggles from far away or up in the air. Iron Man can pepper enemies like Mega Man or knee-stomp them from the air. Phoenix can use her telekinetic abilities to grab foes and fling them across the screen back at one another. Most importantly, you can call your second hero in to punch enemies with you or fire off a quick ultimate attack whenever you want.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649172" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649172"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649172">Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This makes the moment-to-moment gameplay a lot quicker and more dense than your standard side-scrolling beat ’em up or even 2023’s <em>Shredder’s Revenge</em>. By the end of my initial playthrough, I was firing off all of Iron Man’s blasts, closing the distance with his down diagonal jump-kick attack, calling in Jean Grey for an extra pummeling, using my giant beam canon ultimate, and then swapping back to the X-Men to unload her cooldown attacks. The meter for your special attacks builds up over time instead of with each basic attack, letting you be a lot more choosy and strategic about how you engage in fights. It almost feels a bit like <em>Diablo</em> at times, except you’re much more likely to get punished the moment you try to go on autopilot.</p>

 <p>Heroes level up to 10 and unlock small buffs along the way, but there’s no build-crafting to save you here, only your thumbs. Adding another dimension to combat is a dynamic health bar borrowed from <a href="https://kotaku.com/smashing-punks-feels-great-in-streets-of-rage-4-1833621783"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>. Get attacked, and a chunk of the bar becomes discolored. Go long enough killing enemies without getting hit again, and you’ll be able to heal it back. On normal difficulty, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is rarely challenging enough to make you think hard about how this mechanic fits into the overall rhythm of combat, but it’s still an interesting wrinkle that gives the game a bit more flair than some lesser releases in the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649173" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649173"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649173">Marvel Cosmic Invasion has a CRT filter option (middle), including a curved display (far right). Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent most of my time playing two-player couch co-op. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>‘s big ultimates and onscreen enemy count made this feel just the right level of busy, even if sometimes it still veers into chaotic spectacle over precision action. It makes me wonder if four players, while still fun, might start to just feel like a big trash can of nachos: novel, tasty, and way too much. The only time I ever got slight framerate drops playing on PS5 was when several characters on the screen were performing flying animations at the same time. It’s not rated for Steam Deck yet, but it performed just fine on my Rog Xbox Ally X.</p>

 <h2>A dazzling adventure that ends too soon</h2> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> has some very cool levels, including an Asgard visit that has you fighting aliens across a technicolor Bifrost rainbow bridge. It also has some filler ones that left a very little impression. They just felt like long corridors filled with familiar foes. Enemy variety is decent, but rarely requires mixing up tactics too much. By the home stretch, I was definitely a bit disappointed to keep blasting the same sentinels, bugs, and symbiotes I’d been thrashing all game. The cast of heroes and their bespoke loadouts is so impressive that it can leave the rest of the game struggling to measure up. Give players an inventive toolbox box and they’ll start looking for problems that can’t be solved by pumping the same button over and over again for several hours.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000649170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000649170"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000649170">Image: Tribute Games / Dotemu / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This sameness remains an inextricable part of <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>‘s charm, though. It sets you up in cool cosplay, gives you wild powers, and unleashes you in a 2D candy shop whose aisles shatter and explode in the most satisfying ways. Every character has a distinct moveset. Rocket Raccoon can slide into enemies and place mines or throw grenades. Beta Ray Bill can smash the ground with his hammer or throw it and keep it suspended in mid-air, spinning as it keeps comboing enemies into the side of the screen. The only thing more impressive than the game’s roster is its dedication to making each one feel as fleshed out and lovingly crafted as any retro game’s main character.</p> <p>Early brawlers were designed to test patience, eat wallets, and make players navigate the pitfalls of letting tedium lull them into an unwarranted sense of complacency. To completely give yourself over to the monotony of a beat ’em up, like letting your sleepy eyes glance shut on the highway, is to court existential danger. The game, like life, will punch back the moment you let your guard down. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> adds a new layer of spectacle and moveset management to the fray that, at times, borders on the breadth and creative possibilities you’d more often find in a fighting game.</p> <p>It’s over too soon and just one extra mode shy of what might feel like a more complete experience. If it follows the mold of Shredder’s Revenge, we’ll get a steady cadence of free updates and a paid DLC at some point. But for now, it does exactly what it needs to: add fresh tricks to a classic genre that makes it feel like you’re a ’90s Marvel action figure rampaging through a Saturday morning cartoon.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has not only emerged from the shadows in recent times, but it’s ready to step into the spotlight altogether with a full-scale Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> didn’t just go off the grid after it was announced in 2017; it disappeared into obscurity. It wasn’t to be seen or heard from again until Samus and co finally got a proper update in June 2024. Aptly, everyone is primed for Metroid’s launch in 2025, and Insider Gaming has its release date, start time info, and more.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release-date">What is The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Feel the power. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on December 4.</strong></p>







<p>18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, the world gets to go Beyond. There will be reasons galore as to why it’s taken so long to make, but no one should think about this for now. Instead, start checking you have space on your Nintendo Switch consoles, make sure you’ve got the day booked off work, and everyone can find out why Metroid Prime 4: Beyond took so long to get here.</p>



<p>Side note: You can buy and play Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on either the Nintendo Switch or its Switch 2 upgrade. The more the merrier, especially in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/top-holiday-video-games-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Holiday</a> season!</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’s sure to make a big landing. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Almost all Nintendo first-party games go live at 7 AM PT on release day, meaning Metroid should be available at 7 AM PT on December 4, with other regions to follow.</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo has said this about its first-party titles in the past. There’s no reason why it wouldn’t be the same, so here are the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release dates and times in key regions, based on existing information.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Release Times &amp; Dates</th></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">7:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">9:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">10:00 AM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Grenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3:00 PM—December 4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">New Zealand Daylight Time (NZDT)</td><td data-align="center">4:00 AM—December 5</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Where Winds Meet has reached a huge milestone: 9 million players in 2 weeks since launch. </p>



<p>The free-to-play RPG from Everstone Studios and NetEase Games was expected to do well at launch after Where Winds Meet managed to surpass 10 million pre-registrations, hitting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-hits-10m-pre-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final community goal</a> ahead of the title’s launch. Now, the devs have revealed that the game only took 14 days to reach a new milestone. </p>



<h2 id="h-where-winds-meet-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Where Winds Meet Shows No Signs of Stopping</h2>



<p>The new title from Everstone Studio and NetEase Games was released on November 14, 2025, and has been going strong ever since. It reached an all-time peak of 251,008 on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3564740/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> a week ago and has been averaging over 150,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. Where Winds Meet reached 9 million players across two platforms: PlayStation 5 and PC. The mobile release hasn’t happened yet, and pre-registrations are open at the moment. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Where Winds Meet is a Wuxia open-world action-adventure RPG set in ancient China in the tenth century. Players get to embody the role of a young swordmaster who is on a quest to&nbsp;uncover forgotten truths and solve the mysteries of their own identity. </p>



<p>The game features Wuxia—style traversal: scale rooftops, glide through the air, or use fast travel to navigate between regions swiftly. There are also options for combat, including melee, ranged, and stealth playstyles, with weapons such as swords, spears, dual blades, rope darts, bows, fans, and umbrellas. The game features over 20 unique regions with diverse characters, authentic activities, ancient cities, forgotten tombs, and much more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hytale has released its PC performance and system requirements for the game, which is scheduled to go into early access on January 13, 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-hytale-system-requirements">Hytale System Requirements</h2>







<div><p>Hytale requires both a 64-bit processor and operating system.</p><p>● <strong>Minimum:</strong> Targeting 30+ FPS at 1080p on Low preset.<br>● <strong>Recommended:</strong> Targeting 60+ FPS at 1080p on High preset.<br><strong>● Creator/Streamer:</strong> Stable framerate with high-quality video capture and streaming at<br>1440p.</p><p>These categories reflect actual in-house testing across low-end integrated GPUs, mid-range<br>laptops, and high-end recording setups.</p></div>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements-1080p-30-fps">Minimum Requirements (1080p @ 30 FPS)</h3>



<div><p>●<strong> OS:</strong> 64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i5-7500 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 3 1200 (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM:</strong><br>○ Singleplayer, with dedicated graphics: 8 GB<br>○ Singleplayer, with integrated graphics: 12 GB<br>○ Multiplayer-only: 8 GB</p><p>● <strong>GPU:</strong><br><strong> Integrated:</strong> <br>■ Intel UHD Graphics 620<br>■ AMD Radeon Vega 3○ <br><strong>Dedicated:</strong><br>■ NVIDIA GTX 900 Series<br>■ AMD Radeon 400 Series<br>■ Intel Arc A-Series<br><strong>Deprecation notice: Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.<br></strong><br><strong>● Storage: </strong>SATA SSD with 20 GB of free space</p><p><strong>● Network:</strong> 2 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible).</p><p><em>Based on benchmarks where Intel HD Graphics 630 achieved ~30–34 FPS at 1080p. We definitely recommend setting the “view distance” to 192 blocks. Ensure that no other programs are running to guarantee performance.</em></p></div>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements-1080p-60-fps">Recommended Requirements (1080p @ 60 FPS)</h3>







<div><p>● <strong>OS: </strong>64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i5-10400 (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM: </strong>16 GB</p><p>● <strong>GPU:</strong><br><strong>Integrated:</strong><br>■ Intel Iris Xe Graphics<br>■ AMD Radeon 660M<br><strong>Dedicated:</strong><br>■ NVIDIA GTX 900 Series<br>■ AMD Radeon 400 Series<br>■ Intel Arc A-Series<br><strong>Deprecation notice: Support for Vulkan 1.3 will be required in the future.</strong><br><strong><br>● Storage:</strong> SSD with 20 GB of free space</p><p><strong>● Network</strong>: 8 Mbit/s connection for multiplayer (UDP/QUIC compatible)</p></div>



<h3 id="h-storage-requirements">Storage Requirements</h3>



<div><p>Hytale procedurally generates a world that can, in practice, grow without a fixed limit. Based on extensive playtime in exploration mode, we found these numbers to be representative of a normal playthrough. Keep in mind: the more you explore, customize, and build with a wide variety of blocks, the more memory and storage the game will require.</p><p>● Installation size: 8 GB<br>● Saved game size (in Exploration mode):<br>○ ~661 MB for 5000×5000 blocks<br>○ ~27 KB per 32×32 chunk</p></div>



<h3 id="h-recording-streamer-requirements-1440p-60-fps">Recording / Streamer Requirements (1440p @ 60 FPS)</h3>



<div><p>For players who want to record, stream, or produce Hytale content with stable framerates during high-bitrate capture. The goal here is not raw FPS but consistent frametime under heavy load (large battles, complex builds, high view distance, simultaneous server simulation if in singleplayer).</p><p><strong>Suggested Setup</strong><br><strong><br></strong>● <strong>OS: </strong>64-bit Windows 10 (version 1809), Windows 11</p><p>● <strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core i7-10700K (or equivalent), AMD Ryzen 9 3800X (or equivalent)</p><p>● <strong>RAM: </strong>32 GB</p><p>●<strong> GPU:</strong><br>○ NVIDIA RTX 30 Series<br>○ AMD Radeon RX 7000 Series<br>○ Intel Arc A-series</p><p><em>Note: These recommendations are made as newer graphics cards provide much better video quality for a given bitrate, especially for livestreaming scenarios. If supported, we also strongly recommend the use of AV1 / HEVC for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>● <strong>Storage:</strong><br>○ NVMe SSD with at least 10% (or 50 GB) of free space available.<br><em>Note: For best performance, we recommend using a separate drive for video recording.</em><br><em><br></em>One internal benchmark (AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, NVIDIA RTX 5080, 2×32 GB DDR5-6000) sustained around 400 FPS at 3840×1440 resolution with view distance set to 768 blocks in singleplayer while recording the game in AV1. This tier is optional but helpful for creators who want stable 60+ FPS at high resolutions during recording sessions.</p></div>

                <p>In the 21 years since World of Warcraft launched, one feature has been asked about and requested above all others: player housing. Despite being the premier MMORPG for over two decades, housing in WoW has always felt like a pipedream. Now, that dream is finally a reality, as an early-access version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/">player housing is launching December 2</a> for those who preorder WoW's eleventh expansion, Midnight.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a long time coming. Housing as a feature was experimented with in WoW's earliest days but never came to fruition. In 2014, WoW's Warlords of Draenor expansion gave players a taste of what a full-fledged player housing system could be in the form of Garrisons. These large, base-like personal towns met nearly all of a player's needs in one location.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But Garrisons quickly became more of a lesson in what Blizzard shouldn't do when it came to player housing. Barely customizable, Garrisons were also extremely isolating. With access to so many amenities in one, private location, players didn't need to be out in the world or hanging out in one of WoW's capital cities. Garrisons whetted players appetites for housing, but whenever Blizzard was asked about when a proper housing system might arrive, it always replied that it wanted to do the feature justice and was waiting for the right moment to make it happen.</p><p dir="ltr">That time is, at long last, now. Blizzard is hoping to not only avoid the pitfalls of Garrisons but also those of other MMOs with its take on virtual-home ownership. Ahead of housing's early-access launch on December 2 as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch, GameSpot had the chance to sit down with WoW housing principal game designer Jesse Kurlancheek and housing senior UX designer Joanna Gianulis to discuss what it's like to work on the most-anticipated feature in WoW history and the philosophy behind Blizzard's approach. We also dive into aspects of Blizzard's housing plans that players have some concerns about, like why Blizzard opted to tie a progression system to housing and why it thinks a controversial new premium currency used to buy housing items on the game's shop is necessary.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A Home For Everyone</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">WoW hasn't stopped being the top MMO on the block since its release in 2004, but plenty of its rivals beat it to the punch when it came to housing. Games like Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn, The Elder Scrolls Online, New World, and even Old School RuneScape all have their own take on player housing.</p><p dir="ltr">While every game approaches housing differently, WoW's version of the feature immediately differentiates itself in one, huge way--everyone who wants a house can easily get one. In FF14, houses are costly and limited in number, with players having to enter a lottery for the chance to buy one. Snagging a starter home (or rather, a starter room) in ESO is fairly easy, but a larger apartment, house, or mansion will cost players significantly more. The same applies in New World, where owners additionally have to pay taxes on their virtual real estate, lest they lose access to housing bonuses, the ability to decorate, or invite others to their digital homestead. In Old School RuneScape, houses cost money depending on the location, with additional rooms costing even more.</p><p dir="ltr">By comparison, a house in WoW costs a measly 1,000 gold to purchase. That may have been a pretty penny back in the vanilla WoW days, but in 2025, players can easily snag close to 1,000 gold from a single World Quest. Houses are, effectively, free.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, size doesn't matter in Azeroth (at least when it comes to houses). Homes all cost the same, regardless of where they are located in the housing neighborhood or what they look like on the outside. On the inside, players can have a small, single room or a lavish, multistory mansion. It's all up to players, and it's all the same price (though furnishing a massive home is another story entirely). If someone has already built a house in a spot coveted by another player, they can simply travel to another neighborhood where that housing plot is open. There is no scarcity or competition here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614050" data-ratio="0.56236559139785" data-width="1860" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614050"></a><figcaption>Razorwind Shores is the zone where Horde players will get to build their homes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614050-wowmidnighthordehousing.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Making a house easily available to every player who wanted one was always the goal from the very earliest design pitches for the modern incarnation of WoW housing, Kurlancheek said, so much so that it was the first bullet point on the first slide of the initial pitch presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea that someone who has been playing WoW for 21 years, who has thought of Azeroth as their home for that amount of time, to not have a home, just felt so wrong," Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Even attaching a 100,000 gold cost, a reasonable price tag for most longtime WoW players, could result in some newer players having to farm gold, something Kurlancheek said wouldn't "feel good." Blizzard didn't want to translate the stress of real home ownership, with taxes and mortgage payments, into Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't want to take chores from the real world and suffuse my online gaming with them," Kurlandcheek said. "That sort of accessibility, availability, of this new major pillar of WoW, it was really important for us to give everyone a shot."</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Becoming A Housing Main</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Aside from making it available to every player, Blizzard also knew housing needed to scale to all types of players, from those content with having a one-room home with a table and a few chairs all the way to players who want to spend dozens of hours a week working on their dream mansion.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/">housing system's decorating tools</a> allow for both extremes. On the surface, decorating one's home can be extremely straightforward, with the ability to snap items and decorations to a grid using the basic decorating mode and call it a day. But for those who want to get into the nitty-gritty details, an advanced mode allows for all kinds of precision tools, like the ability to turn off object collision and resize and rotate items as players see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">"We worked really, really hard to get basic mode as comprehensive as we could and work as well as we could…but we ended up really wanting to add in the advanced mode for players who wanted to take that step and go that extra level," Gianulis said. "And we're all glad that we did."</p><p dir="ltr">The results already speak for themselves. Even in the Midnight alpha and beta, players wasted no time putting the housing decorating system through its paces, creating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqeOW4Jjwos">feats of home engineering</a> that prove just how powerful Blizzard's tools can be in the right creative hands.</p><p dir="ltr">Striking that balance, of catering both to the players who may become housing "mains" and those who use it more casually, was a challenge, Gianulis said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We know a lot of WoW players, this is the game they play and they maybe haven't played other housing games," Gianulis said. "It should feel good to them, it should feel natural. They shouldn't have to learn how to play this whole new game within a game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614051"></a><figcaption>Concept art for what a Blood Elf-themed room can look like using WoW's housing system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614051-wowmidnighthousingbloodelfconceptart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/">Housing will have a progression system</a> to keep players leveling up their house's capabilities, with players over time unlocking new types of rooms, the option to add more rooms, and the ability to place more decor items within their house. The fact that some of these options have to be unlocked, rather than being available from the start, has been a debated topic among WoW's playerbase, but Kurlancheek said there is logic behind the system.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a fine line there," Kurlancheek said. "On day one, if you came in and literally every option was unlocked from the get go, you have all the space that's possible, it's overwhelming in a lot of ways. You get analysis paralysis…I have 10,000 decor I can place and a house that can have 50 rooms. That's kind of a lot to take in."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have played WoW for decades, they'll likely start with their house level at three or four, with more options and freedom from the get-go, Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We respect that past effort," Kurlancheek said. "But progression is ultimately still important. You still want to unlock the skybox room, unlock the night room, unlock these other aspects of housing. We still want you to have goals."</p><p dir="ltr">Housing is intended as an evergreen pillar of the game going forward, and as such, the house level system will continue to expand in future updates and expansions, Gianulis said.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want it to feel like it's always been a part of the game and always will [be], so that means we're going to be adding maybe more house levels, maybe other things," Gianulis said.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The Hearthsteel Debate</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">If there is one potential pitfall Blizzard may fall into with housing, it's in how it monetizes it. Blizzard was upfront early on with players that it would sell some housing-related items (though the majority of housing items are earnable in-game) on the in-game shop. This was expected. Blizzard has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/">sold various mounts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-cosmetic-bundle-comes-with-a-whopping-100-transmog-items/1100-6534786/">cosmetic items for real money on WoW's in-game shop</a> for over a decade at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">What wasn't known until more recently, however, was that those housing items would only be purchasable with a new premium currency called Hearthsteel. After a datamine revealed the currency, Blizzard attempted to explain its reasoning in an ill-received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/">blog post that attempted to justify the need for a premium currency</a> (something typically associated with mobile or free-to-play games, of which WoW is neither). The blog post stated that the use of Hearthsteel would make purchasing multiple, inexpensive items more "efficient" and that bundles of Hearthsteel available for purchase would align with item costs in a "player-friendly way."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4614052"></a><figcaption>Players can preview premium housing items that cost Hearthsteel in the decorating interface.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4614052-wowhousinghearthsteelinterface.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Feedback to Hearthsteel has been largely negative, threatening to dampen the excitement surrounding the arrival of WoW's most-requested feature. When asked to further explain the need for Hearthsteel, and if Blizzard would be looking to rethink its approach, Kurlancheek echoed many of the blog post's points.</p><p dir="ltr">He said the currency was needed for convenience, as the Battle.net shop doesn't have a shopping cart feature to batch together multiple small purchases into one transaction. He also said there are "regulatory hurdles" Blizzard has to be mindful of when it comes to real-money purchases. Using Hearthsteel allows Blizzard to more easily issue refunds, as an example, instead of making players jump through hoops to return a chair they didn't like.</p><p dir="ltr">He said that Blizzard is attempting to be as "player friendly as possible" by aligning Hearthsteel amounts with item prices so that players won't have awkward amounts of currency left over or feel the need to strategically buy bundles in order to get the correct amount of currency.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's all been in service of making this a good experience for players," Kurlancheek said.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the need from Hearthsteel stems from the need to make multiple, small transactions more convenient, Kurlancheek said. When asked if players could instead pay a higher price to gain multiple, or even unlimited, uses of an item (as opposed to only being able to buy them one at a time), and thus eliminate the need for a virtual currency, Kurlancheek said he believed it would result in "inflated prices we don't feel good about charging."</p><p dir="ltr">It didn't sound like players should expect changes to Hearthsteel when housing launches, but Kurlancheek didn't close the door entirely on the subject.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think everything in housing is an iterative process," Kurlancheek said. "We listen to the feedback, we see what players are clamoring for, what's not working for them, what's causing friction, and so on, and I don't think the shop is any different."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not Hearthsteel will see changes, it's clear that the arrival of housing signals a new era for WoW, in more ways than one. Only time will tell how housing will evolve over time, but it's clear Blizzard has crafted a solid base for the feature to be built upon in the months and years to come, even if Hearthsteel could potentially become a major crack in housing's foundation.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW players who preorder Midnight can buy their home starting on December 2, and Blizzard has released a step-by-step housing guide for those looking to get started as soon as possible. The patch will also introduce a prologue questline for the next expansion and a revamped new-and-returning-player experience. As for Midnight proper, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion was recently revealed to be launching on March 2, 2026</a>.</p>

One of which happens to be Nintendo's very own Shigeru Miyamoto, which former Rare designer and director Gregg Mayles revealed <a href="https://x.com/Ghoulyboy/status/1995198826211340653">on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Sharing a fax from the legendary game creator and director (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/12/former-rare-designer-reveals-what-shigeru-miyamoto-thought-of-banjo-kazooies-n64-sequel">Time Extension</a>!), Mayles says "Nice of him that compliment (in my mind anyway)" before explaining just what a fax is — to those youngsters online, of course.</p>
<p>The fax itself is a written notice of approval of the final rom of Banjo-Tooie, the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, with an additional note hand-written by Miyamoto in English which says "splendid game" with a little thumbs up and smiley face.</p><div><figure data-videoid="U-42JOukqJg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU-42JOukqJg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-42JOukqJg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4af2b0gnlrtp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>It's a cute little piece of history, and the timing is pretty perfect too — the game just celebrated its 25th birthday a few weeks ago, and we too (read: this writer) have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-banjo-tooie-is-pure-nightmare-fuel-and-i-wouldnt-have-it-any-other-way">fond memories of the follow-up</a>, which takes a bit of a darker, bigger turn.</p>
<p>Mayles left Rare earlier this year following a number of layoffs at Microsoft and the cancellation of Everwild. Back in October, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/banjo-kazooie-director-marks-departure-from-rare-with-a-poem">developer shared a poem on his final day at the studio</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the holiday season once again, and what better way to spend time with family and friends than with a brand new <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/beat-em-up" rel="nofollow">beat 'em up</a>?&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s got you covered. From <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/tribute-games" rel="nofollow">the team</a> that brought you the excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review" rel="nofollow"><em>TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em>'<em>s Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;is a blast from start to finish, and it doesn't hurt that it also has a bunch of iconic characters we know and love.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-roster.jpg?itok=QdrccdK3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-roster.jpg?itok=Sd6w-fQ- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some characters you'll have to unlock by playing the campaign.</figcaption></figure><h2>Avengers, X-Men, and Others Too!</h2>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s a beat 'em up, so you already sort of know what you're getting into. It's not the most complex genre ever, that's for sure, but it's usually one that provides a great deal of fun, especially with friends. As with any beat 'em up, my favorite part is the roster, and this game has it in spades.</p>

<p>What helps&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;stand apart from the pack is its cast of characters -- and it's a large one, for sure. 15 total characters to choose from makes the variety almost overwhelming, but it's exciting to see a bunch of iconic characters (and some more niche ones) make an appearance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-phyla-vell.jpg?itok=9ahtHidd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-phyla-vell.jpg?itok=zmed1MLw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Phyla-Vell is cool as hell though!</figcaption></figure><p>You have fan favorites like Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Captain America, of course, but other not-so-obvious picks like She-Hulk (instead of Hulk), Cosmic Ghost Rider (instead of regular Ghost Rider, I guess?), and even Nova.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Marvel-head, but I enjoy the character designs and their powers, so forgive me for not knowing who the hell, uhhhh, Beta Ray Bill is? And Phyla-Vell? These fringe choices, at least from a casual Marvel fan's perspective, are intriguing and make the roster all the more intriguing.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-combat.jpg?itok=h7u77tPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-combat.jpg?itok=FIOhwJKm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting alien worms is just another day for the Avengers.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Many Moves of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>'s Diverse Roster</h2>

<p>When you're ready to start the campaign or run through the classic-styled Arcade mode, you choose not one but&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;characters, which is another area where&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>stands out. In combat, you're able to switch between two characters tag-team style. You can even call the benched character in for assists during combat.</p>

<p>Developer Tribute Games does a fine job at keeping characters distinct from one another in not just looks but in terms of gameplay, and move-sets are&nbsp;<em>mostly</em>&nbsp;unique, though some characters share similarities with each other.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-flight.jpg?itok=i_V3nKjF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-flight.jpg?itok=uGywcV5n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oh yeah, CRT filter!</figcaption></figure><p>For example, some characters have the ability to fly and float around the stage -- I'd say roughly half the roster -- while the rest are grounded. Some characters can dodge, while others block. Blocking, by the way, seems way more useful than dodges since blocking at the right time can parry, so I wish dodges felt equally useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even still, when you consider the combination of teams with a roster of 15 different heroes, each run has the potential to be quite different since there are 105 combinations in total. Throw in some friends with their own choice of two characters, and the variety here is quite impressive.</p>

<p>Let's dive into some characters and how they play specifically, because that's the bread and butter of<em>&nbsp;</em>beat 'em ups. I often chose Captain America because, weirdly enough, he felt the closest to your traditional brawler-type character from most beat 'em ups.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-captain-america.jpg?itok=NsgaxJ9D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-captain-america.jpg?itok=aA9LCkCo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Captain America is looking at him like "You call that a workout?"</figcaption></figure><p>Each character has a special ability, so Cap can throw his shield across the screen to hit enemies. His combos are really straightforward and punchy, and his rising attack opens up the ability for some good air combos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there's Wolverine, and he's an absolute monster. Tribute captured the feel of Wolverine to a tee with his fast-moving, vicious attacks and the ability to latch onto enemies and plunge his claws into them.</p>

<p>Some characters I didn't enjoy purely because they didn't fit my playstyle, but I still had fun with the entire cast. She-Hulk was a total surprise, since I expected a big, punchy character like her male counterpart. She-Hulk is actually a bona fide grappler, with short-ranged wrestling moves and a few grabs as her special moves that throw enemies around the stage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-worm-race.jpg?itok=KzuMnT23 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-worm-race.jpg?itok=i7qp1iHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Slug racing.</figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, each character in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;has a passive you gain as you level them up (like&nbsp;<em>Shredder</em>'<em>s Revenge</em>). These usually relate to a character thematically, so Wolverine uses his mutant healing powers to slowly regain health.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a character like Rocket Raccoon has a grenade ability that changes depending on RNG. He also has a very powerful nuke grenade. With his passive, defeating enemies in a combo increases the chances of the nuke grenade coming up, so it's a passive that rewards skill and keeping your combos up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-she-hulk-and-rocket.jpg?itok=CaccH1Dg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-she-hulk-and-rocket.jpg?itok=ZOL196VW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An unlikely duo.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tag Team Time</h2>

<p>At this point, I feel like I've only scraped the surface. Characters also have a charge attack, used by holding down the standard attack button. These come in the form of additional projectiles, parries, gap closers, and more. For example, Spider-Man pulls in enemies from afar with his web by charging, closing the gap without actually having to run across the screen.</p>

<p>Each character has a dash attack, and one interesting thing my co-op partner found with these is that they can be animation-cancelled. Beta Ray Bill can fly forward hammer-first, and this can be spammed to cause absolute chaos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, each character also has a special that taps into a Focus gauge accrued while fighting. These are what you'd expect -- powerful, screen-clearing attacks that do big damage. Some feel better than others, though. Iron Man's special shoots across the screen and does big damage, while Rocket's, though powerful, requires you to be a bit closer to enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-tag-team.jpg?itok=NflOW-rG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-tag-team.jpg?itok=6jS9Bcav 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tagging in Nova for some support!</figcaption></figure><p>This is all for individual characters, but consider that you have to choose two heroes from the roster. As I said, there's a bit of a tag-team element in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, so you can switch between characters on the fly. Each has their own Focus bar, so you can use two specials simultaneously if you want.</p>

<p>Similarly, a character's health is their own, so even if one hero dies, you can use the other. The main advantage of this system is calling in your second hero to assist in combos. For example, you can have your benched hero use their special while you're mid-combo with the other.</p>

<p>The assist system is more than just pressing a button, as there are a few options in addition to the combo assist. You can launch an enemy into the air and swap to your other character -- this is called a Launcher Cosmic Swap. The assist system adds another layer to the gameplay that few other beat 'ups have, so it's great to see this here.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-dinosuars.jpg?itok=Y_F6MjDV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-dinosuars.jpg?itok=f3749AL4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Isn't this pterodactyl the dude that doesn't want to cure cancer, he just wants to turn people into dinosaurs?</figcaption></figure><h2>A Quest Across the Cosmos</h2>

<p>For now, let's set characters and their specifics aside. There's a whole campaign here, and each level offers up a different theme within the Marvel universe. New York, with references to Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle, is the first level we see. As things go on, levels take us to some pretty wild locales.</p>

<p>Wakanda, sure, that's in Africa, but nothing we haven't seen before. We're going to different realms like Valhalla and fighting across the stars. The story was a bit hard to follow as a casual fan, and having dialogue in the middle of gameplay doesn't help. Even still, it was cool to see what the next stage would be.</p>

<p>The sprite work for these stages is almost distractingly beautiful; seriously, Tribute's pixel artists are an impressive bunch. Still, I wish levels had more gimmicks or some hook to make them more exciting beyond looking pretty. Most gimmicks are just annoying hazards, lava geysers, or projectiles from afar.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-avenger-ship-spiderman-and-venom.jpg?itok=O8x40ihL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-avenger-ship-spiderman-and-venom.jpg?itok=4BwCR6OT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Venom and Spidey fighting side-by-side is a good time.</figcaption></figure><p>The stage featuring Valhalla is actually a super cool one I won't spoil, but beyond that, it didn't feel like stages had enough of a hook for them to stand out. Nonetheless, running through the campaign with a few friends is a blast.</p>

<p>Enemy variety is also adequate, and I don't have much to say about this other than that there's enough to make encounters feel varied. Likewise, bosses are fine. Some of them are way more memorable than others, and one boss in particular felt like a letdown considering they are one of the most feared villains in the entire Marvel universe.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the last boss is one of the weakest in terms of design -- probably the least memorable, too. They're bulky and have a lot of health, but I expected them to have more abilities or&nbsp;<em>something</em>&nbsp;since they were, you know, the very last fight.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-matrix.jpg?itok=OLviMNu0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-cosmic-invasion-matrix.jpg?itok=7_xIM7UH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Unlocking stuff on the matrix kind of reminds me of <em>Smash Bros Brawl'</em>s unlock grid.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Gripes aside, there are plenty of ways to replay&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion.&nbsp;</em>I'm waiting for a good time to have friends together so we can play Arcade mode, which has a bunch of modifiers you can use to make things more difficult. As an example, you can play solo but fight the same amount of enemies four players would, double enemies' health, and much more.</p>

<p>There are also a handful of challenges to complete in the campaign, usually involving specific characters. These are usually quite simple, but it's another thing for completionists to tackle. Completing these allows you to unlock more nodes on the "Cosmic Matrix," which features new skins, lore entries, arcade mode modifiers, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All-in-all,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is an exciting and enjoyable time. It throws in a few twists with the tag-team system and its large roster, and it looks amazing as well. It offers all that you'd want in a beat 'em up, and even if it isn't perfect, bring a few friends along for the ride, turn your brain off, and fight like heroes.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2024) </a>last year, including the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ed2ad5c2-7b7b-4a5a-84ff-eb15f1121885" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow">PHB </a>and what would be the new base character options, the one class omitted was that of the Artificer. A class that harnesses a mixture of technology and magic to create new wonders. With the release of <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> now only this class is now only back with a 2024 coat of paint, but new spells, species, and Eberron-specific mechanics have been detailed.</p>

<h2>2024 D&amp;D Artificer</h2>

<p>The D&amp;D 2024 Artificer carries with it a few changes and is still of a comparable difficulty to run as it was in 2014.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-artificer.jpg?itok=tV2G5-AH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-artificer.jpg?itok=ju6JTXML 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As expected from the change between 2014's Artificer and 2024 Artificer, there are some differences, but for the most part, the change comes with a different rate of leveling up and with some naming differences. For example, the 2014 Artificer has Infuse Item, where the 2024 Artificer has Replicate Magic Item, but the effects of the ability are essentially the same, with some minor tweaks.</p>

<p>The Sub-Classes available to the 2024 D&amp;D Artificer are:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Alchemist </strong>- Craft Magic Elixers and Potions</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Armorer </strong>- Craft Magic Armor to Enhance Your Abilities</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Artillerist </strong>- Wield Destructive Power from Afar</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Battlesmith </strong>- Command a Construct Guardian</li>
	<li aria-level="1">And the new class, <strong>Cartographer </strong>- Chart Advantageous Courses through Turmoil</li>
</ul><p>The Alchemist subclass has a focus on the creation of potions that can buff allies. On top of that, you can gain a bonus to healing spells, or spells that deal Acid, Fire, or Poison Damage. At higher levels, you also add Force Damage.</p>

<p>The Armorer lets you wear heavy armor and turn your normal armor into Arcane Armor of three different varieties: Dreadnought, Guardian, and Infiltrator, each with their own special abilities. At higher levels, the abilities that these suits of armor have also improved.</p>

<p>The Artillerist is all about attacking from afar with a powerful cannon. At higher levels, you can also increase the power of this cannon and cause it to detonate ,dealing even more damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-artificer-subclasses.jpg?itok=lWuP-pfg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-artificer-subclasses.jpg?itok=i5S1K4P2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Battlesmith lets you create a Steel Defender, a companion of steel that will aid you in battle. Initially, you need to take a Bonus Action to command your Steel Defender to attack, but once you obtain Extra Attack at level 5, you can use your second attack to use the Steel Defender's Force-Empowered Rand action.</p>

<p>The new class, the Cartographer, focuses heavily on creating magical maps that you can share with your party. The recipients of these maps (1+ Intelligence Modifier) will get to add 1d4 to their initiative rolls, and they'll innately know the locations of the other map holders while in the same place.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Cartographer gets Faerie Fire that can be cast as many times os their Int modifier, and they can teleport short range anywhere or 30 feet to someone with a map.</p>

<p>It's a really fun and involved form of a support and protection class. At first, potentially only being able to cover and assist part of the party as the sub-classes' abilities grow it will be able to add protection to all of the party.</p>

<h2>New And Updates Species</h2>

<p>This sourcebook brings with it information for the Changeling, Kalashtar, and Shifter species.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-khoravar-species.jpg?itok=rZcIv1aZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-khoravar-species.jpg?itok=9IU2TNfd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the most part, there are minimal differences between the 2014 edition of these 'races' and the 2024 species. Interestingly for the Changeling, who got a revision in <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dc04fb34-c3df-4c25-a8d3-8a522fcb6796" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mordenkainen-presents-monsters-of-multiverse-review" rel="nofollow">Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse</a></em>, the main difference is that a Changeling now has Advantage on Charisma checks when shape-shifted.</p>

<p>The Kalashtar obtains an additional advantage to Charisma Saving Throws alongside the Wisdom saving throws it already had as part of Dual Mind. It's much the same for the Shifter and Warforged.</p>

<p>The new race added in <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> is the Khoravar. This is a species descended from both humans and elves. It's an in-universe way of saying "children of Khorvaire", the city that the species descended from, as the people aren't a fan of Half-Elf.</p>

<p>Like most Elf-based species, you'll get Darkvision, Advantage to not be Charmed, a cantrip from the Cleric, Druid, or Wizard spell-list, a resistance to being Unconscious, and the ability to alter a proficiency with one skill or tool of choice.</p>

<p>There's a lot of versatility and ability to slightly tweak your build from day to day, but there's only so much use you can get out of a single rotating Cantrip or Skill.</p>

<p>While the book directs readers back to the previous <em>Eberron </em>book for learning more about the setting, there is the Noir Detective theme of a Sharn Inquisitives campaign that is discussed in this book. This group, described as 'part private investigator, part police detective, and part spy' is a way to recreate hard-boiled detective stories in a D&amp;D setting.</p>

<p>While there isn't any pre-written campaign, the book does a good job of describing different ways that these detective stories can be approached, as well as an extremely broad approach to how you could create a story that is fitting for the adventure. There are guidelines for how to handle adventures at Lv 1-4, Lv 5-10, Lv 11-16, and Lv 17-20. Each is only a paragraph long, it gives the broad strokes that you can then fill in the many blanks for.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-dragonmarked-house.jpg?itok=D53uln15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-dragonmarked-house.jpg?itok=5n0olmlu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This feels a lot like the different levels of adventure creation that the recent <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cb3f917-f831-4c81-8cb8-54e040b09040" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Forgotten Realms</em></a> book has, with a mix of full adventures and single-page stories for the DM to use as a foundation to then grow from. It seems like a nice balance to allow there to be some level of 'adventure' in a book, without needing to create an entirely curated experience from start to finish. This approach is only helpful for DM who prefer to fill in those blanks, but that it's even present can help prompt the creative thinking.</p>

<p>If Noir Detective stories aren't your thing the book also has a similar section to prompt for stories about tense house conflict between the Dragonmarked with references to The Sopranos and Succession, and Morgrave Expeditions which leans into Indiana Jones and Lara Croft style adventures.</p>

<p>In addition to some added information about the world of Eberron this book also expands upon the Dragonmark feats and how they intertwine into the world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Mark of Healing, for example, has given the halflings of House Jorasco an edge in providing medical care; the house has exploited that edge to the point where it remains virtually the only provider of healing services.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To maintain the story tied to these feat they're part of the Backgrounds available to the world of Eberron. You can pick to be an heir to the Cannith house, Ghallanda house, Orien house or more. This is a fantastic way to pair more gameplay elements to a background that is being chosen, as it also adds the opportunity for a character in a non-Eberron setting to be able to obtain a Dragonmark in a different way and minimal tweaking needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Bastion's And Airships</h2>

<p>As a world of Steampunk High-Fantasy it makes sense that it's the next place that we see an update to Bastions, a type of base for the players to build that was introduced in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">Dungeon Master's Guide</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-mobile-bastion.jpg?itok=SCcPTf-I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-forge-of-the-artificer-mobile-bastion.jpg?itok=YaEMirzn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bastion's in <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em> introduce the idea of a Mobile Bastion where one of it's special facilities allows for propulsion. New special facilities have been added that are specific to Eberron like creating areas specifically related to the party's relationship with any of the major houses, and new forges.</p>

<p>Alongside Bastion's that can take you around the world there is also expanded resources about Airships, how they handle, and how to best tackle combat. There's a lot of information here about the different types of Airships, what kind of crew is needed to man them, and how to fix them up when things go wrong.</p>

<p>All of the information here is laid out fantastically to be able to quickly process it. Quick stats like AC, HP, Crew members, and speed are coupled with detailed maps showing the different floors, and a quick summary to let you know their best use.</p>

<p>When it comes up in your story you'll be happy to have all of this information at your fingerprints to create a unique adventure or combat opportunity for your parties.</p>

<p>Normally, it's easy to say if a book is worth it or not based on the contents of the player options. With <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer,</em> you aren't just getting new sub-classes but this is the introduction to the Artificer class for D&amp;D 2024. It's definitely worth picking up if you know an Artificer is going to be rolled up for your table.</p>

<p>That being said, a lot of the changes are very minor tweaks, things that might not entirely seem worth it for the price of a new book.</p>

<p>The Cartographer is a very fun concept, leaning into passive support for all party members and a quick application of Faerie Fire. I can imagine a DM getting very tired of being rolled against with advantage when played correctly, even more frustrating when it teleports all over the place.</p>

<p>For the DM there's good info on running a detective, mob family, or dungeon delving campaign. There's also options for mobile bastions and airships but if you're not running a campaign explicitly in Eberron, then these are less important to have.</p>

<p>If you're running a campaign in Eberron, or your next character is an Artificer, then you should pick up this book, otherwise it likely isn't worth it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178</link>
            <guid>1369528</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After nearly a decade, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-trailer-teaser-netflix-1851786407"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a> <span>is in its fifth and final season, and the Netflix series about kids fighting evil monsters is still dripping with ‘80s nostalgia. This includes a scene where a kid is playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins</span></i><span>, the classic NES platformer from 1985, on his NES. To most, this scene probably didn’t raise any red flags, but for eagle-eyed retro fans, this is a pretty glaring error from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, whose whole shtick has been ‘80s references since the first season aired when Barack Obama was still president.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Derek Turnbow, a new character in season five, seems to be playing </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>on an NES, the game that appears on his television is actually the arcade version. Retro-focused outlet </span><a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/11/random-did-you-spot-this-nes-related-blunder-in-stranger-things-season-5"><i><span>Time Extension</span></i></a><span> points out the details that reveal this, like the big black borders shown on the screen. On the console, these black bars were nowhere to be seen. The arcade version uses these bars to show text overlays with the player’s score. The console version, meanwhile, just puts this information on top of the gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The error is all the more baffling because the set dressing has everything </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>needs to just play the NES version. There’s an actual Nintendo Entertainment System plugged into a TV, with the original </span><i><span>Ghost ‘n Goblins </span></i><span>cartridge inside, and yet, someone at Netflix used footage of the arcade version in the final episode. Retro fans are feeling some type of way about it.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I wasn’t born during this decade and didn’t play it until years after I was born, […] but even I know what the game looks like on there,” PrivateLiker7625 </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1p9idys/how_the_heck_did_they_mess_up_something_as_simple/"><span>wrote on Reddit</span></a><span>. “Talk about an insult to the intelligence of those that grew up on this!”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder,” dropthefunk </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StrangerThings/comments/1p8aaxr/the_wrong_version_of_ghosts_n_goblins_is_shown_on/"><span>wrote in another thread</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love Stranger Things, but Season 5 just committed a cardinal sin. They show a kid playing ‘Nintendo’ in his room… but the TV is clearly running the arcade version of Ghosts ’n Goblins, NOT the NES port. My retro heart can’t take it! 😫 <a href="https://t.co/LRZJOOjCTM">pic.twitter.com/LRZJOOjCTM</a></p> <p>— My Retro Life (@myretrolifeshow) <a href="https://twitter.com/myretrolifeshow/status/1994560916118278169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While the call for someone to lose their job is a bit extreme, it is an odd oversight considering all the ingredients for an accurate shot are seemingly in the room. Though the show is usually pretty consistent with its nostalgic callbacks, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>isn’t immune to </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/goofs/"><span>continuity errors</span></a><span>, with most of them typically being in using imagery and products that wouldn’t have existed in the show’s ‘80s setting.</span></p>

<p>Fortnite devs revealed in a new post that the Chapter 7 launch featured 10.5 million players and over 3 million tuned in across livestream platforms. </p>



<p>Chapter 7 Season 1 for Fortnite is already live, introducing players to a brand new island where the battle bus has been destroyed, and players have been tasked to collect the missing parts. Before Chapter 7 launched, Fortnite held a Zero Hour event that brought swarms of players to the title. </p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-7-launch-had-over-3-million-players-tuned-in">Fortnite Chapter 7 Launch Had Over 3 Million Players Tuned In</h2>



<p>The announcement of the new player stats comes from Fortnite’s post on <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1994855116869116102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). The post states, “Absolute Cinema: 10.5M of you joined us in-game for Zero Hour, and 3M+ tuned in across livestream platforms!” Fortnite’s Chapter 6 Zero Hour event, bringing millions of players, wasn’t a surprise as it featured a jam-packed event filled with collaborations. We also saw the likes of Playboi Carti, Hatsune Miku, and more. The end also featured an Avengers: Endgame type of event, where so many past collabs of Fortnite returned.</p>



<p>For those wondering about the new chapter, Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 introduced a brand new map called Golden Coast. You have to reach this map by using Storm Surf, as the Battle Bus is out of commission. The update also introduced new gameplay features, including the addition of self-revive, drivable reboot vans, turning into bosses, and more. </p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is reportedly looking to add a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-getting-gulag-mechanic-similar-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone-style Gulag mechanic</a>. Fortnite featured Quentin Tarantino’s ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-to-feature-quentin-tarantinos-dream-kill-bill-chapter-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dream’ Kill Bill chapter</a> last month.

<p>GTA 6 has the eyes of the world on it, from players to developers and publishers. It’s the biggest video game ever, and there’s no doubt about this. It’s been two years since Rockstar Games dropped a sacred piece of history on our laps with the GTA 6 reveal trailer, and no one’s been the same since.</p>



<p>The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> trailer debuted nearly two years to the day on December 5. Rockstar actually announced the trailer’s launch several days in advance, and it meant that everyone was locked in. We’re coming up to the trailer’s second anniversary, and it’s a moment of reflection on a long journey.</p>







<h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-1-turns-2-in-december">GTA 6 Trailer 1 Turns 2 In December</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Our time will all come. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s every chance Rockstar Games was going to drop GTA 6’s first trailer without warning. However, a leak beforehand forced Rockstar’s hand, and the company revealed the first trailer’s date in advance.</p>







<p>Vice City has never looked better than it did in Trailer 1. We also got our first glimpse into the mysterious new characters of Lucia and Jason. Eventually, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-2-is-live-featuring-jason-and-lucia/">GTA Trailer 2</a> <em>was </em>shadow-dropped, but it’s been two years since the record-breaking first trailer, and it’s incredible how little has been shown from the full game since—such as any discernible, official gameplay footage (not the leaks). </p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-1-allegedly-becomes-number-one-youtube-trailer-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6 Trailer 1 allegedly became the number one YouTube trailer of all time</a>.</p>



<p>We continue to wait for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-3-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6 Trailer 3</a>, and it’s amazing how ravenous the community becomes when so much as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-video-in-development-grand-theft-auto-rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short in-development video of GTA 6</a> appears online!</p>



<p>The latest GTA 6 delay means it’ll be close to three years since Trailer 1 was announced. If you fancy a quick reminder of what’s coming, or feel a mini-wave of nostalgia close to Christmas, check out Grand Theft Auto 6’s reveal trailer here.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review</link>
            <guid>1369519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Depending on who you talk to, beat ‘em ups are either repetitive, button-mashy coin munchers or a deceptively simple vehicle for absolute combat mastery. Me? I’m in the latter camp. But how do you get people who aren’t sickos like myself interested? How do you lure them into taking the first steps down Sicko Road? This year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-review"><u>Absolum</u></a> tried by merging a mechanically excellent beat ‘em up with a middling roguelite. Marvel Cosmic Invasion developer Tribute Games – the cats behind Shredder’s Revenge, the best TMNT game since Turtles in Time– takes a different approach. It looks to the Marvel vs. Capcom fighting games of old and asks one of the boldest questions I’ve seen a beat ‘em up pose in a New York minute: what if it was a tag game where you controlled multiple heroes? The answer, as it turns it, rules, even if the actual execution of Cosmic Invasion doesn’t quite live up to that concept.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll be real with y’all; I’m not a Marvel guy. My dad’s into comics, and he got me into them, but DC was always his bag (he owns every Wonder Woman comic ever published, and no, that’s not an exaggeration), so I’m a DC kid at heart with a soft spot for indie comics. But I love the weirder parts of Marvel, especially the million conflicting X-men timelines and the cosmic stuff. It’s not the most popular thing Marvel publishes (that is and always will be Spider-Man, though X-men is no slouch), but it’s the most interesting. Give me that over the MCU stuff any day.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Cosmic Invasion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the title didn’t give it away, that’s what Marvel Cosmic Invasion is about. The story here is real simple, almost like it has been ripped straight from the pages of a multi-issue event series. Big Bad Annihilus’s Annihilation Wave (listen, it’s comic books, okay?) is sweeping the galaxy! All life hangs in the balance! So it’s up to a rag-tag assortment of Marvel heroes, whether Earthborn or cosmic in origin, to bring him down. That’s all you gotta know. And you know what? It works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of it comes down to the team of 15 heroes that Tribute Games has assembled. Yeah, you’ve got the icons, the regulars who absolutely, positively accept-no-substitutes gotta be there. You know the ones: Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Captain America. Then you’ve got cats that were B-listers before the movies elevated them to prominence: Black Panther, Iron Man, Rocket Raccoon, She-Hulk, Nova, Phoenix, Venom. And then there are the weird and wacky inclusions. Thor isn’t here; instead, you get Beta Ray Bill. Real ones know. How do you feel about Cosmic Ghost Rider? Then there’s my girl Phyla-Vell. Oh, and because this is cosmic Marvel, the Silver Surfer is also here, and he is <em>caked up</em>. To the Silver Surfer degenerate at Tribute Games: I see you, and I appreciate you.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everyone looks stunning because the spritework is absolutely gorgeous.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reality is that everyone here looks stunning because the pixel art spritework is absolutely gorgeous. Whether it’s Phyla-Vell’s hair blowing gently in the wind, how Wolverine always looks like a coiled spring, or the subtle transformations that sometimes reveal Eddie Brock beneath the symbiote as Venom, Cosmic Invasion captures the essence of these characters, right down to their voices. Go ahead and watch one the videos on this page, tell me that doesn’t sound exactly like the way Wolverine or Storm or Iron Man sound in your head. True believers, the vibe is immaculate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Structurally, Cosmic Invasion is a pretty standard beat ‘em up. Not counting the tutorial, there are 15 stages, including old Marvel standbys like New York City, Wakanda, the Savage Land, and Genosha, as well as more exotic environs like Fort Galactus, each with a fun little sub-description (Genosha’s is Heavy Metal; the Savage Land’s is Rumble in the Jungle). Stage selection is mostly a straight line, but occasionally the path will split before reconverging and you’ll have to complete both branches before moving on. 
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Levels themselves are good but unremarkable beat ‘em up fare with the occasional environmental hazard. There is a collectible to find to liven things up, as well as three challenges in each stage – two are hero specific, such as defeating a certain number of enemies with a certain character’s special attack, while the final one is related to the stage itself. All of this is good: the challenges encourage you to use new characters and learn the intricacies of each arena, and stages are well-designed, snappy (each one takes around 10-15 minutes), and visually distinct in cool ways – you’d never mistake Savage Lands for Klyntar or Genosha – but nothing here is going to redefine your expectations for what a beat ‘em up can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Cosmic Invasion special is its characters. Up to four people can play Cosmic Invasion at once, each controlling two characters, and it’s impressive how different each character is, even if they might not feel that way at first. Take Nova and Iron Man; sure, both of their unique attacks are ranged energy blasts, but Nova’s can pass through and hit multiple targets at once. Iron Man’s don’t. Nova’s special attack is an energy field that only hits foes at close range, while Iron Man’s giant, Marvel vs. Capcom 2-esque laser can hit anyone standing anywhere on-screen, but it does require you to line up your enemies and aim well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Levels themselves are good but unremarkable beat ‘em up fare.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Rocket is a ranged powerhouse, but his charged heavy attack does massive damage, while Phyla-Vell’s, who is more melee focused, can stun – and no one else has anything like her sword, which she can throw and then teleport to in order to start combos and then keep them going across the screen. Beta Ray Bill and Cap can both throw their weapons, too, but Cap’s shield returns to him automatically; Bill’s will spin in place, potentially juggling anyone unlucky enough to come into contact with it until you manually call it back. Even She-Hulk and Wolverine, both up-close-and-personal bruisers, play differently. Logan is faster and all about chaining long stabby-stab combos together, while Jen is a powerhouse who focuses on short combos that launch her victims into the air for potential follow-ups. They both have grabs, but they operate in very different ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some characters have dodges, while others can block and parry if they time things right, opening up more defensive options. Characters that fly have a much easier time dealing with winged foes than those who don’t, and it’s easier for them to avoid stampedes. Everyone is a <em>little</em> different, and that can have a massive impact on how they play. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s really cool, though, are the tag team elements. You only actively control one character at a time, and you can summon your tag partner for various assists to keep laying on the hurt, opening up cool new offensive possibilities – that could be a launcher, a standard combo, their unique ability, their metered “I want these guys <em>dead</em>” special attack, and so on. Figuring out the best combinations and how movesets interact is a lot of fun, especially since you don’t start with everyone unlocked. It’s possible to lose a character mid-level (they have separate health bars), but even then, all isn’t lost. You continue on with your remaining hero, and if you stumble upon some floor food, a time-honored beat ‘em up tradition, they’ll come back with a little health.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters also level up as you use them, gaining more health, passive abilities, and so on, encouraging you to experiment, especially in co-op. I played the whole game with my wife (a single run through the campaign took three hours), and while I think Cosmic Invasion is a good time solo, like basically every beat ‘em up, it’s better with friends.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Licensed Games</h3><p>A list of the best licensed games unfit to print.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this beat ‘em up has any black eyes, it’s the lack of enemy variety. You’ll see the same core cast of baddies <em>a lot</em> in Cosmic Invasion, and while that’s not a huge problem (this happens in most beat ‘em ups), it can get a little old. It’s also hilariously obvious when you’re fighting a boss that will become a playable character later on because it <em>feels</em> like you’re fighting someone you’ll be able to play later. It can lead to some really funny moments, like when we were fighting the Silver Surfer on an elevator and kept knocking him into the abyss. Eventually, he’d levitate back up to us for more, only to get knocked down again. It wasn’t bad, but it was as goofy as Rob Liefeld-drawn feet or pouches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you get bored of beating on Annihilus’s minions, you can head to the Vault, where you can see each hero’s progress in the Hero Lab, learn about their history and the history of your foes in the Nova Corps Files, and listen to some of Cosmic Invasion’s excellent tracks. You can also spend Cosmic Cubes you earn to unlock nodes in the Cosmic Matrix for more color palettes, hero profiles, tunes, and Nova Corps Files. It’s a cool little system, and it even doubles as a neat way to make art if you unlock the right nodes in a way that forms a pattern. I made an adorable little bug, and I’ll miss him when I fill everything out and he’s gone.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The stages themselves aren’t going to blow you away and I wish there was a more varied rogues’ gallery to smack down, but Marvel Cosmic Invasion’s tag team action has the juice, and it’s a joy to dig into each character’s kit, especially in co-op. I don’t think it’s a great beat ‘em up, but it is a very good one that I’m looking forward to playing again in the years to come, and it highlights some of the more obscure (and fun) parts of Marvel’s history. If you’re not already into the genre, I doubt Cosmic Invasion will change your mind, but it’s good enough to get my Avengers assembled on a lazy Sunday, kick back, and pop some baddies in the mouth.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasion-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive is busy working on James Bond video game 007 First Light, but it has said it also has plans to release Hitman 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/hitman-eminem-slim-shady-mission-io-interactive-ceo-interview-1236595901/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, CEO Hakan Abrak said “of course there will be more Hitman.” But it may be some time before Hitman 4 comes out. Abrak said that any talk of a Hitman 4 announcement will have to wait until Hitman co-op arrives in World of Assassination, which continues to enjoy support via DLC from the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So of course there will be more Hitman,” Abrak said. “But right now, I think we need to get to the other side of this year and next year you’ll get more news about Hitman co-op, because I think co-op is a really, really good extension to the universe, and will introduce very interesting mechanics and combinations in World of Assassination. But we will, after that, be talking about the next Hitman — because, of course, there’s going to be a next Hitman.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hitman franchise kicked off in 2000 with Hitman: Codename 47. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin followed in 2002. Hitman: Blood Money came out in 2006, and served as the third game in the original Hitman trilogy. Hitman: Absolution followed in 2012, before Hitman, which acted as the first installment of the World of Assassination trilogy, came out in 2016. Hitman 2 followed in 2018, then Hitman 3 in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IOI has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy. “It’s not announced yet, exactly what it is, but it’s a multiplayer fantasy project, which is extremely ambitious and really cool and is something else than a gun in a suit,” Abrak teased. “So that’s also good to have something new within the creative outlook here.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Hitman 4 have to wait until all three projects are wrapped up? Abrak didn’t say, but you can see why the studio would want to return to the franchise with a brand new sequel: overall, Hitman has had more than 85 million players and over 25 million copies sold. Each more, more than a million people play Hitman, Abrak added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for 007 First Light, that’s due out March 27, 2026 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spring-looks-really-good-007-first-light-dev-sounds-pretty-happy-with-the-gta-6-delay">a release date that looks all the more lucrative now GTA 6 is delayed to November</a>).

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/">Arc Raiders</a> players recently discovered an exploit that allowed them to loot locked rooms without needing a keycard. Naturally, the exploit quickly became popular--and frustrating for players who didn't use it--leading Embark Studios to apply a "hot" fix to this part of the game. If you now decide to cheese your way into one of these treasure rooms, you can now expect a toasty reception inside.</p><p>Using a keycard to access one of these rooms ties into the high-risk, high-reward nature of Arc Raiders, but the exploit essentially bypasses it. Players managed to break into the room, grab valuable gear without worrying about being ambushed, and pick the location clean. This meant that players who unlocked the room properly would find it stripped bare, leading to frustration within the Arc Raiders community.</p><p>To remedy this, Embark Studios made it so that the rooms automatically activate flamethrowers when you glitch into them. Players quickly found out that they would be caught inside this deathtrap, while other players with keycards would discover a room full of loot and a freshly cremated adventurer.</p><p>Arc Raiders has been a big hit since launch, selling millions of copies and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/">hitting a peak player count of 481,966 raiders on Steam</a>. Embark Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-most-op-perk-just-got-nerfed/1100-6536194/">regularly updated Arc Raiders</a>, fine-tuning the gameplay and nerfing overpowered perks.</p><p>"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter unlike any other, a totally unpredictable, immersive, thrilling story generator directed by the community," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">Arc Raiders review</a>.</p>
