            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-driver-tv-series-is-dead-but-other-exciting-projects-are-in-the-works<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The Driver TV series you forgot was happening isn't happening. Announced back in 2021 and initially due to arrive alongside a gamer-focused streaming service called Binge in 2022, the live action series has been scrapped along with the production company behind it.
</p>
<p>Perhaps of greater significance is that the Driver series itself might not be dead, as a Ubisoft spokesperson said that they are "actively working on other exciting projects related to the franchise".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The series' cancellation was spotted by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-yves-guillemot-driver-skull-and-bones">Game File</a>. It's hardly a surprise. Although it was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7smQNfXZ0UFKbZ7w6o8sDO/liveaction-driver-series-coming-to-binge">announced in 2021</a>, no writer, director or star was ever publicly attached to the proposed show.
</p>
<p>Binge, meanwhile, was a startup streaming service targeting gamers that never got off the ground. It was co-founded by someone who unironically has "disrupting tomorrow" as his role on LinkedIn, and the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bingedotcom/posts/">Binge account</a> was posting about Web3 and "Watch-To-Earn" as recently as three months ago.
</p>
<p>There hasn't been a video game in the series since Driver: San Francisco back in 2011. It's one of <em>those</em> seven-out-of-tens: you once again take control of racing driver-turned-cop, Tanner, only now he's in a coma and has the ability to magically possess drivers of different vehicles around an open world city. It's got light and frothy mission design, oodles of character delivered via NPC dialogue, and floaty-coma-man is a better solution to Driver's literal and figurative design dead-ends than having Tanner be able to walk.
</p>
<p>Does "actively working on other exciting projects" mean Ubisoft is making a Driver video game? No. (Does Ubisoft actively making a video game mean they'll ever release it? Also no.) They could be making a pair of trainers with "Driver" written on the side, for all I know. It would be better than nothing if they were, though - and probably better than whatever Binge.com would have produced.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/disney-hack-1tb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-allegedly-suffers-1-1tb-data-hack.926628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/disney-hack-1tb/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Various reports across social media have claimed that Disney has been hacked, with 1.1TB of data being compromised.</p>



<p>According to the group ‘Nullbulge,’ the group has gained access to the company’s internal Slack, in which 1.1TB of data—including unreleased projects, concept arts, login details, and personal details—is said to have been compromised.</p>



<p>There has been no confirmation from the group that the breach is legitimate, except for a screenshot showing various files. Disney has also yet to respond to comments on the alleged breach.</p>



<p>If true, the hack would be yet another company that has been compromised to this extent in the past couple of years. In late 2022, Rockstar Games suffered a similar breach via Slack in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-leaks-online-with-90-gameplay-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90 videos of GTA 6 were leaked online</a>. In late 2023, Insomniac Games also suffered a devastating breach, which included over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ransomware-group-leaks-over-1-3-million-files-in-insomniac-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million files</a>. </p>



<p>It’s currently unknown to what extent the data has actually been compromised, but if true, we could soon see a flurry of unannounced projects come to light. However, following Nullbulge’s claim, their website has been knocked offline, meaning no one can download the data.</p>



<p>We have reached out to Disney for a comment on the alleged hack.</p>

            <p>Dying Light 2 developer Techland has requested that the majority of staff – including employees who work abroad – come into the office full-time or commit to a "hybrid" model.</p>
<p>The studio says it needs people to come into the office "regularly to foster stronger connections".</p>
<p>According to Polish site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/techland-konczy-z-praca-zdalna-pracownicy-zmiana-wprowadzona-nagle-i-bez-konsultacji">CD-Action</a>, "regularly" equates to eight working days every two months. The outlet also alleges that line managers were given less than 24 hours notice to cascade the news to their direct reports.</p>

<p>Other CD-Action sources claim the studio's current offices are not large enough to accommodate much more than ten percent of its 500 headcount. It's thought around half of those developers had, up until this point, work remotely.</p>
<p>"While remote work remains an option, we're transitioning most roles to either an on-site or hybrid model," Techland told our sister site, <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>"Employees who live near our offices will be asked to work from the office three days a week. For those working remotely from abroad, we're asking them to come to the office regularly to foster stronger connections.</p>
<p>"We understand this is a big change and all employees can still request home office days on demand as needed. We've just started this process and it's our goal to make the transition as smooth as possible and to support everyone individually."</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-to-become-majority-shareholder-in-dying-light-studio-techland">Dying Light developer Techland announced a partnership with Tencent</a>, which has become a majority shareholder.</p>
<p>Techland's CEO Paweł Marchewka said this partnership would allow the team to "move full speed ahead with the execution of the vision for [its] games", calling Tencent an "ally who has already partnered with some of the world's finest video game companies and helped them reach new heights while respecting their ways of doing things".</p>
<p>Techland retains full ownership of its IPs and maintains its "creative freedom".</p>

			<p>Star Wars Outlaws, which has been described as the first true Star Wars open world game ever made, is just a month and a half away from its August 30 release date. The countdown to launch has started for fans, and the developers at Ubisoft Massive have been featured in a few new interviews ahead of the event.</p>
<p>Game Director Julian Gerighty spoke at length <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/star-wars-outlaws-began-life-in-a-cafe-at-e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with GamesIndustry</a>, addressing common concerns such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-crew-2-ubisofitiest-game/">fatigue for traditional Ubisoft open world games</a> like Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. According to Gerighty, Massive's DNA has always been different to begin with.</p>
<p><em>We are hyper conscious of the Ubisoft house style. Massive has always been different. The Division and The Division 2 were different. Originally, Massive was an independent studio, then an Activision studio, so it has always thought very differently. The DNA of Massive is quite unique from Ubisoft. But there are so many great lessons to be learned by the Ubisoft way of making games.</em></p>
<p><em>And Star Wars itself suggested some different ways of doing things. I will give you one example. Instead of having a skill tree and an upgrade tree like a traditional game, here you seek out experts to create this padawan/master relationship in the world, which will lead you on adventures in order to upgrade your character. Everything is ingrained in people and the world.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, there won't be any towers to climb in order to reveal the 'fog of war' on the various planets. Protagonist Kay Vess will instead need to eavesdrop or collect information straight from specific non-player characters (NPCs) to discover certain missions and activities.</p>
<p>The planets (and space, too) will also be lively at all times, with dynamic events such as the Empire arresting some civilians, criminal syndicates skirmishing with one another, and other such scenarios. It will be up to the player whether to engage or not. Recently, Ubisoft Massive also <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-calibrated-its-size-to-ensure-it-would-be-always-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Star Wars Outlaws was carefully designed to ensure it would always feel fun, choosing quality over quantity. Even so, side content should be as long as the main quest, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the developers</a>. Completionists should be looking at around sixty hours worth of content in total.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is out on August 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. GeForce NOW users will be able to enjoy the PC version via cloud, including NVIDIA DLSS 3.5 and ray tracing if they are subscribed to the Ultimate tier; the game will also be playable right away for Ubisoft+ subscribers.</p>

You’ll (most likely) first see Apsaras, surrounded by demons kneeling before her. According to her, she wants to protect these demons by forcing them to acknowledge their weaknesses and seek protection from her circle of gods. Meanwhile, Leanan Sidhe wishes to enrich the lives of weaker demons and help them realize their dreams, even if it winds up cutting their lives short. - Timothy Monbleau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vengeance-asparas-or-leanan-1851583362&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-vengeance-asparas-or-leanan-1851583362">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc64655985e0e6f635d333f84c314a14" data-recommend-id="image://fc64655985e0e6f635d333f84c314a14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan, an unnamed character, and Mushu stand before a portal door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mulan, an unnamed character, and Mushu stand before a portal door." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc64655985e0e6f635d333f84c314a14" data-recommend-id="image://fc64655985e0e6f635d333f84c314a14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mulan, an unnamed character, and Mushu stand before a portal door." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley </em>is overflowing with beloved Disney characters, and while some are from more recent film outings, many have been adored by fans for decades prior to their arrival to the valley. Two of the newest additions to the game fall in the latter category, hailing from 1998's hit animated film <em>Mulan</em>. Indeed, the titular character and her hilarious sidekick, Mushu, are ready to join your valley whenever you’re ready to open their realm and invite them.  - Billy Givens <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disney-dreamlight-valley-mulan-mushu-unlock-1851581113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disney-dreamlight-valley-mulan-mushu-unlock-1851581113">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
