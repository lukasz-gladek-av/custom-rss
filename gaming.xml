Boardlandia, a popular online operation dedicated to quality, cannot move past the 145% (at the time of writing) trade tariffs on Chinese imports. As a result they have announced their closure.</p>

<h2>The Boardlandia Online Closure</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/04/23/online-board-game-seller-boardlandia-shuts-down-after-tariffs-add-unsustainable-burden-to-companys-existing-challenges/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, the Boardlandia closure is a direct result of the US trade tariffs adding, "an unsustainable burden" to existing financial challenges by the business.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/seafreight-cargo-ship.jpg?itok=veih2VUk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/seafreight-cargo-ship.jpg?itok=SEg_KGTy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the report, Boardlandia's owners, Tim and Karissa Fendt, said that despite pouring their personal savings, time, and countless hard hours of work into the company, there was no financially viable way to overcome the obstacle of Chinese tariffs. The Fendts did confirm that the brick-and-mortar store of Boardlandia in Appleton, Wisconsin, is not part of this closure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Please know that this outcome is not what we ever envisioned. We are not walking away from a thriving venture.</p>

<p>This closure is a direct result of circumstances that have become beyond our control, and it carries significant personal financial consequences for us as well.</p>

<p>We understand that you, our valued customers, may have questions and even concerns during this time.</p>

<p>We want to assure you that this was not a decision taken lightly or with any intention other than to responsibly address the financial realities we now face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Fendts confirmed that they are committed to shipping out any unfulfilled orders for which they have stock. They did not say how they will approach refunds for pre-orders or items that are out-of-stock.</p>

<p>The Boardlandia online store closure is yet another extension of the volatile actions by the Trump Administration in the past two months. Due to the vast majority of board game accessories and products are produced overseas in China, a 145% increase in important cost has severely impacted multiple tableop developers and publishers like Sentinels of the Multiverse developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>.</p>

<p>It is an act so devastating Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filing a lawsuit</a> against the administration over its use of trade tariffs.</p>

After all, plenty of people play the Switch in docked mode or in handheld mode within range of their home Wi-Fi. </p><p>Regardless of whether Fergusson’s explanation holds any water, it certainly sounds like Blizzard doesn’t currently have any plans to bring <em>Diablo IV</em> to the Switch 2, at least in the console’s first year. That flies in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaafRJpzNqY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaafRJpzNqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face of previous rumors</a></span> that the company had a port in development. Analysts had expected a lot of Microsoft first-party support for the Switch 2 at launch, but so far the company hasn’t announced anything despite its recent multiplatform pivot. </p><p>It’s a shame in the case of <em>Diablo IV</em> specifically, given how perfectly suited the action-RPG is to PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and the Rog Ally. Maybe Fergusson is just playing coy not to get ahead of Microsoft’s official plans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-shows-remakes-could-be-key-to-bethesda-getting-back-on-track<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">By Azura, by Azura, by Azura – the rumors were true. Yesterday, Bethesda set the internet on fire by finally pulling back the curtain on Virtuos’ remaster (or is it really a remake?) of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. An ‘Elder Scrolls Direct’ of sorts culminated in the surprise shadow-drop, which near-immediately transformed into hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. This moment of global hype and celebration feels like a much-needed port in the current storm Bethesda Game Studios has been facing in recent years. From conducting years-long damage control to rectify Fallout 76’s misfire launch, to the lackluster reception of its new sci-fi universe, Starfield, the studio’s most recent output has had many fans asking the same question: Has Bethesda lost the magic? There’s fiercer competition in the RPG space these days, with Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 and Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds franchise both garnering critical acclaim as Elder Scrolls and Fallout spiritual successors. But while Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 may be years away from reclaiming their crowns, this re-release of Oblivion may be a step in the right direction – just not in the direction you’d expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its peak, Bethesda Game Studios was an RPG juggernaut. In 2020, Microsoft’s <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-4-has-shipped-25-million-units-as-of-2020-as-per-leaked-microsoft-documents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked FTC documents</a> revealed that Fallout 4 had sold 25 million units-to-date. The game shifted over 5 million units in its first week alone according to <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/262199/fallout-4-sells-an-estimated-519m-first-week-at-retail/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGChartz</a>. Likewise, in 2023 Todd Howard announced Skyrim had crossed <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/186698/news/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-has-sold-over-60-million-copies-globally" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60 million sales</a> (though it’s worth noting rereleasing it 50 times likely helped). So what about Starfield? Estimates put it at just over <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/guides/starfield-how-many-copies-sold/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three million units</a> a year-and-a-half post launch. While taking into account Game Pass subscribers (which would boost players if not sales) and Starfield’s lack of a PlayStation presence, this must still be something of a disappointment for Bethesda. And while there <em>is</em> a Starfield fanbase, it’s far smaller than that enjoyed by The Elder Scrolls or Fallout, and even it has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">voiced displeasure</a> with the game’s first expansion, Shattered Space. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all leaves the developer with a big problem. With The Elder Scrolls 6 <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-of-pre-production-but-pete-hines-says-it-will-be-years-before-we-start-hearing-about-it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“years away”</a> and Fallout 5 just a whisper in the hallowed halls of the studio’s corridors, how can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumours of the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster began back in September 2023, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">leaked Microsoft documents</a> revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda titles, including a remaster of 2006’s landmark trip to Tamriel (it also includes another interesting remaster –  we’ll get to that soon). All was quiet until January 2025, when a former employee of Virtuos <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-reportedly-leak-online">let slip more details</a>, dividing Elder Scrolls fans as to their authenticity like the Stormcloaks vs. the Imperials. Finally, last week the dam broke (albeit early), setting the internet ablaze – there were over 6.4 million Google searches for ‘The Elder Scrolls VI: Oblivion’, rising by 713% in the last week alone. At its peak, Bethesda’s reveal livestream had over half a million viewers watching. Despite the leaks (or perhaps because of them), <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 600,000 people</a> tuned in to see a 19-year-old game re-revealed to them. The intense fervent demand to play the remaster caused discount game key websites like <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-oblivion-remaster-is-already-discounted-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-deal-websites" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDKeys to crash</a>, and slowed Fanatical and Green Man Gaming to a crawl. As of yesterday, Steam’s concurrent players stood at 125,000 and the game is firmly the #1 best seller. The enthusiasm Bethesda fans have for Oblivion burns as bright as the flames that spill from the Oblivion gates themselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. What better way to keep fans engaged and invested during these long development periods than to invite them to take a trip back to the mysterious isles of Morrowind or the hollowed-out husk of the East Coast? From a commercial standpoint, it makes clear sense. While Bethesda’s main development staff toils away on long-gestating new projects, trusted partners like Virtuos can use historic blueprints to craft remasters in shorter time frames. Such remasters are based on games with built-in audiences, and for many they’re the first real RPGs gamers will have sunk their teeth into during their respective generations. Restoring these works also invites a whole new generation to become obsessed with the inner workings of the land of Tamriel or crawl out from the post-apocalyptic fallout into Las Vegas and D.C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has already strategically uplifted its own catalogue once before. Fallout 4 was discounted by up to 75% during the Fallout TV show’s first season on Prime Video, alongside a cleverly scheduled next-gen update which brought over certain homages from the show. As a result, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-sales-top-ten-europe">Fallout 4 sales jumped over 7,500% in Europe</a> alone despite being nearly a decade old.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/oblivion-1745334385008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Oblivion Remastered offers a visit to the past that looks like the future. Image credit: Bethesda / Virtuos</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking back to Microsoft’s leaked Bethesda roadmap, many noted that a Fallout 3 remaster was listed to follow Oblivion two years later. It’s important to note the timelines from this original presentation have shifted – Oblivion was originally cited as fiscal year 2022. However, assuming these original gaps remain true, it appears a Fallout 3 remake could be on the cards for 2026 – just in time for Fallout Season 2, coincidentally. While a Fallout remaster seems inevitable now, given the second series’ shift to New Vegas, could it be possible that Bethesda’s early conversations with showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet mean that a surprise New Vegas remake could be in store? Given the synchronicity of the show’s first season to Fallout 4’s vibe and aesthetic, could Bethesda level-up its craftiness even more for the upcoming New Vegas-centric second season? It shadow-dropped Oblivion – it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a New Vegas Remastered trailer is lying in wait for us at the end of Fallout Season 2’s finale.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if there’s one game in Bethesda’s back catalogue that deserves to be remade the most, it’s undeniably The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Many Elder Scrolls fans have spent years fus-ro-dahing on the mountaintop for this, with one group of superfans going as far as to <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-morrowind-remake-074606-20240502" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake Morrowind using Skyrim’s tools</a>, ala Skyblivion. However, Morrowind is not as easy a game to remake as Oblivion. It sits on the precipice between Bethesda’s evolutions as a studio – it is literally built differently to our modern understanding of an Elder Scrolls game. It’s only partially voiced, most of the story is told through text, there are no quest markers (players must literally write down directions given by NPCs, save for those with perfect memories), and combat physics are non-existent. Whereas Virtuos was able to overhaul some of the more finicky systems of Oblivion, the entirety of Morrowind <em>is</em> a finicky system. It’s why many love the game, but it’s also why it’s difficult to remake. To remake Morrowind is a dangerous tightrope. Modernize it too much and you risk losing the magic it was originally imbued with. Leave too many antiquated systems in place, and it’ll feel worse than an almighty skooma hangover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a studio becomes the icon of a gaming sub-genre, the challenge is this: how do you innovate and evolve whilst holding onto your audience? Rockstar Games has kept Grand Theft Auto players satisfied for over a decade through the ever-expanding multiplayer world of GTA Online, which in turn fuels the eye-wateringly expensive rumored budget for GTA 6. Bethesda’s bread-and-butter is richly detailed, expansive worlds that are resolutely single-player – Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 just don’t hit in the same way. However, what’s clear through the overwhelming response to Virtuos’ Oblivion remaster is that gamers are more than on-board to dive back into the historic annals of Elder Scrolls of years-gone-by. That’s not to say any remaster is a slam dunk – this particular one is a clear product of careful consideration and skilled development, and a lesser game may have garnered a very different response, ala Rockstar’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review">GTA Definitive Editions</a> – but what better way for the former king of the modern RPG to get back on track than to breathe new life into some old classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s GameCube controller has been the subject of some confusion since its announcement, regarding whether it would be usable with non-GameCube games on Switch 2 or not.
</p>
<p>
Officially, it has been designed for use with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics collection that will be available to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers</a> when the console launches.
</p>
<p>
But could you use a Switch 2 GameCube controller to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, for example? Well, Nintendo has now provided some additional detail here - and the answer to that question is... maybe?
</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
"The Nintendo GameCube controller is designed for use with the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics collection of games and is an optional way to play those games," a Nintendo spokesperson stated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-gamecube-controller-compatible-with-other-games-but-there-may-be-some-issues">Nintendo Life</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Since it doesn't have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games," Nintendo continued. "The Nintendo GameCube controller can only be used on Nintendo Switch 2 and is not compatible with Nintendo Switch."
</p>
<p>
So, by the nature of confirming the Switch 2 GameCube controller may have issues with non-GameCube <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, Nintendo is suggesting you can use it for other titles - at your peril. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, with a bit of button remapping, Mario Kart World play will be possible.
</p>
<p>
And helpfully, just as Nintendo answers this question, it has <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-gamecube-gcn-controller-nintendo-classics-000000000010015326">placed the Nintendo GameCube controller up for sale in the UK on the official My Nintendo Store</a>. Fancy one? It costs £59.
</p>
<p>
At launch, Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics will include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> (the original version, so no speedy sailing!), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> and SoulCalibur 2. 
</p>
<p>
Down the line, other upcoming games will include Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Luigi's Mansion and Chibi-Robo!
</p>
<p>
Skies of Arcadia: Legends, when?
</p>
<p>"Some of these have become quite rare to find in physical form, so it's great to see them become more widely accessible," Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote in his recent look <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-gamecube-emulation-is-finally-coming-to-switch-2">behind the scenes at how Nintendo is emulating the games</a>, "even if we still wonder if perhaps all of this could have been achievable years ago on the original Switch".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-blue-prince-never-end.1171464/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After 162 hours I have finally “beaten” <em>Blue Prince</em>, or at least I think I have. I know that I have wrapped up the puzzles and discovered and solved the mysteries that are currently known to the public. After a brutal gauntlet that took an entire day, I reached a moment of catharsis that totally inverted my perception of the lore of the game’s world. And yet I’m left restless; many people are, and that’s by design. That’s because <em>Blue Prince</em> is a game that can make you have a mental breakdown.</p><p><strong>Some light spoilers ahead.</strong></p><p>Madness is baked into the structure of the game. Though <em>Blue Prince </em>has an immediate goal, namely getting to room 46, that is basically just the first chapter of the game. When you get to that final room, you realize that there are countless layers of puzzles still left unaccounted for, several mysteries still not solved.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s perfectly acceptable to play the game like a <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-sicko</a>, like my co-worker Riley, and will probably make you happier long term. But what elevates <em>Blue Prince </em>from a simply good game to a brilliant one is that it indulges your prodding. Countless times I have said “hey, what if I do this?” only to be vindicated with a reward or comical punishment. Every possibility has seemingly been thought of by the game developer, including a specialized end of day message if you clip through the geometry of the world (“Fall it a day,” the message reads). I have never seen a game more adept at slowly increasing the complexity of its puzzle design. Like a metaphorical frog being boiled, you don’t realize how far you’re in until it’s too late.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="松本人志監督最新作 【しんぼる】　絶賛上映中！" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fex2qynrSI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The ramp in difficulty has a tinge of punishment that I appreciate. While playing I was reminded of the 2009 Japanese absurdist comedy <em>Symbol, </em>in which a man wakes up in a blank room wearing clown pajamas. The walls are covered in angel penises, white like light switches, and every time he honks one “something” happens, often to his frustration and torment. His goal quickly becomes to escape the room, but every time he gains a foothold another barrier erupts to smack him down, breaking him mentally. <em>Symbol’s </em>director/actor Hitoshi Matsumoto is best known for being on the hit variety show <em>Gaki No Tsukai</em>, known for its infamous “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batsu_game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batsu games</a>” like “No-Reaction Pie Hell” and “ 24-Hour Tag,” and that goofy, Looney Tunes sadism is infused in many of his films and shows. These are works about people inhabiting a space with arbitrary rules, and that space drives them to the brink of madness.</p><figure><figcaption>Finding the key in Symbol (2009). Credit: Shochiku</figcaption></figure><p>That playful flavor of the Japanese Batsu game exists to a certain degree in <em>Blue Prince</em>. At times, the game will set up an elaborate and sometimes tedious task that can only be gleaned contextually through certain somewhat opaque clues such as oblique ciphers and homonyms. After several hours a task will be completed, only for a new barrier between you and your goal to appear. One of them, which I will not spoil, was so comical that I ugly laughed to myself at two in the morning. Another challenge came on so suddenly and was so terrifying I started swearing. But this friction was so exhilarating that surviving it simply made me want more. Digging deeper into <em>Blue Prince </em>also rewards you with more and more tantalizing information about the world, more sordid yet cryptic details about your character’s family history as well as the history of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The deeper you go, however, the more obtuse the messages become. Talking to a friend becomes vital, and there are some solutions that I would not expect a regular person to crack without some degree of hinting, although figuring them out organically without help feels exhilarating. And lest I paint <em>Blue Prince</em> as simply an exercise in sadism, the game is also quite good at giving you multiple methods of coming to a conclusion, even at the very end. There is a constant conversation happening between the developer and the player, but it’s also quite clear that Tonda Ros enjoys watching people sweat a little.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Raw Fury</figcaption></figure><p>There are many potential offramps in <em>Blue Prince</em>, many stop signs where you can put the game down and say “I’m good.” You do not need to go beyond room 46. You can be satisfied with several other potential endings. But is that enough for you? Do you think that you’d be happy knowing there’s so much more of the world you haven’t seen? Do you think you “really” beat the game at that point, or would you prefer to see how deep the Sicko path goes? Over the course of more than 100 hours, the game slowly unveils layers of itself.</p><p>In pursuing the depths of what <em>Blue Prince </em>has to offer, the player becomes changed – trained to see everything, no matter how minute, as a clue. To get to “the end” is to become slightly unwell, like John Nash in the deeply mediocre yet iconic biopic <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>. And what makes the current “end” of the game so frustrating, despite being a perfectly fine conclusion, is that many clues, leads, and loose ends remain currently unresolved – including a central mystery of the game. I will admit that it is absurd to ask for more from a game I have dumped 162 hours into, but if that’s the end, it is a melancholic one. Leaving that many loose strings is either uncharacteristically lax from an otherwise meticulously planned game, a series of red herrings to drive the player base insane, or a sign that the game has not been beaten.</p><p>It is theoretically possible that there is, somehow, an entirely new sub-basement buried under all these clues that nobody has figured out yet. It is also possible that the key to whatever is next lies in a future update (the arcade game <em>Dirigiblocks</em> is slated to be added in a future update), although that feels out of character as well.<em> </em>But the game has been out for two weeks and people are usually adept at figuring these things out quite quickly. The community playing this game is also ravenous, and the most devoted among them are spiraling into madness as I write this. Perhaps the clues that remain are themselves less an indication of “more game” and more a puzzle about the world itself. If there is a new layer under all this, I will be absolutely floored.</p><p>It’s also possible that this is the end of the rabbit hole. Maybe no ending could ever satisfy the kind of players that the game has created and that it has trapped itself into a corner of anticlimax. Maybe there is a metatext here about puzzles and clues, about some mysteries tormenting you and clawing at you for your entire life, just out of reach.</p><figure><figcaption>If he only had a clue, he'd know what to do. Credit: Raw Fury.</figcaption></figure><p>There is a book in <em>Blue Prince</em> that can be bought at the Bookstore called <em>A New Clue</em>. It’s a children’s book about a detective who searches for clues, written by your character’s mother. It is a useful document in helping you crack the mystery of what comes next after you beat the first objective in the game. It is also a children’s book about a man being driven to madness trying to find solutions to mysteries, about his insatiable need for more clues. It is explicitly a book about the fictional writer’s son, but also you as a reader and player. “A man obsessed and a cuckoo too” the book says, portraying a disheveled, restless detective protagonist.&nbsp;</p><p>There is one other in-game document that continues to gnaw at me. It’s a note, deeply important in the lore of the game though its significance has not yielded any in-game progress, at least mechanically.&nbsp; Perhaps, like <em>A New Clue</em>, it is the key to depths and mysteries that have not been discovered yet. Or maybe it is telling the player exactly what this game really is about.&nbsp;</p><p>It is simply a spiral, one that you will see many times throughout the game in many forms. On the note, scrawled in a sleepless woman’s cursive, it simply reads “does it never end?” I honestly can’t say.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Raw Fury</figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom"><h3>Fine, I’ll Play Star Wars XCOM</h3></a><p>It's got permadeath, and that's enough for me</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Ghost of Yōtei will launch for PS5 on 2nd October 2025, Sucker Punch delivering the long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> five years on from their PS4 samurai epic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - The Onryō’s List | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. Set in the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603, there’s a real Western vibe to some of the scenery and imagery that has been used for the game’s trailers.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a new Ghost to play as, named Atsu. Hers, as is so often the case for this kind of fiction, is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down&nbsp;The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>
<p>Sucker Punch explain, though, that this isn’t purely about revenge, and that through this tale she will make new allies, forge connections to the people and the land, and look to gain a new sense of purpose for once she’s finished killing the bad guys. It sounds thoroughly wholesome.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the game will start on 2nd May, with a standard price of £69.99 / $69.99 / €79.99, which rubs salt in the wounds of all the Mario Kart fans out there. There are, however, a bunch of deluxe and collector’s editions that I’ll just point you to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/">PS Blog</a> to read about.</p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was a major hit for PlayStation, adding to the growing stable of prestige AAA titles at the tail end of the last generation. Leading up to the game’s release there were concerns that its homage to samurai cinema would be too niche or that it would ape other open world games too closely. However, spurred on by the lockdown-induced gaming fever many of us fell victim to in the summer of 2020, Ghost of Tsushima would crush expectations to become on the PS4’s must-have exclusives. Having since launched on PS5 alongside the Iki Island DLC, and after debuting its superb multiplayer expansion, it’s become an all-time great for the console.</p>
<p>Looking back on out original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima review</a>, Aran said, “Ghost of Tsushima is an artistic triumph, capturing a real cinematic feel through its visuals, immersive world and soundtrack. However, Jin is a serviceable main character and he and his journey to save Tsushima is often overshadowed by secondary characters and smaller, more personal stories found in the side quests. Throw in some formulaic missions and an awkward user interface, and Ghost of Tsushima is at times more style than substance.”</p>

			<p>The original Nintendo Switch is hardly going to be remembered for its hardware specifications, but with some overclocking and 8 GB of RAM, the system is capable of accomplishing some impressive feats, such as running PlayStation 3 games surprisingly well.</p>
<p>A new video shared this week by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030">Naga</a> on YouTube shows how an overclocked Nintendo Switch modded with 8 GB of RAM runs several PlayStation 3 games via the RPCS3 emulator. The results are quite impressive, as the system can run a game like Rayman Origins at 1440p resolution almost flawlessly. Other games are not perfectly emulated, but still run surprisingly well, like the Sly Raccoon and Kingdom Hearts HD remasters. More demanding games like Demon's Souls and Prince of Persia Sands of Time HD, however, don't manage to achieve playable status, but even just seeing them run at 20 FPS or below is impressive enough, considering how demanding PlayStation 3 emulation can be.</p>
<p><iframe title="RPCS3 on Nintendo Switch - 16 Games Tested" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7SK6RiKud0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing what is <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">achievable</a> on an overclocked Nintendo Switch with additional RAM, one can only wonder how far the Nintendo Switch 2's more powerful hardware can be pushed. So far, things are definitely looking bright for the new console, as it's not only way more powerful than its predecessor, but also supports advanced features like ray tracing and NVIDIA DLSS. The impressive Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 port has been recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/">confirmed</a> to be the first game using NVIDIA DLSS, so it will be very interesting to see how other developers will be able to take advantage of the upscaler to deliver even better visuals and more stable performance.</p>

And worse yet, monsters inhabiting the “Glitches” are said to replace users in the real world leaving everyone none the wiser.</p><p>The protagonist soon discovers that this urban legend is very real and some students have already been replaced by monsters, forcing them to take a stand. As a member of the Student Support Services (SSS), a guild dedicated to solving the academy’s troubles, players must guide their friends, strengthen bonds, and fight to protect the school from impending doom. However, navigating these relationships comes with its own challenges—getting too close to multiple people may lead to unexpected consequences.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the core of <em>VARLET</em>‘s experience is its dynamic Triad Stats system, which shapes character progression based on player choices. These six distinct attributes are divided between Light and Dark Triad traits, influencing dialogue options and passive battle skills. Light Triad stats emphasize morality, sympathy, and altruism, while Dark Triad stats lean into Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and narcissism. Players will determine their true nature, either as a guiding leader who uplifts and empowers allies in battle or as a ruthless ruler wielding immense power even at a personal cost.</p></blockquote><p>The game’s staff includes:</p><ul><li><strong>Character Theme Song Composers</strong><ul><li>Daibakuhashin</li><li>Hitoshizuki and Yamasankakkei</li><li><a title="Games > Kanon [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kanon">KANON</a>69</li><li>NILFRUITS</li><li>OSTER project</li><li>Tadano Kede / A4.</li><li>wotaku</li><li>Yoshida Yasei</li></ul></li><li><strong>Background Music:</strong> Tsukasa <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>uko</li><li><strong>Scenario:</strong> Gakuto Mikumo, Ryutaro Ito</li><li><strong>Scenario Editing:</strong> Kazunari Suzuki</li><li><strong>Series Original Work:</strong> Fuyuki Hayashi</li><li><strong>Production:</strong> FuRyu</li><li><strong>Development:</strong> AQURIA</li><li><strong>Produce and Direction:</strong> Hideaki Ito</li><li><strong>Direction:</strong> Takashi Muto</li></ul><p>An “Announcement Presentation” live stream will premiere on <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20250425T1200" target="_blank">April 25 at 5:00 a.m. PT / 8:00 a.m. ET / 21:00 JST</a>, featuring the premiere of the opening movie and the latest information on the game with the voice cast.

                <p>Nintendo has dropped some bad news for Japanese consumers looking to get the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> console directly from the company, as it has confirmed that a "significant" number of customers there will not be selected as winners of the My Nintendo Store lottery sale. In a statement, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa apologized for the situation and said that applications had exceeded the company's expectations.</p><p>"To deliver Nintendo Switch 2 to all of you, we have been procuring a large number of components in advance and proceeding with production," Furukawa said on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo's Japanese X account</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-says-a-significant-number-of-japanese-players-will-miss-out-on-its-switch-2-pre-order-lottery/" rel="nofollow ">via a VGC translation</a>). "On April 2, we announced the details of Nintendo Switch 2 and began accepting applications for a lottery sale on the My Nintendo Store. As a result, we received applications from an astonishing 2.2 million people in Japan alone. However, this far exceeded our prior expectations and greatly surpasses the number of Nintendo Switch 2 units we can deliver from the My Nintendo Store on June 5. Consequently, it is with great regret that we anticipate a significant number of customers will not be selected in tomorrow's lottery announcement on April 24."</p><div tabindex="0"

The selected people will receive an invitation email valid for three days, which will allow them to preorder the Switch 2, provided they have purchased any Nintendo Switch Online membership, have been subscribed for a minimum of 12 months, and have 50 hours or more of total gameplay hours on their account.</p><p>After a period of uncertainty, Nintendo revealed that Switch 2 prices in the US will remain unchanged--$450 for the base model Switch 2 and $500 for the version that includes Mario Kart World--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/">but prices for first-party accessories are increasing.</a> Ahead of its release on June 5, Nintendo has also begun sharing more details on the Switch 2, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-pro-controllers-charging-time-is-half-that-of-the-original-device-nintendo-says/1100-6531004/">how the new Pro Controller can be fully charged much more quickly</a> than the original model.</p>

			<p>If you have been following us for some time, you are well aware of how much I like FromSoftware's Souls series. Despite having quite a few problems getting into the original Demon's Souls before it officially made its way to the West back in the PS3 days, once the game clicked, I came to appreciate the formula so much that I even enjoyed Dark Souls 2 with all of its well-known issues.</p>
<p>Having something of a fondness for clunky experiences that still manage to get some of their features right, I expected to enjoy <a href="https://lordsofthefallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a> by Hexworks far more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">I actually did</a>. While the game wasn't bad by any means, there were too many issues in the launch version to make it anything more than a decent experience, though far too frustrating for my taste. I felt the developer completely misunderstood the idea of challenge that FromSoftware implements in its titles, going for unbalanced enemy configurations that, coupled with the frankly bad movesets of most weapons, made going through any area past the tutorial a pointless exercise in patience. For this reason, after clearing Lords of the Fallen, I never returned to it, as I felt that the bad definitely outweighed the good the game had.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lords-of-the-Fallen-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following the launch of the game, however, Hexworks showed some exemplary dedication to their game and has often updated Lords of the Fallen with new features and balance changes, culminating with the release of the 2.0 update <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-out-now-with-enhanced-combatmovement-and-free-friends-pass/">last week</a>, which massively improves the game in pretty much every way. For starters, the game is much more forgiving and better eases the player into the experience after completing the tutorial, which I felt, in the launch version, wasn't really representative of what awaited players in the real game. Some may find the game too easy now, but the presence of some modifiers allows players to ramp up the challenge level, providing an unprecedented level of flexibility for a Soulslike. I haven't played through the entire game yet, but the fact that I was not swarmed by three enemies or more while getting sniped by long-range fighters as soon as the proper journey begins has made me more willing to play through it again to experience its solid world design once again. The addition of Lamp Guidance, a new mechanic that guides players from one Vestige save point to another, is a very welcome touch that makes experiencing the game's world even more enjoyable and stress-free.</p>
<p>The 2.0 update also brought significant improvements to movement and combat, which ultimately make Lords of the Fallen a much better game. For starters, the Crusader is much more responsive, which, by itself, already makes combat more enjoyable against single enemies and even groups. Movesets have also been massively improved, with similar weapons also getting some differentiation between them that gives them a more distinct identity and provides more reasons for players to use them besides stats. The movesets overhaul also makes any combat maneuver considerably less floaty, so the massive positioning issues I experienced at launch are no longer present, though combat still feels a little unsatisfying, as movesets still lack weight, animations are stiff, and sound effects continue to sound a little too thin for my tastes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lords-of-the-Fallen-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new Lords of the Fallen update also goes a long way in improving the co-op experience with some very welcome tweaks. Shared co-op progression is a game changer, allowing players to seamlessly enjoy the entire game together, something that FromSoftware titles do not offer, and is only available on PC via mods. The Free Friend's Pass is also an incredibly generous offering that allows players to experience the game without owning it, which is, again, something that is rarely offered. In this regard, Hexworks really hit it out of the park, not only listening to players' feedback but going the extra mile to make the experience as enjoyable and accessible as possible in terms of multiplayer.</p>
<p>While the 2.0 update doesn't address all the issues found in Lords of the Fallen, as the clunky inventory management hasn't been improved, and some of its additions aren't exactly great, like the new UI which I feel doesn't really fit the game's aesthetics too much, there's no denying that Hexworks' dedication to their game has paid off big time. It's rare that we see such a level of post-launch support for a single-player-focused experience, and as such, the developer has to be commended for it. Hopefully, the lessons learned during the long development of Lords of the Fallen will benefit its sequel, which is currently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/">development</a> for PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analysis firm Circana has released its gaming sales data for March, and it probably won't come as a surprise that Ubisoft's latest major release&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is leading the pack for the month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>topped the all-format sales chart for March, with new sports release&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25&nbsp;</em>coming in second. Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is in third, which isn't surprising given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">incredibly strong sales performance</a>.</p>

<p><em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is also Xbox's top-selling game for the month, although it's pipped to the post on PlayStation by the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>. Since neither game launched on Switch, the honor for Nintendo's console goes instead to&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=CajVuSfV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=qOFJBYOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling Switch game in March.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of play time,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the charts for both PlayStation and Xbox, although the honor on Steam goes to wacky co-op horror game&nbsp;<em>R.E.P.O.</em>, probably because&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' March performance wasn't enough to give it the top spot in the year-to-date sales chart; that still belongs to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a very respectable second place.</p>

<p>Hardware spending fell by 25% over last March, representing the lowest March total since 2019. Sony's PS5 was once again the market leader for both dollar and unit sales, with Xbox Series X|S coming in second on both measures.</p>

<p>Switch sales dropped by 37% when compared to last March, although that's almost certainly due in large part to consumers waiting for the Switch 2, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in June this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=quiYN9ZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=h_sClzgN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch sales are down, but the Switch 2 is coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, gaming spending dropped by 6% in March when compared to March last year, with only non-mobile subscriptions and console premium digital purchases growing.</p>

Oblivion, which first launched in 2006, was one of the chief culprits, with objects flying all over the place, characters making poorly-timed (but often hilarious) on-screen interjections, and <em>things </em>happening in the background that, in the context of what was going on in the foreground, were perfect meme material.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 20 years later, and Bethesda’s remaster (not a remake, it’s insisted), has all the “charm,” of the original, as Todd Howard put it. And that’s not an issue. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion is back,” is what players of the remaster are saying in response to clips of the game going wrong in some way, or doing that Bethesda game thing of having a random NPC's face steal the scene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even glitches players exploited in the original Oblivion have been found to work in the remaster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The permanent bound weapons and armour glitch still works in Oblivion Remastered LMAO <a href="https://t.co/Nzp8gCAucK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Nzp8gCAucK</a></p>— Nerbit (@Nerbit_13098) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerbit_13098/status/1914780386648809874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">And players are recreating Oblivion memes, trying to recapture the hilarity of the game’s NPC behavior as it was all those years ago.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Original for comparison <a href="https://t.co/egYXGxe438" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/egYXGxe438</a></p>— crobb 🌹 (@corombb) <a href="https://twitter.com/corombb/status/1914864882232475829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">None of Oblivion Remastered’s jank is seriously affecting player enjoyment of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most pivotal moment in any Pokemon game comes right at the start – choosing your partner Pokemon. The first moment you lock eyes with the creature you’ll spend tens of hours raising, bonding with and sending into battle is a special experience. That decision is usually based on vibes and taste to the point where many fans see it as a personality test. However, in those moments, you have no knowledge of how that decision will affect your journey to becoming a Pokemon master, with the gyms, rivals and secrets of the region yet to reveal themselves to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we’ve done the research, looked into the base stats, found every strength and weakness of every starter Pokemon and all their evolutions and pitted them against their native regions to determine who is the best starter pick, not just to get you past the first couple gyms, but to take on the Elite Four and beyond. This is the first step to becoming a Pokemon master across all iterations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 1: Bulbasaur</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-bulbasaurpng-1745318747449.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While being the obvious pick to tackle the first gym in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-red-version">Pokemon Red</a> and Blue (Grass beats Rock, as any Pokemon fan knows), Bulbasaur outshines both Charmander and Squirtle as  the best starter pick in any bid to dominate the Kanto region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial analysis might understandably lean towards Charmander. Fire types are a minority in Gen 1, many random encounters pitt you against Flying types (which are strong against Bulbasaur’s Grass) and the final gym is heavy on Ground types – something Charizard is immune to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those who are Bulbasaur-inclined will find themselves flying through the majority of the game, with the Grass type being super effective against Brock’s Rock Pokemon, Misty’s Water collection, and the Giovanni’s final gym line-up, as well as being the best choice to take out the first two members of the Elite Four. The biggest challenge Bulbasaur will face are Erika’s Grass type gym, where strategy will be vital to overcoming the barrage of “not very effective” attacks, and Blaine’s Fire type gym, which can be defeated thanks to the abundance of water types present in Kanto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some issues a Bulbasaur trainer will have to contend with, not least the many Pidgeys and Spearows you’ll come across in tall grass, whose Flying typing will provide a problem for anyone looking to grind their way to a high level. Thankfully, the amount of Ground and Rock types in caves will provide ample opportunity for Bulbasaur to wipe out entire bloodlines of Pokemon to gain a few XP. Also problematic are the frequent encounters with Blue, whose Pidgeot and Charmander will be a consistent issue, the latter of which can be helped by a Water type on your team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Bulbasaur, along with having well-balanced base stats, has the added bonus of evolving into Venasaur who also is a poison-type, giving him a solid advantage over the other two offerings from Professor Oak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 2: Cyndaquil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-cyndaquil-1745320920819.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokemon Gold</a> and Silver introduced just eight new Fire types to the series, in comparison to 10 Grass and 18 Water types. That minority means snapping up a powerful Fire Pokemon like Cyndaquil from the start adds a great deal of diversity to your team. More importantly, Cyndaquil proves to be the best matchup for the majority of gyms and Elite Four members that populate Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugsy’s (you guessed it) Bug type gym and Jasmine’s Steel type gym will easily fall before a few Embers and Flame Wheels from Cyndaquil and his subsequent evolutions. The same cannot be said for the cutest of the starters, Water type Totodile, with there being no Fire, Ground or Rock gyms for him to dismantle. Grass type Chikorita (or more likely her third form, Meganium) would have a field day in Pryce’s Water gym but would struggle with the early Bug and Flying type gyms as well as Morty’s Poison type gym. Pryce will pose a problem for Cyndaquil, and so you’ll want to put together a well-balanced team to get you through that penultimate gym, but you’ll have many hours to assemble the perfect group before that hurdle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Cyndaquil’s favour are the Grass and Bug types dotted throughout the Elite Four’s roster. Though all four of these teams are well-balanced enough to give you trouble no matter who you pick as a starter, the many Poison types and Lance’s team of Dragon/Flying types makes this a no-go zone for Meganium. Meanwhile Totodile’s final evolution, Ferligator, would certainly hold its own against many of these Pokemon, but won’t blaze through a few like Typhlosion will. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking Cyndaquil does come with its issues. There will be many Rock and Ground Pokemon bothering you with random encounters in caves and Lance’s team containing a Charizard and a Gyrados will require some solid strategy to overcome, but the effects of these are much lesser compared to what ails Chikorita and Totodile. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 3: Mudkip</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-mudkip-1745320946409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might pick Mudkip because you just think he’s neat, but the reasons to go Water type for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version">Pokemon Ruby</a> and Sapphire run a bit deeper. In terms of gyms, Water type Mudkip has a bit of competition from the Grass type Treecko as both of them are super effective against three of the eight. They both have an advantage in Roxanne’s and Tate &amp; Liza’s Rock/Ground gyms, while Mudkip will be best suited to take on Flannery’s Fire gym and Treeko for Wallace’s Water gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you get to Wallace, Treeko would have almost definitely evolved into Sceptile, as Sootopolis City houses the final gym. The significance of that can’t be understated, but Treeko’s Grass typing sees it at a disadvantage in battles with Flannery and with Winona’s Flying type lineup. Mudkip, on the other hand, will struggle with just the one gym – Wattson’s (you guessed it) Electric type gym early on in Mauville City. Your third option, Torchic, doesn’t really enter the conversation here, with Fire types being super effective against none of the gyms and Fighting (a type gained by Torchic’s third form, Blazicken), only super effective against one, not to mention being at a massive disadvantage for Wallace’s battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The makeup of the Elite Four can lend a slight advantage towards Treeko’s final form, Sceptile, as you come across Glacia’s Ice/Water Pokemon and a few Grass Pokemon along the way which will cause Swampert (Mudkip’s third evolution) some issues. However, as Mudkip evolves into its final form, it gains Ground typing and very nicely balanced stats which see it gain a huge defensive boost, becoming immune to Electric and its only weakness being Grass. This makes Swampert able to power through battles where it usually might be the underdog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another consideration may be the amount of water present in the Hoenn region, meaning random encounters can be a bit of a grind, but Mudkip shows enough advantages in other areas to overcome that obstacle. Bonus points for being the cutest of the bunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 4: Chimchar</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-chimchar-1745320985367.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing the trend from the very first game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokemon Diamond</a> and Pearl adds far fewer Fire type Pokemon to the series; just five in comparison to the14 introduced for Water and Grass. Though this isn’t a deciding factor in which starter to pick, it adds to the list of attributes going in Fire type Chimchar’s favour over Grass type Turtwig and Water type Piplup. Three is the magic number in terms of how many gyms a Pokemon needs to be super effective against to come out on top over its peers, and Chimchar’s Fire typing helps it overcome Gardenia’s Grass type gym, as well as the sixth and seventh gyms ran by Byron’s Steel types and Candice’s Ice types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chimchar faces tough competition from Turtwig, who can eliminate Roark’s Rock type and Crasher Wake’s Water type gyms with ease. After evolving into Torterra, it also gains Ground typing, making it immune to Electric attacks which will see it waltz through the final gym owned by Volkner. Though they may seem perfectly matched, a lot of Turtwig’s strengths are most exemplified in the early stages of the game, while Chimchar’s abilities sees him primed for late game success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming through the gyms with minimal fuss is important due to the Sinnoh region’s very well-balanced Elite Four. Chimchar’s final evolution, Infernape, is perfect to take on Aaron’s Bug Pokemon, which would be super effective against Torterra, but the Grass type would admittedly be best to dismantle Bertha’s Water and Ground types. Piplup, despite evolving into the very resilient Empoleon, doesn’t have a significant advantage over many of the gym leaders or the Elite Four to make a dent here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a close matchup between Chimchar and Torterra, but due to the frequent battles with Team Galactic’s Bug types, the advantage falls with Chimchar, who has the gym battle credentials to back it up. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 5: Tepig</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-tepig-1745321009249.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gen 5 makes for a more clean cut decision, with the Fire type Tepig making the biggest claim for being the smartest pick. Grass type Snivy doesn’t quite make the cut as it only has an advantage over just the one gym, nor any significant advantages over any Elite Four member, as well as being plagued by the various Bug and Flying types across the Unova region’s tall grass and boss battles. Water type Oshawott isn’t as embattled as Snivy, being the best choice to take on Clay’s Ground type gym and being resistant to Brycen’s Ice Pokemon, which are super effective against Snivy. But like the Grass type, there are no Elite Four members who lean into a type specifically tailored to Oshawott or its evolutions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tepig’s Fire abilities, and its final form, Emboar, also being a Fighting type, allows it to have a smoother ride through Unova. Firstly, Burgh’s Bug gym and Brycen’s gym are light work for a Fire type, the latter being the penultimate gym in the game. Alternative solutions will need to be found to make it through Clay’s Ground-based gym, but the same can be said for Oshawott as it arrives in Elesa’s Electric gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elite Four battles are where Emboar’s Fighting type comes in handy, being super effective against Grimsley’s Dark type Pokemon. Emboar is admittedly vulnerable to Caitlin’s Psychic types, but if you have a strong enough bench, this battle can easily be overcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Emboar’s favour are his strong attacking stats and the presence of Team Plasma, who have an abundance of Steel types. Having to fight the Elite Four twice makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokemon Black</a> and White a tough challenge no matter who you choose, but Tepig can put your mind at ease more often than the others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 6: Fennekin</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fennekin-1745321043423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-x-version">Pokemon X</a> and Y continue the dominance of Fire types in this list. The sixth generation has a quirk where you can choose from two sets of starters, first between the new bunch of Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie, and later between the Kanto starters from the original games. For this list, we’ll focus on the starters unique to this game, of which Fennekin is the standout. The Fire Pokemon can almost stroll through the gyms, being super effective against three and resistant to two more. Though two of those gyms are in the early stages of the game, the final three being Fairy, Psychic and Ice based means that Fennekin’s third evolution, Delphox, now imbued with Psychic typing, can head off to the Pokemon League relatively unscathed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Froakie evolves into Greninja, a Water/Dark type Pokemon, making it super effective against Olympia’s Psychic team but weak against Valerie’s Fairy types. Being a Water type mostly gets it into trouble, matching up poorly against Ramos’ Grass types and Clemont’s Electric types, something Grant’s early Rock gym doesn’t make up for. Chespin’s story makes for similar reading, struggling off the bat with Viola’s Bug gym and going on to gain a Fighting typing after evolving into Chesnaught which leaves it at a disadvantage against Olmpia and Valerie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the games progress, the Elite Fours get a bit more balanced. Pokemon X and Y is another example of a series of battles suited to a different type each time. You’ll want Water to overcome Malva, Fire to overcome Wikstrom and Grass to overcome Siebold. Delphox just about has the edge, able to resist whatever Diantha’s Gardevoir throws at it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 7: Litten</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-litten-1745321072999.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out this Fire type four-peat is Litten from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sun-version">Pokemon Sun</a> and Moon. Despite having to struggle through the first couple trials (the Alola region’s version of gyms, of which there are only seven), Litten is the obvious choice for the rest of the battles. Mallow’s Grass trial is the only lineup where each Pokemon is weak to Fire, but Sophocles’ Electric gym contains two Steel types and a Bug type. And by the time you arrive at Acerola’s Ghost trial you could have evolved Litten into the Fire/Dark type Incineroar whose attacks will be super effective against the whole lineup, especially the Grass and Ice Pokemon in Acerola’s team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final trial, in which you must face Mina with her Fairy Pokemon, is a little more complicated because of Incineroar’s Dark typing. A regular Fire type would be able to resist Fairy attacks, but Incineroar is damaged normally by them. Helpfully, Mina has a Steel, Grass and Bug type in her team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Litten’s starter counterparts, Rowlet and Popplio, will find success with one of the first three trials, but will cease to have an advantage over any of the late game battles. Rowlet’s evolution, Decidueye, gains Ghost typing, which is a blessing and a curse for Acerola’s trial, but doesn’t garner much of an advantage elsewhere. Popplio evolves into the Water/Fairy type Primarina, but that doesn’t affect its fortunes with the trials at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sun and Moon’s Elite Four are just a small fraction of what awaits you in the Pokemon League. After becoming champion yourself, you face challenges from 10 more trainers looking to take your place. These battles, on top of the Elite Four themselves, are too diverse for any starter to have any advantage over the other, meaning Litten’s ability to clear the trials is even more vital. The Alola region also introduces just eight Fire Pokemon in comparison to Grass and Water’s 13 (after the series had become more balanced in that regard) so snapping Litten up early is a great aid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 8: Sobble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-sobble-1745321095167.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobble’s victory over Grookey and Scorbunny might be the closest of the lot. All three Pokemon are the best picks against three gyms, with Gordie and Raihan’s Rock and Ground gyms being perfect for Sobble and Grookey, and Melony’s Ice gym and Opal’s Fairy gym being tailor made for Scorbunny. Additionally, the first three gyms are Grass, Water and Fire typed, in that order, lending no advantage to any of the three starters. Raihan’s gym being the final one gives it a bit more importance, so the gym battles give a hair’s breadth of a lead to Grookey and Sobble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Galar region’s version of the Elite Four, The Champion Cup, allows Sobble to just inch past Grookey in the standings. None of these Pokemon’s final evolutions gain any new types, making them work with what they’re given from the start. The semi-final opponents don’t lean any particular way, but Bede's Fairy Pokemon, followed by Nessa’s Water types and Raihan’s Fire and Ground heavy Dragon team, favour Fire, Grass and Water respectively. If success against the toughest opponents is most valued, then Sobble just about edges victory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other considerations like the rivals, Team Yell, and random encounters are even less impactful than normal in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sword">Pokemon Sword</a> and Shield. Team Yell uses mostly Dark types, which attack and defend normally against Fire, Water and Grass types, and the introduction of overworld Pokemon means random encounters happen less. If there’s any other factor that tips the scales towards Sobble, it would be that its final evolution, Inteleon, has a nicely balanced set of stats. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 9: Fuecoco</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fuecoco-1745321116725.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth Fire type to be chosen on this list is one of the clearest winners. You might think that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet">Pokemon Scarlet</a> and Violet’s focus on player freedom might allow for little separation between Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly – You can do the gyms and raid Team Star bases in any order you like and you can avoid encounters with wild Pokemon almost entirely. But even with all of that, the Paldea region feels designed to be dominated by Fuecoco. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gyms in Scarlet and Violet don’t level scale, so if you have a bad matchup, you can just return once you’re able to power through a disadvantage. Still, the highest level gyms being Psychic/Fairy and Ice types, courtesy of Tulip and Grusha, and the two lowest level gyms being Katy and Brassius’ Bug and Grass types, means there’s a good reason to go with Fuecoco (and its Ghost type final evolution, Skeledirge) regardless of your strategy. Being a water type, Quaxly isn’t strong against any gym until it reaches its third form, Quaquaval, where it becomes a Fighting type, helping it in Larry’s Normal type gym. Sprigatito fares a bit better, evolving into Grass/Dark type Meowscarada, enabling it to best Tulip’s gym and Ryme’s Ghost gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Star base raids place even more importance on what starter you pick, being vital to the story progression of the game. The crews based around Dark and Poison Pokemon have an abundance of Bug Pokemon who have to be cleared before you can face the boss, while crews based around Fairy and Fighting types are perfect for Skeledirge, who is immune to attacks from the latter. Quaquaval and Meowscarada are worthy opponents for the first member of the Elite Four, Rika and her Ground Pokemon, but from Poppy’s Steel team onwards, Skeledirge finds itself miles ahead of the competition. </p><div id="the-best-starter-pokemon" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Starter Pokemon</h3><h3>The Best Starter Pokemon</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

You still get the full experience, including expansions like Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, plus all the classic side content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you missed it the first time around or just want to revisit Cyrodiil without modding your setup into oblivion (pun intended), this is the version to get. I think forty bucks is a fair ask for one of the most influential open-world RPGs of its time, especially with all the extras baked in.</p></div><p id="stray-ost-2-lp-vinyl"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Stray OST 2 LP Vinyl">Stray Soundtrack 2 LP Vinyl</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219127"><div id="219127" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stray Soundtrack 2 LP Vinyl</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pre-order: Releases Q4 2025</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t usually go for game soundtracks on vinyl unless they feel like something I’d actually sit down and listen to, and this one fits. Stray isn’t just a cat game. It’s a full-on atmosphere piece. The soundtrack blends synths and quiet texture with enough character that you can almost hear the neon signs buzzing. It’s available as a two-disc set on heavyweight black vinyl, and the packaging looks just as moody as the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you liked wandering those cyberpunk alleyways with nothing but low music and glowing signage for company, this is an easy recommendation. I think it’s the kind of record that holds up on its own, but also hits differently if you’ve played the game. Pre-orders are open now and ship in Q4 2025.</p></div><p id="cuktech-15-ultra"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="CUKTECH 15 Ultra">CUKTECH 15 Ultra Power Bank</h2></p><div catalogid="e029409f-0020-43ce-95ac-88650ab348d6" id="219124"><div id="219124" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>CUKTECH 15 Ultra Power Bank</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Don't forget the on-site coupon</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve gone through enough power banks to know when one’s actually designed with some thought behind it. This one pushes up to 140W with USB-C PD3.1, which means it can charge a MacBook or gaming handheld fast enough to matter. The smart display is a nice touch too. It shows real-time stats, not just another blinking light.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 20,000mAh capacity is plenty for multiple phone charges or a full laptop cycle, and the recharge time is quick if you’ve got the right charger.

These stay just outside your ears, but the sound quality still holds up thanks to Dolby Atmos and Snapdragon Sound support. And the fit’s more comfortable than most earbuds I’ve worn, especially for longer sessions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battery life is solid with up to fifty hours total from the case, and it includes features like auto volume adjustment and UV sterilization. It’s built for someone who actually uses their earbuds all day, not just in short bursts.

It’s six booster packs. That’s it. For $66.65.

It’s packed with great Kanto art, and yeah there's some killer hits in there. But paying twice retail for the chance at a Charizard? That’s a pass. I think if you’re going to spend over $60, you should at least know what you’re getting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I dug up some single card options that are actually worth the money.

This is Samsung’s top-of-the-line 49-inch ultrawide, and right now it’s a steal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dual QHD resolution makes games look absurdly sharp, and the 240Hz refresh rate with 0.03ms response time means it’s as fast as it is pretty.

Destiny 2’s original soundtrack is coming to vinyl, and it looks and sounds awesome. It covers music from The Red War campaign and comes with two LPs, custom art, and even a code for an exclusive in-game emblem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pre-ordered this the second I saw it. You don’t get a lot of game soundtracks that feel this cinematic, and now you can spin them while pretending Zavala’s giving you a pep talk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played Destiny for any length of time, you know how emotional this music can get.

You can load, edit, and transfer without watching a loading bar crawl across your screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s built to survive up to a 9.8-foot drop, which, yes, I find oddly specific.

It doesn’t hit the same crazy speeds, but it’s still great for moving big files and not worrying about losing them to the floor gods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this for backup storage or even game library overflow. It’s a solid pick if you don’t need bleeding-edge speeds but still want to keep everything in one pocket-sized vault.
