			<p>Following yesterday's rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-xvi-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Windows Central journalist Jez Corden that several Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Final Fantasy XVI, and the Pixel remasters were 'on the docket' for an Xbox port, another journalist, Alex Donaldson from VG247, provided an opposite outlook.</p>
<p>In a forum post <a href="https://icon-era.com/threads/alex-donaldson-there-is-presently-no-active-development-on-an-xbox-version-of-remake-or-rebirth.13960/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the IconEra board, Donaldson claimed that, to his knowledge, there's no active development on an Xbox version of either of the Final Fantasy VII remake titles released so far. He's confident that it will eventually happen, just not right now. He speculated that Square Enix would focus on completing the third part of the remake trilogy and only then look at Xbox (and possibly Nintendo Switch 2) porting.</p>
<p>Donaldson subsequently added that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company-wide policy change for the new multiplatform strategy</a> inevitably takes time to be applied, so there might be unannounced Square Enix games that have been in development targeting the usual platforms (PlayStation and PC) since they were started before the changes, and it might not make financial sense to change that target when they are at a late stage of development. Fans should be warned that if that turns out to be the case, it won't mean that Square Enix has shifted its strategy again.</p>
<p>Donaldson ends his post reiterating that things could have changed 'really recently', but last he heard, there were no development plans to port Final Fantasy VII Remake and/or Rebirth to Xbox presently. However, he added that Final Fantasy XVI is a different matter, and it may well happen sooner than the other games.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Final Fantasy XVI will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Tuesday, September 17, for PC</a>, around fifteen months after its PlayStation 5 debut. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may follow a similar trajectory, which would put its PC release somewhere around May 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-gone%E2%80%99s-director-slams-bend-studio-for-not-%E2%80%98protecting-its-legacy%E2%80%99-in-astro-bot-ad.975087/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-director-slams-bend-studio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Days Gone was released on PlayStation 4 in 2019, emerging as a solid enough open-world, post-apocalyptic shooter with some innovative elements. It was a bit of a performance-based nightmare at launch, but it levelled out quite nicely and was eventually ported to PC, offering players on two platforms an enjoyable end-of-the-world experience.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, despite the potential of the universe for expansion and another game, Bend Studio announced some time ago that it wouldn’t be pursuing a sequel, leaving the title to rust and age, confined to the abyss of history. That has never sat well with the game’s director, who recently spoke out against Bend Studio for using Days Gone’s protagonist to ‘promote other games’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-days-gone-by">Days Gone By</h2>



<p>To celebrate the launch of Astro Bot, Bend Studio posted a picture of Deacon St. John, the main character from Days Gone, watching other Astro Bot characters play on a beach. By way of a response, John Garvin, one of the writers and directors working on Days Gone, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kinda sad that Deek <em>(Deacon St. John)</em> has been reduced to promoting other games … well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Garvin <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1832243904172978646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has taken to social media</a> to vent his frustrations regarding the abandonment of Days Gone. The gaming industry veteran departed Bend Studio in 2019, months after the release of Days Gone, and he has always rued how his game was treated in the years that followed.</p>



<p>He doubled down in the comments on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Haha, I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill promoting some small game and I’m being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I enjoyed Days Gone and rinsed the game as much as possible, collecting every trophy and exploring the vast world it presented. In particular, I was fond of the game’s ‘horde mechanic’, which allowed for hundreds of enemies to charge at the player in an instant, often making for some of the most intense fights I’ve ever had in a game.</p>



<p>It’s a shame that Days Gone was forgotten by Bend Studio, but it’s not the first franchise the team has had to give up on. It’s not a good look for Garvin to be defending his title like this on social media and he’s receiving plenty of flak for it, but it’s not impossible to see where he’s coming from.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed, and Others Referenced in Astro Bot Credits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-credits-reference-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-and-others-referenced-in-astro-bot-credits.975081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-credits-reference-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been noticed by eagle-eyed gamers that several references to games <strong>not featured </strong>in Astro Bot have surfaced in the game’s credits, suggesting that they’ll be added in post-launch updates. There’s a sizeable list that includes the likes of Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed, Worms, and Rise of the Ronin, leaving users to wonder in what capacity they’ll be added to the game that was released just a few days ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-that-ll-be-interesting">Stellar Blade? That’ll Be Interesting</h2>



<p>The ‘Asstro Bot’ comments have already started appearing online.</p>



<p>In the credits for Astro Bot, several key franchises appear without having a spot in the base game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Worms</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>



<li>Rise of the Ronin</li>



<li>Rayman</li>



<li>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>



<li>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fbgfsk/stellar_blade_worms_rise_of_the_ronin_multiple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goldenboss6 on Reddit</a> for the list</em></p>



<p>Players have been enjoying the plethora of crossovers and collaborations in Astro Bot, but the team certainly isn’t done yet and there’s still plenty to draw from in the world of PlayStation. Stellar Blade certainly is an interesting title to feature on the list. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the post-apocalyptic slasher was released to a positive reception but gained most of its attention online because of how voluptuous the protagonist is. As players explore Stellar Blade, they can unlock a series of outfits, some of which leave utterly nothing to the imagination.</p>



<p>Rayman, Worms, or Croc write themselves perfectly into a cutesy game like Astro Bot, but it’ll be interesting to see how the likes of Stellar Blade are brought up.</p>



<p>Astro Bot was released on September 6, pulling in extremely positive reviews across the board and being declared Game of the Year by many users.</p>



<p>Have you given it a go yet? What franchise would you most like to see brought into the fold?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/th0mashd-gives-his-thoughts-going-into-day-2-of-fortnite-globals.975027/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/th0mashd-gives-his-thoughts-going-into-day-2-of-fortnite-globals/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The popular European Fortnite competitor, Th0masHD, finished off day one of Fortnite Globals in second place with his teammate, Queasy. The two players dominated but still fell almost 150 points behind first. Th0masHD, one of the most decorative and famous Fortnite players in the world, has never actually gotten first place in an FNCS event. </p>



<p>I was able to sit down with the player after day one to get his thoughts on what needs to happen for him and his duo to grab first during the second and final day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-th0mashd-prepares-for-day-2-of-fortnite-globals">Th0masHD Prepares For Day 2 Of Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>Ending day one, the duo was able to hold second place as their own. The team, however, ended with only six points more than third place. This means the duo will have to be on their toes going into the final day of competition tomorrow.</p>



<p>“Obviously, it feels good to end in second on the first day,” said Th0masHD in an exclusive interview. “But tomorrow is what truly matters.”</p>



<p>While the first day of the Fortnite Global Championship was the standard FNCS format, the second day will have a 1.5x point multiplier, meaning any duo could make a massive comeback.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“We will definitely go and look at some of the games we played today and see what people are doing and what we need to do for tomorrow.”</p>



<p>But with a successful performance coming out of day one, does the duo need to prepare differently than usual for tomorrow?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-th0mashd-talks-what-him-and-queasy-need-to-do-in-tomorrow-s-6-games">Th0masHD Talks What Him And Queasy Need To Do In Tomorrow’s 6 Games</h2>



<p>The duo still has a heavy amount of points they need to achieve before taking home the Fortnite Global Championship trophy, as the team keeps their heads high going into tomorrow’s final six games.</p>



<p>“I think we played good today,” said Th0masHD when asked how he felt about his duo’s performance during day one’s games. “I think we played the best we could. Perfect, to be honest. It was really only game one that we played sort of badly.”</p>



<p>So, what will the duo going into tomorrow’s finale?</p>



<p>“I think we need to stick to the plan and do the same today.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team’s win happened when the two capitalized on height, with Th0masHD ensuring the ultimate height play while Queasy dragged out from a few layers below him.</p>



<p>“The first game we were able to hold height perfectly. It was basically a free win.”</p>



<p>While the two are feeling confident going into day two, they will need to make sure not to let their guards down, as many other players will have it out for them.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industrial-annihilation">Industrial Annihilation</a> is a mashup Planetary Annihilation (big robot armies do battle on a planet) with factory management such as Factorio (conveyor belts conveyor belts conveyor belts). When we last checked in with it back in January, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/industrial-annihilation-is-a-planetary-annihilation-successor-with-factory-building">funding via StartEngine</a> with an ambitious eye towards a spring Early Access release.
</p>
<p>Now it's September and it's just got done being successfully funded <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/indannihilation/industrial-annihilation/description">via Kickstarter</a>, with a probably-still-ambitious eye towards an Early Access release before the end of 2024.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Kickstarter successfully hit its £152,299 ($200k) funding goal and went on to raise a total of £233,597. That unlocked the first three of several possible stretch goals, including an original soundtrack release and the addition of some extra skins and an extra unit. The funding amount is on top of $820,284.30 (around £624k) raised <a href="https://www.startengine.com/offering/industrialannihilation">via the StartEngine campaign earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for video games to raise capital through multiple platforms on their way to release. StartEngine also differs from Kickstarter in that it's an investment platform, not a crowdfunding tool.
</p>
<p>I never got on with Planetary Annihilation, but I did love Supreme Commander, which is part of the same messy family of spiritually related robot strategy games. Much of that love came from the challenge of efficiently constructing a base with which to churn out units within Supreme Commander's easily crashed economy. A similar game, more specifically focused on the joy of factory efficiency, sounds like it could be great.

            <p>Godus developer Peter Molyneux thinks that generative AI is going to be a "real game changer" in video games, and that everyone will be able to "create a game from one single prompt such as 'Make a battle royale set on a pirate ship.'" These were among Molyneux's predictions for where video games would be in 25 years.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"AI is going to be a real game changer. There will come a time where AI will be used to create huge parts of a game - AI-generated characters, animations, dialogue, VO, there is so much that AI will be able to tackle," Molyneux told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-will-games-be-in-25-years">Eurogamer</a>, who spoke to many industry figures about their visions of the future.
</p>
<p>"And finally, I think that AI will open the doors to everyone and allow anyone to make games. You will be able to, for example, create a game from one single prompt such as 'Make a battle royale set on a pirate ship' and your AI will go and do that for you."
</p>
<p>Molyneux also predicted that movies and video games would continue to intermix. "I think Hollywood are going to continue to be fascinated with games and keep on coming for more game stories and narrative. The success of Fallout and, to some degree, the Witcher, and the deal between Remedy and Annapurna to bring Control and Alan Wake to the big screen, shows that games have the kinds of worlds where Hollywood can really get stuck in."
</p>
<p>I think a lot about <a href="https://youtu.be/BtxwATMd_bE?si=HKgXt4Q_CMzbfCkl">this video profile of Molyneux</a> as he worked on Legacy, his last released game. It's filled with quotes that seem to echo backwards and forwards through his career, collecting dramatic irony. 
</p>
<p>"That's what I always think about when we employ people. They're giving us the most valuable thing: a little slice of their lives. And if we don't do something good then how terrible that would be," Molyneux says in his enthusiastic whisper.
</p>
<p>During development, Legacy converted to an blockchain game, seemingly jettisoned many of its features and narrative, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneuxs-next-game-has-sold-40-million-in-nfts">reportedly sold £40 million in land deed NFTs before release</a>. It's basically unplayable now. How terrible indeed! 
</p>
<p>"I've had loads of excuses in the past. I've never done anything on this platform before - excuse. I haven't got enough money - excuse. I haven't got the right team - excuse. Now it's just down to our dedication and passion, finding the soul of what is going to be a great game," he told Red Bull Gaming five years ago.
</p>
<p>Now that Legacy is a disaster, Molyneux's excuse is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance">that they were "sold" on the idea of the blockchain by the publisher</a>, and that he's "not a person that deeply understands it." Never mind that he popped up in Las Vegas in 2021 to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832188/peter-molyneux-22cans-gala-nft-blockchain-business-simulator-game-interview">talk up all the supposed benefits of blockchain gaming</a>. "We’ve got this unbelievable simulation, this incredible narrative we weave through the game. We’ve got moral choices in there and competing against each other, all within this totally new world, which is, of course, exactly what blockchain is all about." 
</p>
<p>Remember: Molyneux doesn't talk to the press anymore, and no longer overprimises. Although the resonant quotes don't just come from Moylneux.
</p>
<p>"We wanted to make a game that was about building things. I think there's two reasons for that. I love building things, I think Peter loves the idea of other people building things," explains Paul McLaughlin, Legacy's art director. "I think he wants to enable the audience to experience some of this stuff that maybe he doesn't really quite get himself."
</p>
<p>In that context, you can see why Molyneux would be drawn to generative AI, a tool that claims to help other people build things, and which is most beloved by people who fundamentally don't quite "get" creativity themselves. 
</p>
<p>Molyneux and his studio 22cans are now working on Masters Of Albion, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-is-back-with-new-god-sim-masters-of-albion-which-looks-like-a-stripped-down-black-white">new god game that seems to revive some of Legacy's features</a>. Much of the reporting around the game has been generous, and much of the criticism of Molyneux gets categorised as taking issue with his "overpromising." I disagree with both, because there's a difference between being a moon-eyed overpromiser - what Steve Hogarty <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/godus/an-interview-with-peter-molyneux">described</a> as "an unerringly passionate ouroboros of promises and sadness" - and being deliberately misleading.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The action has been heating up more and more as the Fortnite Global Championship 2024 event continues to progress. With only one game left on the first day of competition, Peterbot and Pollo manage to grab their first Victory Royale, putting them in first place for the time being, 50 points ahead of second.</p>



<p>The team had almost managed to make this their second Victory Royale, as Peterbot threw away a win during an intense 1v1 during an endgame earlier in the tournament.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-peterbot-and-pollo-announce-they-are-winning-fortnite-globals-after-first-victory-royale">Peterbot And Pollo Announce They Are Winning Fortnite Globals After First Victory Royale</h2>



<p>With a six-game format for the first day, Peterbot and Pollo had found themselves teetering on the line of second and third place during most of Fortnite Globals. While the team had made it to pretty much every single endgame, they were never able to capitalize on the momentum that got them that far.</p>



<p>At one point, Peterbot threw away a win after losing an intense 1v1 to end the game. The saddest part was that he had the height and health advantage to win the fight.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That was not enough, though, to bring the duo down in their spirits, as the two decided to ramp up the energy in game five, taking home their first Victory Royale.</p>



<p>And that Victory Royale… put them in first place, more than 50 points ahead of second place. </p>



<p>The question is, can the duo continue this momentum? Or will it end up being short-lived?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-peterbot-and-pollo-win-it-all">Will Peterbot And Pollo Win It All? </h2>



<p>Will the duo be able to capitalize on the momentum that has carried them this far in the Fortnite Global Championship 2024 event? With an additional game left during the day’s tournament and one more day of six games, the duo will have to push past their limits to create the name they are hoping to certify themselves as.</p>



<p>When interviewed after their win, Peterbot announced to the stadium: “We are winning it all.”</p>



<p>So, will the duo be able to take home the massive $400,000 prize? Or will the team mimic Peterbot’s actions during the game where he threw away the win?</p>

            <p>Shinji Mikami, founder of Tango Gameworks, thought the studio would be "safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games." Mikami was asked about the studio's closure by Microsoft earlier this year, and its revival under new owners Krafton at Gamescom last month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I had thought the studio would be safe as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games. That’s one of the reasons I left Tango Gameworks. So I was surprised when the studio was closed down," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shinji-mikami-and-goichi-interview-tango-gameworks-shadows-of-the-damned">Mikami told IGN</a>.
</p>
<p>"Now Krafton has taken over the business, so I feel like it worked out well in the end. I was reminded that if you make a good game, someone will pick it up. The hard work of the Hi-Fi Rush development team led to a new chapter for the company. I think that for a development studio, making a good game is more directly related to survival than making a popular game."
</p>
<p>Mikami was being interviewed alongside fellow designer Goichi Suda, who called Tango Gamework's closure "a bolt from the blue." Suda and Mikami worked together on Shadows Of The Damned, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campy-suda-51-and-shinji-mikami-joint-shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-gets-halloween-release-date">remaster of which is being released later this year</a>.
</p>
<p>Mikami is best known for his work in the survival horror genre, directing Resident Evils 1 and 4 at Capcom and the Evil Within series at Tango Gameworks. He's spoken previously about wanting to leave Tango Gameworks long before he did in order to move away from the genre. It makes sense that he'd see the critical success of Hi-Fi Rush - a game which he mentored but did not direct - as the opportunity for him to leave with the studio's future secured.
</p>
<p>Microsoft announced that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">were closing Tango Gameworks alongside other layoffs and studio closures in May this year</a>. In August, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">publisher Krafton acquired the studio and the IP rights to Hi-Fi Rush</a>, with plans to hire back some of the studio's staff.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the ongoing Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Open Beta weekend well underway, countless thousands want to hop into a multiplayer round and test out the competitive first-person shooter. Unfortunately, those playing on Xbox find themselves encountering numerous issues. Is your Black Ops 6 beta not working on Xbox? Here are a few potential fixes!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-the-black-ops-6-beta-not-working-on-xbox-systems">How to Fix the Black Ops 6 Beta Not Working on Xbox Systems</h2>



<p>First and foremost, you’re not the only one suffering from the Black Ops 6 Open Beta not working as intended on Xbox. It’s a widespread problem that—hopefully—Activision intends to address before the weekend ends. For now, attempt the following fixes to see if you can get into the game:</p>



<ul>
<li>From the Xbox dashboard, select Manage Game and Add On under Call of Duty. In the Saved Data section, delete the Reserve Space, which is approximately 12 GB. Before leaving this settings menu, ensure the content packs, including the Black Ops 6 beta packs, are installed. Try to launch the game!</li>



<li>You may need to clear your Xbox cache. To do so, turn off the console and remove the power cables. Let it sit for approximately two minutes, then plug everything back in and power the system back on. This downtime resets your system’s cache, clearing out any corrupted files.</li>



<li>Your game may require an update, as Activision is tweaking the experience throughout the weekend. To check, select Black Ops 6 from your Xbox Dashboard, choose Manage Game and Add Ons, then navigate to Updates. If there’s anything here waiting for you, go ahead and download the patch and then relaunch the game.</li>
</ul>



<p>You may need to uninstall and reinstall the game if all else fails.</p>

<p>The Halo Championship Series’ Salt Lake City Major is here and the best teams in the world are fighting for the lion’s share of a $250,000 prize pool. It’s the final Major before the Halo World Championship takes place in Seattle, and some of the biggest names in gaming have taken to the stage.</p>



<p>As the Pool Play round unravels, the likes of Spacestation and Complexity are skyrocketing up the charts, closely followed by Shopify Rebellion and FaZe Clan. It’s the usual suspects, of course – but OpTic Gaming, ITB, and Pure aren’t far behind.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-underdog-spirit">Underdog Spirit</h2>



<p>Surprisingly, it isn’t just the big players that are aiming for the top spot in Salt Lake City. There’s an underdog force in the form of Alpha Esports, a South American squad with nothing but the most minor wins under its belt. The squad came up through the Open Bracket, which consisted of 64 teams whittled down to just four.</p>



<p>In Pool A, Alpha Esports has already beaten Ascending Baseline and Sentinels, losing only against a dominant Spacestation side. That’s enough to give the team qualification to the next stage.</p>



<p>This short-form tournament wraps up tomorrow, but there’s enough action being packed into that tight schedule to keep Halo fans the world over entertained.</p>



<p>At this point, the top eight teams remaining in the competition will land qualification for the Halo World Championship, and the top team will net 100,000 HCS points <strong>and </strong>the $100,000 grand prize. </p>



<p>In July, Spacestation claimed the win at the Atlanta Major, beating OpTic Gaming in a tense grand final, and before that, FaZe hit the top spot in London, again beating OpTic in the grand final. In March, Spacestation secured yet another trophy, beating… You guessed it – OpTic Gaming in the grand final.</p>



<p>OpTic Gaming hasn’t secured a win in the HCS since last September, so this event marks a year since the team picked up a victory. In October, it’ll be a year since FaZe Clan won the Halo World Championship, leaving OpTic Gaming in… Second place.</p>



<p>Will OpTic Gaming finally lift a trophy in Salt Lake City?</p>



<p>Will Alpha Esports defy the odds and produce a win?</p>



<p>Or will Spacestation continue a dominant spree and win for the third time this season?</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming for all the latest.</p>

<p>Astro Bot is taking the PlayStation world by storm. It provides a fun experience from the start that capitalizes on what we love most about video games. But as of right now, it’s only available on PS5. Many people are out there anxiously watching everyone else have fun, waiting for their turn. So, will Astro Bot come to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-astro-bot-launching-on-pc">Is Astro Bot Launching on PC?</h2>



<p>As of right now, there is no official word on whether Astro Bot will launch on PC. If you look back at Astro’s Playroom, it remained a PlayStation-exclusive title, never released on PC like many other Sony titles. However, in recent years, we’ve seen PlayStation making a massive push to capitalize on the PC gaming market by launching its titles on Steam. They’ve had immense success in doing so, too.</p>



<p>One of the most significant selling points of the Astro titles is in its DualSense functionality, but that’s no longer an issue on PC, as you can connect a PS5 controller and play PlayStation titles via Steam without any problem. There’s really nothing holding the team back from launching on PC besides a push to sell systems.</p>



<p>Furthermore, regarding hype from PC players, studio director Nicolas Doucet said, “We want to hear from you. Absolutely. We want to hear from you.” It’s entirely possible that Astro Bot comes to PC in the near future!</p>







<h2 id="h-could-high-astro-bot-sales-lead-to-a-pc-launch">Could High Astro Bot Sales Lead to a PC Launch?</h2>



<p>It’s entirely possible, and highly likely, that if Astro Bot sales continue to skyrocket, PlayStation may wish to push into additional markets and systems by launching the game on Steam. However, they typically launch on Valve’s digital storefront many months, if not years, after the initial release on PlayStation systems. </p>



<p>Just recently, it came to light that Astro Bot sales were so high that it’s the best-selling retail game on Amazon and completely sold out on Amazon Japan!</p>

It also, inadvertently, highlights the dearth of new games and franchises really worth celebrating from the PS5 era. Also, <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>is a game with a staggering gulf between its highs and lows, and although plenty of people are railing against the <em>Minecraft </em>movie after getting a first glimpse of it this week, the film knows its audience and will likely delight them. These are just some of the opinions you can read (and then agree or disagree with!) in the pages ahead.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="23304706ff30567e5a15bf23a966bb6e" data-recommend-id="image://23304706ff30567e5a15bf23a966bb6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="23304706ff30567e5a15bf23a966bb6e" data-recommend-id="image://23304706ff30567e5a15bf23a966bb6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I was staring at a wall.

The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020.

<p>Popular creators and Fortnite competitors, Sommerset and BlakePS shared their thoughts just before the beginning of the Fortnite Global Championship 2024. With the best Fortnite players in the world competing against each other in Texas, both of the popular creators gave some valuable insight heading into the tournament.</p>



<h2 id="h-blakeps-gives-his-insight-on-what-competing-in-person-is-like">BlakePS Gives His Insight On What Competing In-Person Is Like</h2>



<p>If you have been a part of the Fortnite scene for a while, you understand that BlakePS is one of the G.O.A.T.S. The player has been around for quite some time now, cementing himself as a top competitor in Fortnite history. Now, sitting back and taking on the role of a spectator, Blake gave his insight into what it is like to compete in person.</p>



<p>“Most of these pros on this stage are experienced,” said Blake when being interviewed by popular Fortnite-personality, Leven2k. “I don’t think the nerves are really affecting them.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blake, in the past, has competed in various LAN events, giving him the experience many gamers long for going into large tournaments as such.</p>



<p>“And for the new-timers, like the one-time LAN qualifiers, they are going to feel it for the first game dropping in, but once they land on that map, they are going to be good. The nerves are gone. They’re locked in. They are ready to win.”</p>



<p>With Fortnite having one of the youngest competitor bases out there, many of these newcomers are still in their mid-teens, making this easily the biggest event they have ever presented themselves in front of others for.</p>



<h2 id="h-sommerset-exclaims-her-excitement-for-globals-and-her-own-upcoming-fortnite-event">Sommerset Exclaims her Excitement For Globals And Her Own Upcoming Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Alongside BlakePS was the popular Fortnite streamer, Sommerset, who shared her excitement going into Fortnite Globals and talked a bit about her own event coming up.</p>



<p>“Stressed, happy, excited; I don’t know. All of those emotions, I guess,” said Sommerset when discussing Globals and her very own upcoming Fortnite tournament.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But aside from the stress, Sommerset made sure to talk about how ecstatic she has been about the current Globals event. </p>



<p>“It’s been amazing. Meeting the fans at the event has been a surreal experience. I couldn’t expect anything more.”</p>



<p>With the event being underway, many more creators are in attendance, such as SypherPK, Lachlan and more. </p>

            <p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, says the feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to the team's Discord server, the team said that it "value[s players'] opinions" and hopes to "fulfil all [player] requests in future updates" but stopped short of detailing what these may be.</p>

<p>The team did, however, address two immediate issues.</p>
<p>"Since the start of Season 2, we've received a lot of feedback," the team admitted. "Some of it has been quite demoralising, but what's important is that it's made us aware of how your experience has been affected by the changes we've made. We want to discuss some of these issues today.</p>
<p>"We value your opinions and hope that we'll be able to fulfil all of your requests in future updates. Our development team is making optimisations in response to two major issues that players have raised, which we'd like your feedback on as well!"</p>
<p>The two issues Starry Studio indentifies concern weapon builds and scenario tags, acknowledging that some players thought they were "designed poorly" whilst others complain that there weren't enough high-difficulty tags in the first place.</p>
<p>To combat the former, the team is introducing a blueprint conversion system that essentially permits players to switch armour and weapon ratings, enabling them to better tailor their loadout to their playstyles.</p>
<p>The latter requires a little more thought, however, which is why Starry Studio is inviting players to complete yet another survey to help them better ascertain what players are after.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it last month for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>In related news, the Once Human team is set to begin testing its mobile port on 19th September. It's unclear if the mobile version supports crossplay, but it seems unlikely given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-humans-latest-patch-is-here-but-controller-support-still-isnt">Once Human doesn't even support controllers</a> or Steam cloud yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/forever-winter-solo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Whenever there’s a new extraction shooter on the horizon, there’s a single question that many ask. Can you play solo? Despite the core concept of most extraction shooters revolving around squad play, a rather large and growing number of players don’t want to deal with a teammate. It’s an additional risk. Will they shoot you in the back for your loot? Will they hold you back? So, can you play The Forever Winter solo?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-solo-play-viable-in-the-forever-winter">Is Solo Play Viable in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>Unlike many of the more hardcore extraction shooters, which either force you to play with a squad or deter you from going at it solo, The Forever Winter hopes to capitalize on numerous play styles and preferences. Playing solo in The Forever Winter from day one will be entirely viable, with players able to tackle all of the game’s missions and objectives without needing a human party.</p>



<p>In fact, during a recent AMA on Discord, developer Fun Dog Studios said that you can play the entire game solo, and sometimes you can get away with tackling a raid without ever firing a single shot. It’s a viable play style and one some of the developers in the studio often utilize.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-hire-ai-companions-in-the-forever-winter">Can You Hire AI Companions in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>To ensure you’re not at a severe disadvantage when playing The Forever Winter alone, a mechanic in-game on day one allows solo players to hire recruits. These recruits are companion NPCs that follow your orders. You can command them to defend a specific spot, follow you, stay in place, or attack an enemy. </p>



<p>They stated that these “AI buddies” would be available <em>from time to time</em> when you cannot or don’t want to match with other players. I’m curious to see if this is a mechanic you can utilize every raid or if there’s a cooldown.</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that you know you can play the game solo, is The Forever Winter on your radar? If it is, you might want to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forever-winter-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the game’s system requirements</a> first!</p>

It’s a bold ambition, to see <em>Resident Evil 7</em> on a tablet. So it’s a shame the project has been pretty disastrous, the games barely shifting any copies. And Capcom’s reaction? Make it far, far more inconvenient to play them. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-village-capcom-ios-apple-1851637885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-village-capcom-ios-apple-1851637885">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0a1781cf4235f196c4f78153fc45254" data-recommend-id="image://e0a1781cf4235f196c4f78153fc45254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows one of the portraits." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows one of the portraits." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0a1781cf4235f196c4f78153fc45254" data-recommend-id="image://e0a1781cf4235f196c4f78153fc45254" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows one of the portraits." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/age-of-mythology-untold-remake-worlds-edge-microsoft-1851636612&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/age-of-mythology-untold-remake-worlds-edge-microsoft-1851636612"><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></a></span> is out today on Xbox and PC. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/age-of-mythology-retold/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Critics seem to like it</a></span> and people who paid extra to play early are mostly happy with this remastered version of the classic 2002 PC strategy game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It is 9PM, and all I want to do is sleep. I barely have the energy to speak, let alone play a video game. But I have a job to do, and it’s reviewing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167370/astro-bot-ps5-sequel-trailer-date"><em>Astro Bot</em> by its release date</a>, so I make a deal with myself to play just two levels, then go to bed…</p><p>Five hours later, my face burns from smiling. I’m convinced I could build, then run through, a brick wall. That’s the type of way <em>Astro Bot</em> will make you feel.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out">out now on PlayStation 5</a>, is a collect-a-thon platformer. You play as the robot Astro adventuring in space in his PS5-shaped mothership with 300 of his friends — some of them simple bots, others robot-ified versions of famous video game characters. Suddenly, he’s attacked by an unsubtle-as-hell Xbox-green alien monster who trashes his ship and scatters its parts and his 300 friends to far corners of the universe.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is filled with standard platformer tropes, but it pulls off a sense of wonder in their presentation. As you explore galaxies to find your fellow robots and unlock new parts of the game, you’ll find a lot of familiar elements, only to see them executed in quirky and delightful ways. Just about every platformer has an ability that lets you shoot across longer distances, but none of them let you do it by strapping a bulldog to your back.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The bulldog power-up acts like a rocket to propel you across big gaps.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Team Asobi</cite></p></div><p>The different levels Astro explores have themes that you’d expect. There’s a jungle planet, a volcano planet, and worlds of pirates, ghosts, and gardeners. Some worlds require special powers to navigate, and those, too, are pretty standard in function if not in form. The monkey power-up lets you scale walls, while the mouse ability shrinks you down to access tiny spaces. There’s even a <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>-esque F.L.U.D.D power that uses liquid to move Astro around.</p><div><p>I’m convinced I could build, then run through, a brick wall. That’s the type of way <em>Astro Bot</em> will make you feel</p></div><p>The developers at Team Asobi didn’t reinvent the platforming wheel here, but like any good platformer, it’s the unique ways the powers are used that make them special. Instead of water, that F.L.U.D.D. power-up sucks up a green goo it then spits out to create platforms of grass. I giggled like a toddler using it to defeat a special enemy by literally sucking its green, goopy brains out.&nbsp;</p><p>One power-up —&nbsp;which I won’t describe beyond saying it’s <em>really cute</em> since figuring it out is a big part of the fun here —&nbsp;truly captures the essence of <em>Astro Bot</em>. When I first found it, I could not understand it at all. It seemed useless; I felt silly for getting stumped by what had been, up until that point, an incredibly simple game. And unlike with most of my pickups, the game wouldn’t help me. <em>Astro Bot</em> typically displays a little tutorial box for how to use it, but this time, it deliberately left me hanging. Playing a game is like being in a conversation with its developers without the ability to speak directly, and it felt like communication had broken down.</p><p>But then I remembered that communication between player and developer is not only what to do but also what to <em>feel. </em>And<em> </em>suddenly, it felt like they were hovering just over my shoulder, holding back their laughter as a dear friend would while they waited for me to get a joke. They’d intentionally held back an explanation because they wanted me to experience the feeling of figuring it out for myself. They wanted me to laugh, like I suspect they did when designing it.</p><p>And when I finally got it, the jolt of understanding was so friggin’ powerful that I laughed myself into spontaneous sobbing saying aloud to no one, “<em>Astro Bo</em>t, I would <em>die</em> for you.”&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>He gets by with a little help from his PlayStation friends.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Team Asobi</cite></p></div><p>There are so many moments exactly like that. I thought bots you rescued were simply currency used to advance to the next level, only to realize that in the game’s hub world, they’re your friends putting their very bodies on the line to help you access even more collectibles. Some distinctive PlayStation-themed bots —&nbsp;think one wearing Aloy’s red hair or Kratos’ beard — serve a more special purpose. When you rescue them, they can give you that character’s power and take you to a special level modeled on a game like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>, so detailed that they’ll even include side quests from the original. And I defy you to feel something other than the warmest nostalgia during the final boss fight and credits sequence — I didn’t know just how much emotion a PlayStation Move controller could make me feel.</p><p>From my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">two-hour demo at Summer Game Fest</a> earlier this year, I knew <em>Astro Bot</em> would be something special. It was a simple, joyous little platformer crafted as a celebration of PlayStation’s past. And if that’s all it was, it’d make for a great little pit stop on the 2024 game calendar as we travel toward the bigger, more anticipated releases like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><p>But <em>Astro Bot</em> is so much more than a mascot platformer plucked from the late ’90s and retooled for modern audiences and hardware. It is the kind of game that reminds us why video games exist in the first place: love. (Yeah, I know that sounds corny — but I’m serious.) <em>Astro Bot</em> exemplifies the great love that compels us to play, make, write about, and share video games with our friends and family. Even if it will keep you up way past your bedtime.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
