            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-release-date-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox's Sims-like life-sim <em>Life By You </em>has been delayed again, and thus the <em>Life By You</em> release date will not be June 4th. That was the previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/early-access-release-of-sims-like-game-life-by-you-delayed-again-by-paradox" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Early Access Release of The Sims-Like Game Life by You Delayed Again by Paradox">release date announced </a>back in March.</p>

<p>This is actually the third<em> </em>time for a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/early-access-of-sims-like-game-life-by-you-delayed" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Early Access of Sims-Like Game Life by You Delayed by Several Months"><em>Life by You </em>delay</a>, as it was also delayed in July 2023, from a planned September release date. It may be that following the very rough launch of <em>Cities Skylines 2</em>, the publisher is being cautious with a new game releasing, and making sure that its early access state is good enough to stand up to scrutiny.</p>

<h2>What is the <em>Life By You</em> Release Date?</h2>

<p>There is no new release window or date for <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-life-by-you-release-date.1680458/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" An Update on &quot;Life By You&quot; release date"><em>Life By You</em> in the Paradox announcement</a>. Instead, they state they want to avoid committing to a date that they might be unable to meet, requiring a fourth delay potentially.</p>

<p>The full <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/life-by-you" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Life By You"><em>Life By You</em></a> delay statement is:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>
After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th. This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed.</p><p>
While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window, we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet.</p><p>
We will provide more information as soon as possible, until then we want to sincerely thank you for your continued support and patience.</p><p>
Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO of Paradox Interactive</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Beyond the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2redemption-update-mods" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Cities: Skylines 2 Starts on Road to Redemption With Big Update and Mods"><em>Cities Skylines 2 </em>issues </a>that have plagued its launch, its possible that Paradox might be concerned about the increasing number of games targetting the Life sim subgenre, with games like <em>Paralives </em>and <em>Afterlife</em> in the works. With more Sims-like games in the works, having a higher caliber product at the early access launch may help it start strong and sustain in a market place that will have more competition then they may have expected when they signed the game.</p>

<!-- cache hit 70:single/related:80aaffde70587f1549d8ca9fba24dbb3 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Just a couple of years ago, companies like Nvidia were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/500-hz-asus-monitor-promises-fewer-visual-artifacts-less-latency-than-ever/">talking up prototype 500 Hz gaming monitors</a> as having "benefits [for] every game and gamer, not just competitive games and esports pros." Now, the high frame rate experts at Blur Busters <a href="https://blurbusters.com/displayweek-2024-news-4k-1000hz-monitor-exhibited-and-new-blur-busters-display-tester/">bring word</a> of a 4K, 1,000 Hz prototype screen being shown off by <a href="https://en.tclcsot.com/">Chinese panel maker TCL CSOT</a> at <a href="https://www.displayweek.org/">the manufacturer-focused DisplayWeek 2024 conference</a>.</p>
<p>TCL's proof-of-concept panel is all the more impressive for not sacrificing resolution in the name of its high frame rate—many current 480 Hz monitors tend to top out at 1080p resolutions or offer "dual mode" options for higher resolutions at lower maximum refresh rates. And while <a href="https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=8388#p64988">recent advancements in pixel-flipping times</a> have enabled TCL's LCD prototype, Blur Busters estimates that 1,000 Hz OLED displays could be commercialized as soon as 2027.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>— Blur Busters (@BlurBusters) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlurBusters/status/1790773962563273119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The apparent, impending breaking of the four-digit refresh rate threshold got us thinking: Are we finally approaching a point of diminishing returns in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/05/480-hz-desktop-laptop-displays-teased-by-pc-panel-pusher-auo/">monitor-makers' long-running battle of the Hz</a>? Or is 1,000 Hz just the latest stepping stone to realms of motion smoothness yet unimagined by most gamers?</p>
<h2>60 fps is just the start</h2>
<p>Research suggests that most humans <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298007">stop detecting flickering in lights pulsing at around 60 Hz</a>, a finding that has led many to erroneously claim that the human eye "can't see beyond 60 fps." The misunderstanding stems in part from the fact that this "flicker threshold" generally measures how a human reacts to flickering in a single light source. The eye's reaction to the illusion of motion in a display made up of millions of individual pixels can be quite different.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>A simple <a href="https://www.testufo.com/">motion test</a> on a high-end monitor is enough to clearly demonstrate the advantages of refresh rates beyond 60 Hz. Fast-moving on-screen objects look decidedly less blurry as you climb higher and higher on the refresh rate curve, because the pixels from the object's previous position "persist" for less time at higher rates. This low persistence can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/oculus-creates-a-new-open-source-unit-of-time-to-measure-frame-rates/">especially important in virtual reality displays</a>, where motion blurring and lower refresh rates can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/11/major-game-publishers-express-concern-about-vrs-motion-sickness-problem/">lead</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/09/valve-blames-developers-for-lingering-vr-nasuea-issues/">motion sickness</a> as you tilt your head quickly around a virtual environment.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Fast-moving objects appear decidedly less blurry as you climb the frame rate curve.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once displays get to about 1,000 Hz, that's when Blur Busters says you start to see results where <a href="https://forums.blurbusters.com/viewtopic.php?t=9552">"things stop motion blurring."</a> But even faster refresh rates could help with the apparent sharpness of extremely fast objects on Ultra HD displays—think of a mouse pointer or video game crosshair that can move across the roughly 4,000 horizontal pixels on a 4K display in a single second. To eliminate the <a href="https://blurbusters.com/the-stroboscopic-effect-of-finite-framerate-displays/">stroboscopic effects</a> that can happen on objects moving that quickly, you might need a theoretical display of 10,000 Hz or more.</p>
<p>Of course, even with a 1,000 Hz monitor, you'll need content running at 1,000 frames per second to take full advantage of the ultra-fast pixel-flipping hardware. While that level of performance might sound ludicrous for current hardware running any modern games, that kind of performance is no longer as unattainable as you might think. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/frames-win-games/">Nvidia data</a> shows the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">RTX 4090</a> generating 600+ fps frame rates on aging-but-still-popular games like <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> at "High" settings and a full 1440p resolution.</p>
<p>Factor in a few more generations of graphics card upgrades—not to mention <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/dlss-fsr-microsoft-aims-to-end-the-pc-gaming-upscaling-wars-with-directsr/">frame-generation technology</a> that <a href="https://blurbusters.com/frame-generation-essentials-interpolation-extrapolation-and-reprojection/">could offer 10 reprojected frames for every key frame</a>—and waiting a single millisecond for your monitor to show a new image might not be totally ridiculous. With the way things are going, we're already awaiting the day, years from now, when we look back on an article like this and find it quaint that we were ever impressed by the idea of a display that topped out at a mere 1,000 Hz.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has reportedly already greenlit Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 developer Ninja Theory's next project and has "no plans whatsoever" to close the studio - news that comes amid fan concerns for its future following the closure of Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.
</p>
<p>
The relative lack of promotion for Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 in the run up to tomorrow's launch had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-2-is-only-two-weeks-away-and-fans-feel-xbox-should-be-making-more-noise">some Ninja Theory fans worried</a> the game might ultimately slip under the radar, leading the studio to suffer the same fate as its Xbox bedfellows. Xbox's Aaron Greenberg previously attempted to allay fan fears by promising an imminent Hellblade 2 "global paid media campaign", and a new report from Windows Central also suggests concern is unwarranted.
</p>
<p>
According <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch">to the publication</a>, which says its information comes from "trusted sources", Ninja Theory now has two projects in the works away from Hellblade 2. There's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hellblade-developer-ninja-theory-announces-project-mara">previously unveiled Project Mara</a> - described by the studio as a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror" - plus an unannounced game that's already been greenlit by Microsoft.

<p>
Windows Central doesn't offer any clues as to what this latter project might be, but it insists Microsoft has "no plans whatsoever to close the studio any time soon." This comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">Xbox's 1,900 layoffs in January</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">recent closures</a> of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games. Microsoft also recently merged Roundhouse Studios with The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios.
</p>
<p>

In a "thank you" message to fans <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264">shared</a> ahead of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 release tomorrow, Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews wrote, "From the very beginning of Senua's Sage: Hellbade 2, we have had you in-mind and I truly hope that when you play the second chapter of Senua's story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and that also so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too."
</p>
<p>
"Making video games is difficult," Matthews continued. "Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest: to make a game that sinks you deep into Senua's world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling. I believe we have achieved our quest and I hope you'll agree. I'm very proud of the game, very proud of our team, and very prod of you, our fans, who have supported us on this magical journey."
</p>
<p>
Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 arrives seven years after its acclaimed predeccessor. Last month, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5">Polygon reported</a> Ninja Theory veteran Tameem Antoniades, the game's director and writer, had departed the Cambridge-based studio, although it remains unclear why.

Everything you need to play the game comes in the box, including all cards, tokens, coins, and player figures, plus three six-sided dice and the rulebook. There is also a QR code you can scan to access a digital version of the rulebook.</p>                      </div><p dir="ltr">If you've never played Talisman before, it's an adventure board game with light RPG mechanics where up to six players compete to obtain the Crown of Command, slay the Elder Dragon and become the new ruler of the land. Each player chooses from one of 12 characters to play as, including the Thief, Elf, Wizard, and Prophetess. The original game launched back in 1983 and since then has seen multiple revisions, the last being the 4th edition in 2008. As mentioned, the 4th edition has been out of print for a while, and the game is expensive to grab from resellers. This new 5th edition printing will make picking up a copy of the game much easier--but considering it's an Avalon Hill game of a classic that many newer board game enthusiasts haven't had a chance to try, we wouldn't be surprised if the first wave of preorders sold out.</p><p dir="ltr">While you wait for your order to arrive, you could check out the officially licensed video game adaptation of Talisman.

                <p>The tactical sci-fi franchise, BattleTech, is turning 40 this year, and it's celebrating by launching a new edition of the original board game. Since its debut in 1984, the BattleTech franchise has branched out to video games, novels, TV, and more, but the series started as a tabletop board game dubbed BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-player-creates-their-own-mandalorian-experience-with-over-100-mods/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=starfield-player-creates-their-own-mandalorian-experience-with-over-100-mods<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="213" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Still mad at the cancellation of the rumored <em>Mandalorian</em> shooter? Then consider using all of your anger to follow the path of DeityVengy, a <em>Starfield </em>modder who more or less created his own <em>Mandalorian </em>experience.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">There are people who already love <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield</a></em> as is, and others who can at least see all the possibilities to make a great game that exist within. Some of those from the latter group are more dedicated than others, and hardly anyone will beat DeityVengy, a YouTuber and <em>Starfield</em> modding enthusiast who employed over one hundred mods to turn <em>Starfield</em> into the closest we can get to a video game adaptation of the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">On top of character skins, blasters, mobile empire units, Jetpacks, and revamped <em>Star Wars-</em>based menus, the most amazing part is that everything works beautifully well together. It really does look like you’re in one of the highest-budget episodes of the series.</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="I Turned Starfield Into the Ultimate Star Wars Game... 100+ Mods | Improvements | Raytracing" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nydaWXoidoo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">Even though DeityVengy is constantly trying to improve the experience and will probably never stop adding new mods as he finds them, they say the mods below constitute the core of this <em>Mandalorian</em> experience.</p> <ul data-found-items="13" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mandalorian Suit</a></li> <li data-index="1"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Aliens</a></li> <li data-index="2"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UC Empire</a></li> <li data-index="3"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7410">Freestar Rebels</a></li> <li data-index="4"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow Collective – Crimson Fleet Conversion</a></li> <li data-index="5"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6823" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Purge Troopers</a></li> <li data-index="6"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hugin’s Ecliptic Bounty Hunters</a></li> <li data-index="7"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8775" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Weapon Replacer (ALL)</a></li> <li data-index="8"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/6032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Aurebesh Conversion</a></li> <li data-index="9"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/5124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starfield HD Overhaul</a></li> <li data-index="10"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Boostpack to Jetpack</a></li> <li data-index="11"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/3211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unified Camera</a></li> <li data-index="12"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slightly Better Weapon Icons</a></li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">Whether you love or don’t care for Bethesda’s games, it’s hard to deny that they still push the envelope when it comes to fan creations — even when the company seems to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-on-pc-has-broken-mods-while-also-barely-fixing-anything/">accidentally thwart all modding efforts in other games. </a></p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">If none of this floats your spaceship, you can play normal <em>Starfield </em>on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and watch <em>The Mandalorian</em> on Disney +.</p>

<p data-characters="230" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When you finally <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-kuva-sobek-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get your Kuva Sobek</a> in <em>Warframe</em>, you will want to use the best mods for the best build. Don’t worry, we got you covered. If you want to go all out with this amazing shotgun, check out what we have cooking below.</p> <h2 id="h-best-kuva-sobek-build-in-warframe" data-injectable="false">Best Kuva Sobek build in <em>Warframe</em></h2> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">This is going to be a very end-game-friendly build that’s great for general use. It has a stronger emphasis on mobbing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-acid-shells-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to the Acid Shells mod.</a> So, here’s the setup:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true"> <li>Galvanized Hell</li> <li>Galvanized Savvy</li> <li>Primed Ravage</li> <li>Toxic Barrage</li> <li>Frigid Blast</li> <li>Acid Shells</li> <li>Critical Deceleration</li> <li>Hunter Munitions</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="26" data-current-count="26" data-injectable="false"><strong>Exilus: </strong>Vigilante Supplies</p> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="90" data-injectable="false"><strong>Arcane:</strong> Primary Merciless, Primary Deadhead, or Shotgun Vendetta</p> <p data-characters="24" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false"><strong>Progenitor Element: </strong>Fire</p> <figure data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">With this build, you’re going to be doing <strong>heavy critical hits with heat and viral damage often. </strong>It’s great against armor and health. Also, once you start getting kills with this, nearby enemies will be inflicted with Corrosive, giving you bonus damage with the Galvanized Savvy mod.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Pair all that with Hunter Munitions and now you have something that chews through health and armor with ease. Bonus points if you use Warframes that have <strong>grouping abilities like Nidus with his Larva</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">It’s important that your Progenitor element is fire so that you get to just put in the Viral elemental combination in any order. Just as long as you have cold and toxin together, you can get that combination.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">Also, there’s wiggle room with the Arcane Enhancements since this weapon is quite versatile. The projectile spread on this gun is very tight, making it a prime candidate for headshots. However, if you aren’t too good at hitting enemy heads, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-shotgun-vendetta-arcane-in-warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just opt for the Shotgun Vendetta</a> or Primary Merciless options.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="114" data-current-count="114" data-injectable="false">To get the <strong>Fire element</strong> on the shotgun, these are the frames that give the element upon starting the Lich process:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="false"> <li>Chroma</li> <li>Ember</li> <li>Inaros</li> <li>Kullervo</li> <li>Nezha</li> <li>Protea</li> <li>Vauban</li> <li>Wisp</li> </ul>

I think if Zelnick and Take-Two believe <em>GTA 6</em> can succeed at $80 they’ll charge that and sell you a special edition for even more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-buying-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Wingspan has quickly ascended in recent years to become one of the most popular board games. Not only has the delightful card-based engine builder made a home in the collections of more serious hobbyists, but Wingspan has also been found nesting in the board game aisles of major retailers like Target and Walmart. Wingspan isn’t just a financial success either; it’s also a critical darling. The base package is the recipient of numerous Game of the Year awards and is widely considered one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><u>best board games</u></a> on the market. </p><p>For those who have yet to play a round of Wingspan, it might seem odd that a board game essentially centered around the somewhat niche hobby of birdwatching has captivated millions of players. Simply upon opening the box, however, it’s apparent how much love and attention has been paid to its construction. The passion of first-time game designer Elizabeth Hargrave is soaked into every component, from the hand-painted cards to the moss-covered dice tray designed to look like a bird feeder. Not to mention, but most importantly, the act of playing is simply fun. It’s perhaps cliché to refer to a board game as an accessible title that is difficult to master, but Wingspan perfectly embodies the sentiment with its mostly straightforward ruleset and wealth of advanced strategies.</p><p>Soaring sales numbers and a laundry list of accolades have led to several expansions and various iterations, adding more and more tabletop enthusiasts to the list of budding ornithologists. Wingspan’s expansions build upon existing strategies by adding even more birds from around the world with new mechanisms and abilities, but before exploring new habitats, players should first set their sights on the base game.</p><h2>The Base Game</h2><h3>Wingspan</h3><div id="155272"><p><h3>Wingspan</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65.00</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 1-5</li><li>Play Time: 40-70 mins</li></ul><p>The Wingspan base game was released in 2019, and it remains a fantastic experience for solo playthroughs as well as get-togethers with friends and family. As noted in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wingspan-board-game-review"><u>Wingspan review</u></a>, the box is stuffed with unique components such as hand-painted cards, a bird feeder-style dice tray, and pastel-colored eggs, as well as themed tokens, dice, and player boards. Everything needed for hours of single and multiplayer fun is included in this beautifully constructed package. The base game is also required for several of the expansions, making this an ideal starting point. Many of the birds included in this iteration of Wingspan are based on Hargrave’s real-life observations in Maryland, but the various expansions add species from around the globe.</p><h2>The Expansions</h2><h3>Wingspan: European Expansion</h3><div id="200848"><p><h3>Wingspan European Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $30.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>90 cards (81 new bird cards, 5 bonus cards, 4 Automa cards)</li><li>New colorful scorecard for single and multiplayer scoring</li><li>15 purple egg miniatures</li><li>38 added food tokens</li><li>Custom storage tray</li><li>5 goal tiles and 1 reference tile</li><li>Rulebook</li></ul><p>As you might have already guessed, the European Expansion adds birds from the continent of Europe to the Wingspan series. The 81 new bird cards are designed to shuffle directly into the original deck present in the Wingspan base game. The appeal isn’t simply just adding beautiful new cards to the deck, however. The birds within the European Expansion introduce new abilities to the game, many of which are designed to increase player interaction. To house and accommodate the stunning new components, the expansion also includes a new custom tray, extra food tokens, additional egg miniatures, and a colorful new scorecard.</p><p>While the European Expansion is the first add-on to be released, it isn’t necessarily recommended as the next package to pick up after Wingspan. It is certainly a worthwhile addition, but it doesn’t add as much new content or mechanics to the experience as more recent expansions. Completionists and those simply looking to add more bird cards to their decks certainly won’t be disappointed by the European Expansion, but due to the sheer amount of new game-changing content in subsequent releases, it might be wise to revisit this update after incorporating either the Oceania Expansion or Wingspan Asia… or both.</p><h3>Wingspan: Oceania Expansion</h3><div id="200849"><p><h3>Wingspan Oceania Expansion</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $35.00 USD</p><p>Components (REQUIRES BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>107 cards (95 new bird cards, 5 bonus cards, 7 Automa cards)</li><li>69 nectar tokens (a new food type introduced in the expansion)</li><li>15 yellow egg miniatures</li><li>5 new player mats and 5 new dice</li><li>4 goal tiles and 1 reference tile</li><li>Rulebooks and scorepad</li></ul><p>The Oceania Expansion, Wingspan’s second add-on, primarily introduces new birds from Australia and New Zealand. Like the European Expansion, the Oceania cards are designed to shuffle right into the deck of the base game. Unlike the European Expansion, however, Oceania introduces a new food source and board to Wingspan that significantly changes the gameplay. Nectar, the aforementioned new food source, is unique as it serves as a sort of wild card that can be played in place of other food types. Another added twist is that unused nectar tokens are returned to the supply at the end of each round.</p><p>The Oceania Expansion also includes a new game board that not only incorporates nectar but also alters bonuses and requirements for playing cards in certain areas, resulting in even more eventful turns and a change to traditional strategy. These components, along with the new dice, essentially replace the original pieces in the base game when abiding by the expansion’s rules. Largely due to these gameplay updates, it is recommended to pick up the Oceania Expansion before the European Expansion as the cards in the latter will fold right into the deck and updated mechanics. That being said, there is still one additional expansion to check out.</p><h3>Wingspan Asia</h3><div id="200850"><p><h3>Wingspan Asia</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $45.00 USD</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 10+</li><li>Players: 1-2 standalone or 6-7 when combined with base game</li><li>Play Time: 40-70 mins</li></ul><p>Components (DOES NOT REQUIRE BASE GAME)</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>122 cards (90 new bird cards, 14 bonus cards, 18 Automa cards)</li><li>A Deut game board for 2-player mode</li><li>A turn-order dial for Flock mode which allows for 6-7 players</li><li>2 double-sided player mats for standard and Oceania rules</li><li>81 food tokens, 5 dice, and a birdfeeder board</li><li>An appendix, scorecard, and rulebooks for multiplayer and Automa play</li><li>Components for Duet and Flock modes such as tokens, goal tiles, swift-start guides</li></ul><p>Wingspan Asia sets itself apart from the Oceania and European Expansions by serving as both an expansion and a standalone experience. The two-player Duet mode does not require the base game. It also plays a little bit differently than two-player Wingspan, adding a new map with bonus objectives to track throughout the game. Of course, like the other expansions, this Duet mode along with the additional bird cards can be tacked onto the base game, shuffling right into the core entry. As Duet mode adds a bit of unique strategy without further complicating the rules, it's a welcome wrinkle for two-player games for those who are already enjoying Wingspan.</p><p>Flock mode, on the other hand, can get a bit messy and does require the base game. Without diving too deep into the rulebook, Flock mode basically makes it so two games of Wingspan are occurring at once. Honestly, it’s not the ideal way to experience the series, but that doesn’t mean Winspan Asia isn’t worth buying.</p><p>The Duet mode and new cards introduced in Wingspan Asia are well worth the investment by themselves. Not to mention, for those looking to solely experience Wingspan as a one or two-person game, there is an argument that this is an ideal starting point. That said, most will still likely want to start with the base game as it has the ability to play up to five. If you can manage to wrangle in more players, Wingspan is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players"><u>best four-player board games</u></a>, and it also plays exceptionally well at three players. As an expansion, the decision between Oceania and Asia depends on what you’re looking for and how much you’re willing to spend. Players who want the ultimate two-player experience and a standalone version may want to check out Wingspan Asia first, while other players looking to enhance the original game will likely want to plot a course directly toward the Oceania Expansion.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Wyrmspan</h3><div id="199023"><p><h3>Wyrmspan</h3></p></div><p><strong>MSRP</strong>: $65</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age: 14+</li><li>Players: 1-5</li><li>Play Time: 90 mins</li></ul><p>If birds still aren’t your thing, Wyrmspan offers many of the same mechanics as Wingspan, but with dragons instead. Those familiar with Wingspan will quickly catch onto Wyrmspan, but that’s not to say it's simply a fantasy-themed reskin. For example, the introduction of the Dragon Guild card serves as an entirely unique idea that offers players who trigger the mechanic various bonuses. It’s a simple yet rewarding tweak that packs even more fun into turns without adding too many complicated rules to the core gameplay inspired by Wingspan.</p><p>Wyrmspan is a standalone game not at all compatible with Wingspan. That said, many of the components that make the original title great are also present here. Like Wingspan, Wyrmspan features incredible artwork, beautiful components, accessible rules, and deep strategy. Games run slightly longer than its predecessor and the added mechanics ever-so-slightly steepen the learning curve, but those interested in dragons—pretty much everyone, I assume—are encouraged to check out Wyrmspan. Read our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wyrmspan-board-game-review">Wyrmspan review</a> for more information.</p><h3>Wingspan: Digital Edition</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dMld6" target="_blank">Get it for PC</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/MVgv0" target="_blank">Get it for Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/gld30" target="_blank">Get it for Xbox</a></li></ul><p>Digital versions of Wingspan as well as its Oceania and European Expansions are available on PC, Switch, and Xbox. On PC and console, the base game retails for $19.99 USD, while the Oceana and European Expansions go for $11.99 and $9.99 respectively. There are also mobile versions of Wingspan available on iOS and Android for $9.99 USD, with the European Expansion offered as an in-app purchase for an additional $9.99.</p><p>Additionally, Wingspan is available to play on Board Game Arena with a Premium Membership. For those unfamiliar with the site, Board Game Arena is a massive platform for playing board games online. While Board Game Arena does offer many titles for free, games like Wingspan are only accessible at the Premium tier. At just $3.00 per month (billed at $36.00 yearly), it’s a relatively inexpensive way to play hundreds of board games right from your computer. Of course, digital versions miss out on some of the social aspects of board games like Wingspan, but they’re great options for those who want to save a little bit of money and for nights when it’s difficult to get people together.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Wingspan is a fantastic game for any collection. The various expansions each offer something unique, along with a ton of beautifully illustrated bird cards. For those who simply cannot get into the bird-watching theme, Wyrmspan offers a similarly fun time, but with dragons. Luckily, many of these titles can be purchased well under MSRP, especially the base version of Wingspan which can often be found on sale at various retailers like Target, Walmart, and Amazon, as well as your local board game shop.

Chapter 10 left fans hungry for more pages, as the monthly manga showcased the two daughters channeling the aesthetics of their fathers. Clear some room on your calendars, here’s when we can expect <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11 to release.</p> <h2 id="0-boruto-two-blue-vortex-chapter-11-release-date-and-time" data-injectable="false"><em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11 release date and time</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> follows a monthly release schedule with a generous amount of content with each chapter. Currently, <em>Boruto: TBV</em> Chapter 11 is scheduled to be released on <strong>Thursday, June 20, 2024 at 11 a.m. ET (8 a.m. PT).</strong>&nbsp;</p> <div id="ub_countdown_3f1e8031-f526-436b-8f77-5381e8b2d438" data-expirymessage="Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter 11 is live." data-enddate="1718895600" data-largestunit="week" data-smallestunit="second" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><p><span>Weeks</span><span></span><span>Days</span><span></span><span>Hours</span><span></span><span>Minutes</span><span></span><span>Seconds</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p><p><span>:</span></p></div> <h2 id="1-where-to-read-boruto-two-blue-vortex-chapter-11" data-injectable="false">Where to read <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11</h2> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Boruto: TBV</em> is free to read on the Viz Media website, the Shonen Jump app, and the MangaPlus app. Each source offers simultaneous releases for <em>Boruto: TBV</em> which means that fans from across the globe receive access to the latest chapters at the same time.</p>
 <p id="ub-styled-box-notification-content-baac9447-bc02-456f-b65f-28aed477d712">This next section will contain<strong> spoilers from Chapter 10</strong>, so if you aren’t caught up with the <a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/viewer/1021108">latest manga chapter</a>, you might want to come back after you’ve done so.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect in <em>Boruto: Two Blue Vortex</em> Chapter 11</h2> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">In Chapter 10, Himawari is safely flown away from the pursuing Shinjus by the coordinated efforts of Team 10. Jura wastes no time and chooses to pursue Himawari, leaving Hidari to handle the jonins led by Konohamaru. Unfortunately for us Konohamaru fans, Sarada arrives and captures Hidari’s attention before the Team 7 leader can get in on the action.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="573" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true">Without wasting any time, Hidari attempts a sneak attack on Sarada with her father’s signature jutsu: The Chidori. Thanks to her three-tomoe Sharingan, Sarada can see through the move and counter with a Chidori of her own. After remarking that the jutsu is a move used by her and her father, it seems that Sarada is on track to learn more about Hidari and his connection to Sasuke Uchiha in Chapter 11. We have yet to see what the unique powers of her Mangekyou Sharingan are. But three years after its reveal, it’s likely we’ll see it in action against Hidari.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">The most anticipated moment of Chapter 10 was the conversation between Kurama (It’s really him!) and Himawari. It’s finally confirmed that the nine-tailed fox within Himawari is a resurrection of Kurama, whose chakra was passed onto her through Naruto. Unlike the grumpy adult Kurama who took years to warm up to Naruto, the young fox seems more patient and like a mentor to Himawari from the very beginning. He even remarks that Himawari’s affinity with his chakra is greater than Naruto’s.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via MangaPlus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">As expected from the daughter of Naruto, Himawari impulsively attacks Jura and gets herself&nbsp;trapped in a divine tree. After seeing her beloved friend being impaled while attempting to save her, a nostalgic figure rises from the destroyed divine tree. Chapter 10 leaves us with a panel of Himawari baring her canine teeth and distinctive fox features; a spitting image of her father. Based on the flowing of her hair, she’s not going to start with a few tails awakened –&nbsp; but all nine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">The events of <em>Boruto: TBV</em> Chapter 11 are shaping up to be the daughters of Naruto and Sasuke showing everybody that the last names aren’t the only things they inherited. With Sarada and Himawari locked in combat with the mysterious Shinjus, we can expect to see the girls carry the series for the next few chapters.&nbsp;</p>

Greeting the poor employee in the morning right when the store opened, Steinfeld turned over a bunch of cards, including a Miriam trainer and a full art Squirtle from the base <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> set, to see how they were appraised and what he could get for them.</p><p>“These are cool,” the employee, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhRdiBeDxc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfhRdiBeDxc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who Steinfeld recorded</a></span>, says while thumbing through the PSA graded cards in their acrylic cases. “So how does this whole grading thing work?” (The GameStop employee later told <em>Kotaku</em> he didn’t feel ambushed and was happy to learn on the spot but also didn’t know Steinfeld was filming him.)</p><p>GameStop announced the trade-in program earlier this month and began rolling it out immediately without taking the time to do much training. While scanning codes on the graded cases pulls up what the card should look like and the amounts the store can offer, it’s up to employees to go through an eleven-point checklist to make sure the cards aren’t fraudulent.</p><p>The GameStop employee in the video understandably ends up having to call a supervisor to walk him through the training in real time while also dealing with other customers that come into the store to buy actual games. He looks at the cards, holds them up to the light, and tries to check for any signs of tampering, but like it would be for you or I or anyone else that’s not trained in detecting fake, phony, or counterfeit PSA-graded collectibles, the process looks purely vibes-based.</p><p>Steinfeld estimated the value of the cards he was trading in ahead of time based on recent eBay listings, and the actual amounts GameStop paid him for them were all over the place, from pretty good to pretty terrible. Overall, he got $157 for cards worth an estimated $328, pretty close to 50 percent of the estimated value.</p><p>That might not sound like much considering how easy it is to sell a handful of cards online, but consider this: it’s way more than you’d get for trading in your actual games. GameStop will currently only give you $20 cash for <em>Stellar Blade</em>, which is $70 new on PlayStation 5 and came out less than a month ago. Then again, games are commodities, and PSA-graded cards are, by definition, collectibles. It’s hard to imagine who is selling their rare Lugia to GameStop rather than to another collector on Facebook or eBay.</p><p>Then again, Steinfeld seemingly made out better than some of his own fans did when buying his own Pokémon mystery boxes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/pgbkkz/psa_dont_buy_leonharts_box_its_trash_it_came_with/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/pgbkkz/psa_dont_buy_leonharts_box_its_trash_it_came_with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some buyers of his giveaways</a></span> reported getting less than a third of the value of what they paid for them. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="425" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The backdrop of the <em>Mad Max</em> series is probably more beautiful than a noxious wasteland has any right to be, but it’s still less interesting than the characters populating it. Even though they don’t tend to speak much, the ensemble driving both the vehicles and the plot of the series is responsible for some of the best worldbuilding in the history of cinema. Let’s honor the maddest of the bunch, shall we?</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nu-Max (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="721" data-current-count="1021" data-injectable="true">Even though the series’ very title alludes to his supposed madness, the original Max Rockatansky was never really that mad — especially for a guy who witnessed his family getting run over right before the Apocalypse took place. The new Max, the one that we see in <em>Fury Road,</em> however, seems to have finally completed his transformation into someone who deserves that title. Max states in the trailer that has been reduced to his survival instinct, and it shows. Max barely even talks, and is constantly haunted by people he’s supposedly failed, but the people we see haunting him are not his family. Is this guy even the Max from the original films? There’s no way of knowing, and that’s awesome.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Mad Max 2 - Feral Kid - Boomerang" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RAHOMuiipsE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Feral Kid (The Road Warrior)</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Though he looks harmless, the Feral Kid is as lethal as a post-apocalyptic reimagining of Kevin McCallister. If nothing else, the kid taught many adults not to knock on Australia’s most famous weapon as he can maim or even kill you with a throw of his boomerang.</p>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">The Feral Kid is such an enigma that many fans believed that the Max that we see in <em>Fury Road</em> is actually a grown-up version of this boomerang master. Fun theory, though it’s one that director George Miller <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/fury-road-director-responds-to-the-mad-max-conspiracy-theory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately shot down.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mad Max - Bubba &amp; Toecutter Wasted [HD]" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QU1BnGKoXh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Toecutter (Mad Max)</h2> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">The leader of the biking gang in the original <em>Mad Max</em> isn’t even its nastiest member — you don’t see him cutting off one single toe throughout the entire film, but he has one of the most iconic death scenes in the history of cinema. You can assume this guy is going to get what’s coming to him in a horrifying car crash, but you never expect him to look straight into the camera and have his eyes nearly pop out of their sockets for a final shocked look before his demise.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="You will know the vengeance of Lord Humungus!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6x2C4LMBGI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Lord Humungus (The Road Warrior)</h2> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">Toecutter is imposing because he leads a group of mad men, but Lord Humungus would be imposing on his own — though he too leads an army of even-madder men.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">This is a massive jacked-up beast with a flair for the theatrical who can — and will — crush his enemies with ease. He seems to be impervious to cold, or simply does not believe in the effect clothing has against it as he’s never seen wearing more than his muscles and a mask.</p> <figure data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mad Max: Fury Road - Let There Be Water" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d605rM0U3x0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Immortan Joe (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false">George Miller knew he’d found the perfect actor to play a villain in the <em>Mad Max</em> world in Hugh Keays-Byrne, the man who played Toecutter in the original film, so he just brought him back to play a new villain in <em>Fury Road.</em> Immortan Joe is older, but makes great use of his ghostly transparent armor and teeth-filled mask to look as imposing as you can.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">His greatest moment is when he tells his people not to get addicted to water, the perfect quote to leave the audience wondering if they’re witnessing a cruel mind at work, or a yet another completely delusional man.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Stuck in the Mud Blue Scene - Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) - Movie Clip HD Scene" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CtZSqc5LdY0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Bullet Farmer (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">This is probably the maddest character of the bunch, an absolute bloodthirsty fool who happily dual wields SMGs into battle even though he’d just sustained an injury that rendered him completely blind. The logic behind his action seems to be that if you have enough bullets, you’re eventually going to end up hitting your target. </p>
 <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="119" data-injectable="false">He doesn’t, but his attempt makes for a beautifully operatic scene that no one expected to come out of such film.</p> <figure data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Aunty Entity (Beyond Thunderdome)</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">Tina Turner’s character in <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em> is a surprising villain for the post-apocalyptic genre. Instead of having always been evil, or having gone mad with the end of the world like so many in this universe, she’s just the result of corruption. She was a good person not too long before the events of the movie, and built her new civilization out of good will, but ended up becoming a bloodthirsty tyrant like so many others would become in her position.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by WB</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The War Boys (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="559" data-current-count="859" data-injectable="true">I’m not mentioning any specific war boy because I see them as a hivemind, a legion of absolute maniacs who answer only to Immortan Joe. The War Boys quickly became one of the most iconic parts of <em>Fury Road</em>, as they immediately turned simple expressions such as “Mediocre!” and “Witness me!” into instant classics. They’re absolute mad men who strive to spend the entirety of their lives high on adrenaline, chrome spray and even on blood transfusions. They also worship a god who happens to be a huge engine, but of course.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-crow-fishers-fury-road" data-injectable="false">The Crow Fishers (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="762" data-injectable="true">The Crow Fishers display George Miller’s nearly <em>Souls</em>-y worldbuilding at its best. Though they look a tad scary, they’re not goons put there for a filler action sequence. They completely ignore the main characters because they’re doing their own thing. We don’t learn exactly what it is that they do or why they only show up at night balancing themselves on long stilts, but their tortured existence somehow never feels off in this world.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Doof Warrior (Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="false">The Doof Warrior, also known as Coma-Doof Warrior, is easily the most visually and audibly striking character of <em>Fury Road.</em> The Doof Warrior is a blind and faceless man who owns a huge car that serves only as an amp for him to use his guitar skills to hype up Immortan Joe’s army. We don’t learn anything about him from the movie, but George Miller has since revealed that the mask he wears throughout most of the film is actually <a href="https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Coma-Doof_Warrior" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the face of his mother</a>. Some things are best left enshrouded in mystery!</p>

<p data-characters="200" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Indeed, the Titan of Time may be the enemy in <em>Hades 2</em>, but that doesn’t mean all of time is against you. Knowing how the passing of Time works in <em>Hades 2</em> is key in your struggle against Chronos.</p> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">Time in <em>Hades 2</em> gives you a good idea of how long certain in-game activities can take, but it doesn’t pass by any traditional means. <strong>In <em>Hades 2</em>, time moves via a unit of measurement called “While,” which moves in several ways</strong>.</p> <h2 id="h-while-and-how-the-passing-of-time-works-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">While, and how the passing of Time works in <em>Hades 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">That passing time, or While, is shown as a small clock symbol next to a number in <em>Hades 2</em>. The number represents how many While(s) need to tick by before that activity is done. So, <strong>if you’re cooking up an Alchemy recipe that takes 8 While to finish, you’ll need to do something to make that number tick down eight times</strong>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Planting seeds in <em>Hades 2</em> is a common activity that requires time to pass, but it’s not the only one. Here are all the activities that need time to complete:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-plant-guide-every-seed-and-where-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Growing plants</a></li> <li>Using Alchemy <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-hades-2-incantations-and-their-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Cauldron</a></li> <li>Ordering Charon rewards</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">There are ways to pass time while playing <em>Hades 2</em>. The first method is to, well, <em>play Hades 2</em>. <strong>Each Location (or room) you clear in a Region counts as the passing of 1 While</strong>. Since there can be around 14 Locations in a typical Region, something that takes 8 While should be done long before you face the Guardian. </p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true">Some things do take much longer. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-do-charon-gold-rewards-cards-work-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spending Obol Points</a> to order 80 Psyche from Charon takes 40 While, for example. Finishing an entire run of the game should get you there, though.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true"><strong>The second way to pass While in <em>Hades 2</em> is by spending time with companions</strong>. After you unlock communal areas in the Crossroads, you can invite friends and acquaintances to hang out for a bit. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-the-hot-springs-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first area you will likely unlock is the Hot Springs</a>, which you can use so long as you have some Bath Salts and someone willing to casually strip down and chat. </p>
 <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="70" data-injectable="false">There are three hangouts in the Crossroads at which you can pass time:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="190" data-injectable="false"> <li>Hot Springs</li> <li>Taverna</li> <li>Fishing Pier</li> </ul> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">Using these areas spends some While. The amount of which is shown in details area of the items you need to invite someone (while in your inventory):</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Bath Salts </strong>– Hot Springs <ul> <li>Passes 12 While</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Twin Lures</strong> – Fishing Pier <ul> <li>Passes 16 While</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Ambrosia </strong>– Taverna <ul> <li>Passes 20 While</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="759" data-injectable="false">If you’re waiting on some sweet Fate Fabric from your boy Charon and you have a bottle of Ambrosia you’ve been saving for the right person, taking a trip to the Taverna can help you get your goods to you faster. I’d even suggest planting seeds when you have a colleague in dire need of a soak in the Hot Springs and then inviting them to chill while your Thalamus happily grows into an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-thalamus-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unnerving, pinkish-white brain fungus</a>. What a good day.</p>

            <p>
Paradox Interactive has delayed Life By You - the new Sims-like from its Paradox Tectonic studio - yet again  saying "additional development time is needed" and that it doesn't want to commit to a new release date it "cannot be certain to meet".
</p>
<p>
This marks the third delay for Life By You, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">announced last March</a> amid promises of a fully open-world with no loading screens, "real language conversation", digital humans that could optionally be directly controlled by players, and plenty of customisation.
</p>
<p>
It initially also featured a rather bland art style that immediately drew criticism, leading to the game's first delay. Rather than release into PC early access last September, as had originally been the plan, Paradox announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-life-by-you-early-access-release-delayed-into-next-year">delaying Life by You into March this year</a> so it could spruce up its visuals, its UI, and other elements.

<p>
In February, however, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-sims-like-life-by-you-has-been-delayed-again-and-is-now-aiming-for-june">announced a second delay</a>, this time to 4th June, to "ensure that it's as smooth and fun... as possible, and lays a strong foundation for building out [the game] during early access." But with just two weeks to go until launch, Paradox has now confirmed the game won't be making that release date either.
</p>
<p>
"After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s early access release date, previously set for June 4th," the publisher <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">wrote in its latest announcement</a>. "This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed."
</p>
<p>
"While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window," Paradox continued, "we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet."
</p>
<p>
Life By You's succession of delays comes amid a seemingly turbulent time for Paradox. Earlier this year, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-gets-a-3d-sequel-in-march">announced</a> then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-release-date-delayed-again-less-than-a-month-from-launch">twice delayed</a> a Prison Architect sequel, more recently confirming it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parted ways with its developer</a> ahead of release. That news followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">troubled development</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, and the disastrously premature launch of Cities: Skylines 2, which was recently forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">halt all DLC plans</a> while its developer worked on addressing the "shortcomings of the game".
</p>
<p>
While Paradox has elected not to give Life by You a new release date following its most recent delay, the publisher says it'll share more "as soon as possible".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-launch-trailer-ninja-theory-game-greenlit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> arrives tomorrow, and Microsoft and Ninja Theory have dropped one more stunning trailer that shows off the game’s impressive environments and facial animations. Don’t worry, there aren’t any spoilers, so check it out for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. Animal Soul by AURORA)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRbOmIcVXak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While launching a long-in-development title like Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II would usually be a celebratory moment, some Xbox fans are worried, as Microsoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down a number of mid-size first-party studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a> shortly after they had completed games. Thankfully, Microsoft insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jez Corden</a> has stepped in to provide a bit of reassurance, saying Ninja Theory’s next project has already been greenlit. Interestingly, Corden says the next thing is <em>not</em> Project Mara, a prototype Ninja Theory has teased in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Ninja Theory offers fans a message on the eve of Hellblade 2's launch.</p>
<p>Oh, and no, it's not a "goodbye" message like some are spinning. According to sources familiar, their next game has alr been greenlit.</p>
<p>READ: <a href="https://t.co/1VVGJHFMls">https://t.co/1VVGJHFMls</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NinjaTheory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NinjaTheory</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hellblade2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Hellblade2</a></p>
<p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1792634668287742113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Corden usually has the goods when it comes to Xbox-related stuff, so fingers crossed for the future. Meanwhile, Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews has posted <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601505083621573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this statement on the eve of Hellblade II’s release</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Hi Everyone, as we sit on the eve of the release of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II I wanted to thank you, our fans, on behalf of everyone here at Ninja Theory. We see you and we hear you when you give us such love and support, when you tell us how much Senua means to you, when you tell us how much you are looking forward to the game and how much faith you have in us to continue Senua’s story in a way that does justice to the connection so many of you have to her and to Hellblade.</em></p>
<p><em>From the very beginning of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II we have had you in-mind and I truly hope that when you play the 2nd chapter of Senua’s story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and that also so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too.</em></p>
<p><em>Making video games is difficult. Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest -- To make a game that sinks you deep into Senua’s world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling. I believe we have achieved our quest and I hope you’ll agree. I’m very proud of the game, very proud of our team and very proud of you, our fans, who have supported us on this magical journey.”</em></p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S tomorrow (May 21).</p>

        <p>The tech giant showcased its artificial intelligence feature within Minecraft</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Microsoft has revealed that its AI technology will be integrated into video games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-ai-will-be-inside-minecraft-and-other-xbox-pc-games-new-copilot-features-will-search-your-inventories-offer-tips-and-guides?s=31">As reported by Windows Central</a>, <a href="https://x.com/richontech/status/1792603950186959309">first spotted by KTLA tech reporter Rich DeMuro</a>, its Copilot program was implemented into Minecraft.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which took place during the Microsoft Surface and Windows AI event, showed off the feature as a user guide. It provided details on making an item within the game and advised the player what materials were needed.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Copilot program is an AI chatbot program that was developed and launched in 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wow-mop-remix-goat-farming-guide-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wow-mop-remix-goat-farming-guide-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Even though the Frog farming method in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> was recently nerfed, there is a new Goat farming method that while not as good, is pretty close. We’ve put together a <em>WoW MoP Remix</em> Goat Farming Guide to show you exactly how you can farm the bleating beasts for some quick experience, Bronze, and event-specific rewards.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-goat-farming-guide" data-injectable="false"><em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> Goat Farming Guide</h2> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">The best way to farm Bronze, experience, Lesser Charms, Scrolls, and other items exclusive to the <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> event is to farm Goats in the Valley of the Four Winds. As long as you have a full group clearing out the plateau of Goats, they will quickly respawn allowing you to mass farm the Goats in this area for a ton of rewards. Here is the best method and guide on how to successfully do the Goat Farm in <em>WoW Remix: MoP</em>:</p>
 <ol data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Log in to a Level 37+ <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> specific character. (Level 70 is recommended)</li> <li>Head to the plateau just west of The Heartland in Valley of the Four Winds.</li> <li>Check Group Finder for a group labeled ‘Goat Farm’ or start your own.</li> <li>Once in a group, fly up and down the plateau killing the groups of Goats as they spawn in.</li> <li>Loot them using AoE Loot to get all the Bronze, Scrolls, and Lesser Charms.</li> <li>Repeat! This is better in a group because it will constantly clear out the plateau quicker, forcing faster respawns.</li> </ol> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-farm-goats-in-wow-remix-mop" data-injectable="false">Where to farm Goats in <em>WoW Remix: MoP</em></h2> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, it’s easy to get to the right place to farm Goats in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em>. Simply head down to Valley of the Four Winds, then look for the big raised elevation plateau on the map in the western part of the zone. The plateau is just to the west of The Heartland, as you can see circled in red in the map above.</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="false">Up and down the entire plateau is where the Goats will continually spawn, so just fly up and down it farming the groups of Goats as they spawn!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-warframe-lander-abilities-ranked-from-worst-to-best/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-warframe-lander-abilities-ranked-from-worst-to-best<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="423" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The trusty <em>Warframe</em> lander, or landing craft, is an iconic part of the game. From last-minute rescues in story cutscenes to the dancing landers across the loading screen, these little ships get us where we need to go. If you activate an air support charge during a mission, you’ll get to use one of the special abilities that comes through unlocking the different landers, though can use it with any lander model you own.</p> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false">Sadly, some of these are more valuable than others, so we’re here today to rank the currently available lander air support abilities from worst to best.</p> <h2 id="h-7-carpet-bomb-scimitar" data-injectable="false"><strong>7.&nbsp;Carpet Bomb – Scimitar</strong></h2> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">This ability sends out a line of explosions that deal impact damage between the player and the air support charge. It’s fiddly to place and the damage is underwhelming against anything but the very weakest enemies. This was one of the earliest landing craft introduced, and it shows. It’s a shame, because visually-speaking it’s one of the best: it has a gorgeous manta ray design, but it’s also frustratingly hard to get parts for. Definitely not worth it right now, unless you’re a collector.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>6.&nbsp;Sentry Gun – Xiphos</strong></h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">A fixed turret is a great idea for an air support ability, but sadly this sentry gun very quickly falls behind in damage and durability, and will survive so little time that it’s barely worth getting out of the box. While you can buff its damage output with Roar, this lander is only worth getting if you like its aesthetics, and then you should definitely replace its ability.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>5.&nbsp;Dreamers – Nightwave</strong></h2> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">It breaks my heart to put this so low, because I love Nora Nightwave, but this lander is pretty middle of the road. With Dreamers, Nora unleashes a 10-meter-wide wave of sleep and deals a very small amount of damage. While this only lasts 20 seconds, you can target enemies with finishers in that time, but you would probably get more out of Rest &amp; Rage instead. This is one of my absolute favorite landers in terms of look, though.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Why yes, I did try to match my Mantis colour scheme to Poe Dameron’s X-Wing, why do you ask? Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>4. Med-Tower – Mantis</strong></h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The Med-Tower is the top of the middling options for me, as it provides a tower that sends out an area burst of healing and can be used 25 times. While the healing itself isn’t much, it can be useful in specific circumstances and provides an ongoing benefit. The Mantis is also a very pretty ship, so keep an eye out for the parts if you like its look.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>3.&nbsp;Override – Liset</strong></h2> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">The Liset is the starting lander, so it’s lucky that it also has the strongest ability of the older ships. Override stops alarms and lockdowns across the entire map instantly, and on top of that it pauses the countdowns on Rescue and Spy missions. It can be a real Hail Mary if you are bad at Spy and Rescue missions, as I am, but it does outlive its usefulness as you get better at the game.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>2. Kahl Beacon – Skaut</strong></h2> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">Who doesn’t love Kahl-175 and his underdog buddies? With the Skaut lander ability, you can bring them along for the ride! While they might only stick around for five minutes, bringing in support from this ragtag band is both fun and rewarding. You can augment them with Roar or Wisp’s reservoirs and they scale with the mission’s starting level. They’re generally a great bunch of lads.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>1. Orokin Eye – Parallax</strong></h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">At the top of the list, Orokin Eye removes the busywork from collectibles, statues and syndicate medallions, as it highlights certain rare resources within a 150-meter radius. Unlike the Golden Instinct Helminth ability, the markers from Orokin Eye persist until all players have interacted with them or they have been removed from the map. The only tragedies of this fantastic ability are that it doesn’t recharge fast enough and that it doesn’t highlight resource caches.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">An extra tip when using air support abilities is that you’ll want to level up the Engineering Intrinsic on your Railjack to level 2, which reduces the cooldown for your air support charges from 10 minutes to 5. Particularly important for endless missions!</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 developer Ninja Theory has reportedly already had its next game greenlit, which is in addition to Project Mara, which was first announced in 2020.</p>



<p>The report comes from Jez Corden at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a> and is seemingly in response to people misinterpreting the studio’s latest <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter post</a>, in which Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews thanks fans.</p>



<p>“Making video games is difficult. Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest: To make a game that sinks you deep into Senua’s world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling,” a part of the message read. </p>



<p>In a time of industry mass layoffs and uncertainty, it’s not difficult to see why some people came to the conclusion that the message felt like a goodbye. However, Corden reports that this is nothing more than a warm message from the studio head and that, according to their sources, their next game has been greenlit. Corden reiterates that the greenlit project is in addition to Project Mara, which was first announced in 2020.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s guess what the new game entails, but for now, we have Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 to look forward to, which releases on May 21, 2024, on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think Ninja Theory’s next project is? And are you looking forward to Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p>If you’re like us, you probably enjoy playing through a tough-as-nails game, sitting back for a minute or two, and then diving straight into a second playthrough. But it’s better when a game offers New Game Plus. With that said, does Black Myth: Wukong offer New Game Plus?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-have-new-game-plus">Will Black Myth: Wukong Have New Game Plus?</h2>



<p>Yes! The studio recently confirmed that, alongside boasting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-features-160-enemy-types-80-bosses-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a staggering number of unique enemies and bosses</a>, Black Myth: Wukong features New Game Plus at launch. You won’t have to wait for a content update sometime in the future to enjoy a second run with a more powerful Sun Wukong. </p>



<p>However, it’s unclear precisely what transfers over from your initial playthrough to a second playthrough. You’ll likely retain your skills and level if the game offers RPG-like progression, but as is common in most other New Game+ game modes, we’ll likely lose all equipment. But for now, we have to bide our time and patiently wait for additional word from the developers!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-myth-wukong-a-soulslike">Is Black Myth: Wukong a Soulslike?</h2>



<p>In many ways, Black Myth: Wukong is a Soulslike. However, the studio is on record saying it’s easier than your typical Soulsborne game. As such, we’ll likely find a far more accessible yet still challenging and rewarding gameplay experience. From the combat gameplay we’ve watched, it appears fast-paced, fluid, and complex, with various boss fight mechanics at play.</p>



<p>If you consider clearing enemies from a zone, then everything culminating in a challenging boss fight, then yeah, Black Myth: Wukong is Soulslike. I think it’ll have more in common with Elden Ring, which still offered brutal gameplay, especially with its many bosses, but felt more accessible overall.</p>

<p>Following its official launch out of Early Access, V Rising is taking the survival gaming world by storm. It’s an exceptional top-down action-RPG with castle-building, boss fights, and countless unique vampiric powers and lands to explore. But people on console deserve this experience, too. So, is V Rising cross platform?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-v-rising-have-cross-platform-support">Does V Rising Have Cross Platform Support?</h2>



<p>As developer Stunlock Studios only recently announced the game’s coming to PlayStation 5, they’ve unfortunately received little in the way of crossplay or cross-platform support for V Rising.</p>



<p>In fact, it’s likely not a priority whatsoever. Of course, that’s not to say it won’t happen. They’ll likely work behind the scenes to improve the console experience, tweaking balancing and controls to suit a controller and ultimately adding in highly-requested features—for instance, cross-platform support!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-v-rising-available-on">What Systems Is V Rising Available On?</h2>



<p>Currently, you can only play V Rising on PC. Specifically, it’s available on Steam. However, the studio recently unveiled the PlayStation 5 version in June but didn’t state whether the Xbox Series X|S will receive the game soon.</p>



<p>So, as to the question about V Rising on Xbox, it’s not happening…yet. Unless developer Stunlock Studios signed an exclusivity agreement with PlayStation, the Xbox port will likely happen eventually—perhaps by this Fall. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

It's also intended to be a multi-platform release across console, PC, and mobile.</p><p>Stellar Blade was released on April 26 for PS5. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/stellar-blade-review/2300-6463945/" data-ref-id="2300-6463945">Stellar Blade review</a>, we said, "I came away from Stellar Blade having enjoyed the game quite a bit despite its foibles on the back of its incredibly strong systems."</p>

            <p>
Geography of Robots - the developer behind 2022's acclaimed narrative adventure Norco - has revealed its new project, Silenus, and there's an "experimental" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">Steam demo</a> to try right now.
</p>
<p>
Silenus is described as a "micro-adventure" - lasting 2-2.5 hours - set on a Gulf Flow oil refinery recently acquired by Rubens Link, an "enigmatic company with an unclear agenda". Cast as an android called Titian, players must investigate the company's true motives - which seems to go beyond installing automation tech as it claims - by solving puzzles, deciphering clues, conversing with characters, and poking around the remains of vanished workers.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">newly released demo version of Silenus</a> is officially known as the Umbilical Pre-Release demo, and it's been created in collaboration with Baton Rouge doom metal band Thou to help promote its new album. "Thou composed material for our 2022 release Norco," Geography of Robots explains in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2927440/view/6009568738060250964?l=english">FAQ accompanying the demo</a>, "and we decided to extend this collaboration to help draw attention to their upcoming album release Umbilical."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A demo of our short adventure game Silenus is OUT NOW on Steam. Investigate a refinery operated by an obscure organization. Unlock all tracks from Thou's upcoming album Umbilical. This is a very small taste with more to come, so be sure to wishlist! 🔗 below. <a href="https://t.co/oyymxEXfWw">pic.twitter.com/oyymxEXfWw</a></p>— geographyofrobots (@roboticgeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1792555607175598587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
In the portion of Silenus available in the demo, players can unlock and listen to all the tracks from Umbilical, but the studio notes the game itself is "likely to change [a lot]" between now and release. "Many elements of the demo were designed with the Umbilical listening feature in mind," it explains. "These will likely be removed or reworked. Some narrative details will remain the same while others will change. However, the overall themes, aesthetics, and gameplay will be largely the same."
</p>
<p>
Silenus' demo is compatible with Mac, Steam Deck, and controllers but is only available for a limited time. Thou's album launches on 31st May, and Geography of Robots plans to keep the demo available "for 2 - 3 weeks following this release."
</p>
<p>
The developer say it hopes to complete the full version of Silenus "by the end of 2024". And if you've yet to experience the studio's previous project, Norco - which Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called a "beautiful, surprising, human, and utterly magnetic debut" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/norco-review">his Recommended review</a> - it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/">discounted by 60 percent</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="QdE6vB"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> has the kind of ending that sends people running to the internet looking for explainers and conversation — not because they didn’t understand it, exactly, but because they don’t necessarily believe what they just saw. Jane Schoenbrun’s follow-up to 2022’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a> is a dark movie: dark in the visuals, since so much of it takes place in queasy late-night spaces and dim, muddy interiors, and dark in the narrative specifics, which are not designed to comfort or coddle the viewers. This is not a feel-good film with a pat, heartwarming ending.</p>
<p id="WXJu9A">But it is a film that seems designed to get under viewers’ skins, and leave them examining their lives and their choices. Schoenbrun invites people to take any lingering discomfort that comes out of the end of the movie, and go do something with it. It’s a call to action, though what exactly “action” means is left wide open. Schoenbrun has a specific intention in mind, but the metaphor here is also broad enough that anyone watching this movie can wrap it tightly around their own lives and their own bodies until it fits for them.</p>

<p id="P1GVcB">The movie follows many years in the life of Owen (Ian Foreman in his younger years, Justice Smith thereafter), a hesitant, socially awkward kid who clearly struggles to relate to other people, at school and at home. When he meets hostile, disconnected Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), he manages a tentative connection with her by sharing her fandom for a late-night TV show about teenagers Isabel and Tara, who fight the world’s darkest, most evil forces with their powerful psychic connection. (The show, <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, was inspired in part by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer">Schoenbrun’s childhood obsession with <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="NVDj3w">Eventually, Maddy runs away from home and disappears without a trace, while Owen trudges from high school to early adulthood without shedding any of his adolescent awkwardness. Maddy returns eight years later to tell him she’s been inside the show — from her perspective, Owen and Maddy <em>are</em> Isabel and Tara in <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, but they were captured by their enemies and buried alive, their hearts cut out and stuffed in a refrigerator. </p>
<p id="74cb0h">Maddy says she escaped and rediscovered her true identity as Tara, but back in the real world, where time runs differently, Isabel is still buried, and the vision she’s been forced into — the false identity as Owen — will soon end when they both die. Maddy wants Owen to accept this, and go through the dangerous, deadly-sounding ritual she endured to wake herself up.</p>

<p id="4rldBS">For viewers, Maddy’s version of reality is likely to sound much more compelling than Owen’s. It’s a classic escapist fantasy: “This boring life we’re living isn’t real. We’re actually heroes from another world, with superpowers, and a mission to save the world.” But the route to get there is so dark and frightening — Maddy literally wants Owen to let her seal him in a coffin and bury him alive — that he rejects it and resists her. And that’s understandable, too. Maddy’s story could also be interpreted as a dangerous, paranoid delusion, and her solution sounds potentially fatal. Schoenbrun doesn’t pull punches about this particular call to adventure: There’s no clear evidence that Maddy isn’t unintentionally luring Owen into joint suicide. There’s no overt evidence that anything she’s saying is true.</p>
<p id="gukTwo">Schoenbrun has been clear about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">seeing all of this as a trans coming-out story</a>. Within the <em>Pink Opaque</em> narrative, Owen’s authentic self is female. He has periodic visions or dreams, quick flashes where he’s in the <em>Pink Opaque</em> setting as himself, but wearing Isabel’s dress. Maddy wants to take him on a journey to find his real body and his true identity as Isabel, but the path to get there will be painful and take real commitment.</p>
<p id="M3Ffwk">Owen recoils from it, refuses to accept Maddy’s revelations, and chooses to stay in his old life. Even though the <em>Pink Opaque </em>narrative haunts him, he takes the passive route, muddling through his existing life and claiming that it’s gratifying, that he’s found peace, family, and contentment there.</p>
<p id="17U07Q">Ahead of the movie’s wide release, Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">talked to Polygon about that kind of passivity</a>, and about feeling it’s a familiar part of the trans experience:</p>
<blockquote><p id="2hPfen">I think that kind of “passivity” feels inherently tied to an experience that I — and I think many other trans folks — can relate to on a deeply visceral level. It indicates exactly how our ideas about what proper narrative or progress is is not only woefully limited in the experiences it’s showing, but also like maybe by definition, masculine and cis. [It’s] reflective of an idea of agency and individual agency that doesn’t resonate with other experiences, like my own. And so I am trying to rewrite or call into question or challenge or simply just like, exist within alternative ideas of narrative structure, to express something that feels emotionally truthful to my experience in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p id="reStUX">Schoenbrun clearly feels sympathy for Owen’s dilemma, and for his uncertainty about redefining himself as someone else. At the same time, though, the director repeatedly suggests that Owen is lying to himself. While he defends himself to the audience by saying he built a family of his own and that he loves them, we never see them or hear any details about them. They never seem real, and even their existence might be a hallucination or an outright lie. As Owen continues to reject Maddy’s version of the truth, years blur by for him, with no sense of grounding or connection in the reality he’s chosen.</p>

</p>
<p id="PlvtXr">Toward the end of the movie, he’s clearly stuck in an unsatisfying place in life, surrounded by unpleasant people and working at an unfulfilling job. In two of the movie’s most vividly painful moments, he screams that he’s dying and he pleads for help, but no one around him hears him or sees his distress. Then he cuts his own chest open, and sees the staticky glow of the TV screen inside. As Schoenbrun <a href="https://ew.com/i-saw-the-tv-glow-director-jane-schoenbrun-explains-ending-justice-smith-brigette-lundy-paine-8643442">explained it to Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="hgRVEB">After half a lifetime of resistance, when Owen finally sees that glow inside himself — and to do so, he literally has to open himself up and see the heart that’s been taken from him, and see that it’s been replaced by this signal that could be something beautiful, but also carries the ambivalence and sinister nature of the emptiness of glow; the thing that it is representing what isn’t there inside him. This was my attempt to capture the ambivalence and overwhelming joy and possibility, but also things that feel sinister and terrifying about an egg crack — the moment when, as a queer or trans person, you understand that you aren’t yourself and that you need to become something else to conjure that magic that was maybe there in childhood and maybe there in these other moments in life.</p></blockquote>
<p id="2aj3SK">Even faced with this visible, obvious sign that his chosen mundane reality has cracks in it, though, Owen still doesn’t take that next step. He closes up his chest and goes back to his work in a shrill, dark, oppressive arcade — and he humbly apologizes to everyone he encounters, embarrassed about that outburst that no one else saw, remembers, or cares about.</p>
<p id="OLaMCA">It’s a horrifying sequence: He’s living out a series of intense private agonies and doubts, and instead of giving those doubts space, he’s muffling them for the sake of all the utterly indifferent people around him. Instead of examining the source of his terror and trying to find a solution, he begs for forgiveness from absolute strangers, out of anxiety that his impending death might have impinged on their fun. It’s hard to say which is more horrifying: his humility and humiliation, or everyone else’s apathy and inability to even see his pain. </p>

</p>
<p id="xNccXd">It’s a dark, sad ending — there is no rescue coming for Owen, no sudden breakthrough where Maddy saves him in spite of himself, or where the world of <em>The Pink Opaque </em>sends him even clearer proof that he’s on the wrong track and needs to reverse course. The message is clear enough: No one can force Owen to find his own identity or his own satisfaction in life. No one can make his choices for him, or tell him who he really is.</p>
<p id="nsFT6o">But while the ending is heavy and painful for Owen — and, if we accept Maddy’s version of events, for Isabel — it has a clear purpose beyond scaring, startling, and saddening viewers. It’s a reminder that not making choices is a form of choice — one we have to live with, one that has consequences. It’s a vibrant call to action, and a warning about how passivity and fear can be their own kind of living death. Watching Owen “decay,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23922584">as Schoenbrun puts it</a>, is tragic and alarming — and seemingly meant to show viewers the repercussions of holding still in their lives, of refusing to confront or examine their own questions about themselves. Owen isn’t a classic hero, he’s a cautionary tale about self-repression.</p>
<p id="9Yz1u5">Does that mean <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is real, Isabel is real, Owen is trans, and there’s only one possible way forward for him that doesn’t lead to suffocation and death? Not necessarily. Schoenbrun doesn’t leave him another obvious way out of his oppressive life, but given that he never seems to seek one, or to discuss his feelings of unreality and emptiness with anyone but Maddy, it seems that his inertia and willingness to live in apologetic misery are the problems, not just his refusal to be buried alive. He’s afraid to even explore his feelings with Maddy herself, both as a young man and an old one. He finds it safer to be stuck — and to be baffled, sad, and lonely — than to take action. And Schoenbrun shows us all the consequences of that decision. </p>
<p id="AKdrLz">That metaphor certainly isn’t limited to coming out as queer, or trans. Schoenbrun is reflecting a personal experience and a personal feeling, one that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">some trans viewers certainly identify with</a>. But Owen’s withering, shrinking life is a memorable image for anyone facing similar questions about who they are, who they want to be, and whether they can find a way to that future by exploring their options and choosing change. His story doesn’t ever find a happy ending. But it’s an emotional, heartfelt plea to anyone watching <em>I Saw the TV Glow </em>to go do the frightening work of seeking out one for themselves. </p>

Season 4 begins on May 29 but there are no concrete details on when the <em>Gundam</em> bundles will become available in game. When they do arrive, they will come in the form of three special packs. Combined, the packs give players access to Operator Skins for three iconic suits from the franchise: the RX-78-2, MS-06S Zaku II, and XVX-016 Gundam Aerial. It’s a nice collection of old and new models from the franchise, but I think they should’ve gone wild and made an Operator Skin for iconic antagonist Char Aznable. He’s just a guy in a funny outfit and I want to see him go wild with a machine gun. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Modern Warfare III:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH17YLNC/ref=twister_B0CKT9MSMB?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-warzone-gundam-crossover-1851489124&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CH17YLNC" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/ckYcGZuneYL&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/ckYcGZuneYL" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-cross-gen-bundle---xbox-series-x-and-xbox-one%2F399115.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-cross-gen-bundle---xbox-series-x-and-xbox-one%2F399115.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The packs will also include special death effects, emblems, charms, decals, and more goodies.

<p>Microsoft held its major Surface and AI event on Monday. While it wasn’t livestreamed for people to watch, there <a href="https://x.com/richontech/status/1792603950186959309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is information coming out</a> that pertains to Microsoft’s Copilot and video games.</p>



<p>Microsoft revealed that it will begin working to add Copilot directly into its games. The game shown as an example was Minecraft that will let players use AI to ask if you have the right materials to craft an item. In this instance, the item was a sword.</p>



<p>Copilot then searches the inventory for the materials and tells you if you can make your sword or not.</p>



<p>“You’ve got some sticks, perfect for the sword’s handle,” the Copilot said. “But it looks like you’re missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold, or diamond.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it’s unknown when these features will be added to games like Minecraft or what other games will take advantage of the ability, it’s clear that Microsoft has its sight set on guides and tutorials for gamers. This implementation could go a long way in making the ways of looking up walkthroughs a thing of the past.</p>



<p>How much it’ll be adopted, however, we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
