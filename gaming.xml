<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b0dd8eca985a/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome to August, folks! Let's kick things off right with a fresh edition of What Are You Playing.</p>
<p>It was Direct week over in Nintendo Land, with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Partner Showcase</a> delivering us 25 minutes of... meh. There were some big hitters that we're pleased to see (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>), but we were hoping to be a <em>little</em> more excited by the whole affair.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, new card art in Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-pulls-new-expansion-card-art-amid-accusations-of-plagiarism">landed TPC in hot water</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a> made a surprise appearance on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-a-mouse-game">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, and Microsoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-at-gamescom-2025">playable at Gamescom</a> — we're <em>totally</em> not envious of everyone getting to go hands-on with it...</p>
<p>We also shared our thoughts on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_the_shire_a_the_lord_of_the_rings_game">Tales of the Shire</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_friends">Pokémon Friends</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">Time Flies</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was...</a></p>
<p>Now then, what's team NL up to this weekend?</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I am feeling very much <em>BetweenGamesTM</em> at the moment after polishing off DK and all its related guides. I was hoping to have a little something drop my way in the Direct, but left feeling pretty uninspired, if I'm honest. I'll defo check out the Elliot demo this weekend, and the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">free Switch 2 update</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III</a> has me keen for some more HD-2D action.</p>
<p>Have a good one, friends!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>There aren't many changes in my gaming habits from last week, folks! I'm in the endgame of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and, let me tell you, they've definitely saved the best until last, I'm going to 100% this big banana and nothing is going to stop me from doing so.</p>
<p>I did pick up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date</a>, even though reviews seem a little lower and I was pretty disappointed in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a> (I know that's not a common opinion; I'm sorry!). Still, I love these characters enough that I want to spend more time with them. We'll see! Have a good one!</p>

<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This weekend I’m gonna be digging into a few different things that I’ve picked up in the sale, and I won’t feel bad about telling you that one of them is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">FC 25</a>. I just really needed an on-the-go footie fix, even if it is running at 30fps on my Switch 2.</p>
<p>In much nicer news, I’ll also be having a blast on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a>, which I picked up despite it not scoring quite as highly as I’d hoped in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. I’ve also been making progress in The Hundred Line - Last Defence Academy and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, so both of those will get some loving too.</p>
<p>Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>It is going to be hard to hold out on picking up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/megadrive/earthion">Earthion</a> on Steam, but I really want to play this one on consoles. I did start making progress on Donkey Kong Bananza, and it is such a cathartic experience. Moving on to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/tekken_5">Tekken 5</a> while still progressing my <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> World Tour save and moving upward to battle 25 on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/front_mission_3_remake">Front Mission 3: Remake</a>. The end game is still a long way off...</p>
<p>My game of the week is the incredible, shrewd move by SEGA! In an assault worthy of a true ninja, releasing the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> demo on the same day <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> got its own release was something out of guerrilla '90s marketing. Said entry in the Ninja Gaiden series is not only my game of the week but one of my GOTY candidates. And by the end of this month, I would write the exact same sentence about Shinobi were I not away on vacation. Truly, this is the Summer of the Ninja!</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This weekend, I was going to do a bunch of garden stuff, but the weather is pants, so that means I'm going to stay inside instead. Now that my Tales of the Shire review is done and dusted, I can go back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a>! Yayyyy. I'm on day 80-something, and I hear I have a lot more to do, so I'm looking forward to that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm trying to keep my video game slate fairly open, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/story_of_seasons_grand_bazaar">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> comes out in a month, so I want to make sure I have time to fit it in.</p>
<p>Oh, and I've been playing <strong>Peak</strong> with friends. Very good, although I'm certainly not very good at it. I really need to work on being a team player and not just flinging myself up at cliff faces, then getting stuck...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The biggest announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-digital-showcase-returns-on-august-1st/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">THQ Nordic Digital Showcase 2025</a> is definitely Darksiders 4. After Chronos: Before the Ashes and the two Remnant games, Gunfire Games returns to its historical franchise (the studio was founded by David Adams after the closure of Vigil Games, which developed the first two Darksiders titles). </p>



<p>The previous chapter was released in 2018 to relatively mixed reviews. However, 2019's spin-off <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/darksiders-genesis-top-down-or-third-person-hell-is-still-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darksiders Genesis</a> (developed by Airship Syndicate) fared better and also introduced the final horseman of the apocalypse, Strife (the previous games allowed players to control the others: War, Death, and Fury).</p>



<p>Admittedly, Gunfire and THQ Nordic had teased a new Darkiders title during last year's THQ Nordic Digital Showcase. However, now we have a teaser trailer, and it shows us that the Four Horsemen will all work together for the first time in the franchise. As confirmed by the Steam page, this indeed means that online co-op will be available for the first time in Darksiders.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Choose Your Horseman<br></strong>Take up one of the legendary Horsemen—each with their own unique weapons and combat styles</li>



<li><strong>Cinematic Combat<br></strong>Experience fast-paced, visceral action blending melee, fluid traversal, and supernatural abilities.</li>



<li><strong>Expansive Realms to Explore<br></strong>Journey through apocalyptic landscapes - each teeming with secrets, enemies, and mythic bosses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much else is known at this point, but it's certainly enough to get fans salivating about the series' culmination. Are you eager to end the Eternal War between the forces of Heaven and Hell? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

The completed 2,503-piece figure is 17.5 inches tall and is chock-full of references to other characters and places in Fortnite. Just like in the game, the formidable robot is an amalgamation of five different styles. The robot's blue left leg features a Durrr Burger foot, while the right leg is inspired by Uncle Pete's Pizza Pit and ends with a Tomatohead foot.</p><p>Mecha Team Leader's right arm is even more chaotic, as the Rex inspiration makes it look like a dinosaur is wielding the Sword of Singularity with its teeth. The left arm is modeled after the legendary fox Drift. The beautiful absurdity of the design is rounded out by the Cuddle Team Leader-inspired head and chest armor. Mecha Team Leader is basically a killer robot teddy bear. Sid from Toy Story would be impressed.</p><p>The Lego version of Mecha Team Leader has articulated hips, arms, feet, and a rotating head. A hatch on the robot's chest opens to reveal a cockpit for the included Cuddle Team Leader minifigure. The figure can also be displayed next to the buildable name placard.</p><p>The set includes two bonus outfits for Lego Fortnite the video game: Mecha Team Leader and Mecha Team Shadow.</p><p>Despite Mecha Team Leader's many callbacks to Fortnite lore, this set probably has the broadest appeal of any in the lineup. It would probably look cool on a display shelf next to Lego's Optimus Prime Transformers build. Ironically, Mecha Team Leader launched the same day as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-icons-transformers-soundwave-10358-buying-guide/1100-6533085/" data-ref-id="1100-6533085">Soundwave, the latest addition to the Lego Icons: Transformers</a> lineup.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Fortnite Peely Bone (1,414 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible\/dp\/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Peely-Bone-Collectible/dp/B0DF84KRWH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$92 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Prior to Mecha Team Leader, the Peely Bone buildable statue was the elaborate build in the series. The 1,414-piece display model was one of the four building sets that launched the Lego Fortnite series last fall. Like Mecha Team Leader, Peely Bone is packaged in a black box, which means it's geared toward adult collectors and experienced builders.</p><p>When fully pieced together and connected to the buildable stand, Peely Bone is over 14 inches tall and wields the Peely Pick Pickaxe and Paint Launcher. A Banana Bag Back Bling attaches to his back.</p><p>The included stand with a placard on the front may make Peely seem statuesque, but you can move the figures arms and bend the wrists to create different poses.</p><p>Peely Bone's half-skeleton, half-banana has a practical benefit here for those who enjoy dynamic builds, as you're working with entirely different pieces on each side. Plus, Peely Bone simply looks awesome, and the Lego replica is quite clever from a design perspective.</p><p>Peely Bone, like all of the Lego Fortnite launch sets, includes the in-game Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus. </p><p>At 1,414 pieces, the $100 build offers pretty great value--and even better value right now since it's on sale for $92.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building\/dp\/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Fortnite Supply Llama (691 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building\/dp\/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Fortnite-Supply-Llama-Building/dp/B0DF85X82B?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$34 (was $40)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Supply Llama has been Fortnite's main mascot since launch, and this set lets you piece together your own Llama Piñata out of Lego bricks.

The Supply Llama's mouth can move, too. </p><p>The Supply Llama was a launch set, so you'll get the Operation Brite Starter Pack bonus.</p><p>Even at its full $40 price, the Supply Llama is cheaper than many licensed sets with around 700 pieces.

<p>Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumour-spongebob-squarepants-is-bringing-a-new-game-to-switch-2">a recent rumour</a>, THQ Nordic and Purple Lamp have now officially lifted the lid on the latest SpongeBob SquarePants game.</p>
<p><strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide</strong> will make its debut across multiple platforms including the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>18th November 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now live for <strong>€39.99 / $39.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's a bit about what to expect from the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Prepare to be scared – in the most nautical nonsense kind of way!</strong> When the Flying Dutchman and King Neptune’s egos collide, the result is pure undersea chaos: spectral mayhem spreads across Bikini Bottom, and only two brave(ish) heroes can set things right. SpongeBob and Patrick must team up, combine their unique skills, and (hopefully) stop the total ghostification of their world. From the depths of Neptune’s Palace to the icy peaks of Mount Bikini, fans will explore iconic locations, face epic bosses, and first and foremost: have F.U.N!"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Alongside standard pre-orders, there'll also be a digital deluxe edition and ultimate edition of the game. These versions will include a Tidal Season Pass (also available for separate purchase).</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Order &amp; Digital Editions</strong><br>
Pre-orders are now live! Digital pre-orders include the <em>Natural Costume Pack DLC</em> as a bonus.</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: Base game</li>
<li>Digital Deluxe Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass</li>
<li>Ultimate Edition: Base game + Tidal Season Pass + Natural Costume Pack + SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake (Game) + SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake - Costume Pack (DLC)</li>
</ul>
<div><p><strong>Tidal Season Pass (also available separately)</strong><br>

                <p>The Little Nightmares franchise has been creeping us all out since the original game landed in 2017, and the series continues its trends of unsettling creatures, dangerous exploration, and melancholy stories with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares III</a>. However, unlike the last two entries, Little Nightmares 3 also features online co-op, allowing you to face its eerie world with a friend. There are some limitations to consider, though, so here's what to know about Little Nightmares 3's cross-play and cross-progression functionality.</p><h2>Does Little Nightmares III have cross-play?</h2><p>If you were hoping to team up with friends for a spooky adventure, you may be out of luck. <strong>Little Nightmares 3 doesn't feature cross-play between different ecosystems</strong>. However, it <em>does</em> feature cross-play within different generations of the same ecosystem. Here's how that works:</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Little Nightmares III – 'You're Being Watched' Trailer</p>
      </div>
<ul><li>PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 users can play together.</li><li>Xbox One and Xbox Series X users can play together.</li><li>Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 users can play together.</li><li>PC players can only play with PC players.</li></ul><p>So, while you may not be able to join those on completely different platforms, it's good to know you can still hit up your friends who have previous generation console and bring them along for the ride.</p><p>Even better, <strong>Little Nightmares III comes with a Friend's Pass</strong>, which allows you to <strong>team up in online co-op with only one copy of the game,</strong> similar to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/it-takes-two/" data-ref-id="5000-514264">It Takes Two</a>. You or a friend buys the game, then the other can join at no cost and play through the journey with you. However, you can only play on that save file with that friend going forward, so you'll need to start another save file to play the game in single-player.</p><h2>Does Little Nightmares III have cross-progression?</h2><p>We hate to be the bearer of bad news, but <strong>Little Nightmares III also does not support cross-progression features</strong>. This means that whichever platform you purchase the game on is the one you'll need to finish it on. You won't be able to move your saves between platforms.</p><p>Little Nightmares III launches October 10 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

By the time you finally finish this puzzle, you'll likely want to watch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pixar-movies-in-order">all of the Pixar movies in order</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy a Puzzle or a Poster for Your Wall?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This depends on what you're looking for. Paper movie posters can really capture that traditional feeling of walking into a movie theater when they're in a frame, but puzzle movie posters like the ones above add a fun pop of personality to a room. Since they come in different sizes and styles - especially if you choose to go with one of the collage-style puzzles listed above - and you pieced them together yourself, they can add a nice personal touch to your wall. But again, it all depends on your personal preference of what sort of poster design you'd rather have up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're leaning towards framing the movie poster puzzles listed above, we can help with that, too. You can check out some of our favorite frames for puzzles in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">puzzle gift guide</a> and this <a href="https://zdcs.link/av48p8?object_uuid=f9d1f4ba-9fce-40f0-95e6-df22dc343bc6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RoseArt Jigsaw Puzzle Glue</a> will help you keep your favorite pieces together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 1, 2025 11:52 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-movie-poster-puzzles]]></content:encoded>

Now, after 15 years, the ending of the original game is revisited in the first teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/darksiders-4/" data-ref-id="5000-638028">Darksiders 4</a>. The announcement video recalls Darksiders' closing moments as War is joined by his fellow Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Fury, and Strife.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The sequel was officially unveiled today during THQ Nordic's online preview event. The publisher confirmed that Darksiders 4 will continue the story directly after the first game and allow up to four players to ride together as the Four Horsemen through co-op.</p><p>Darksiders and its sequels take place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a conflict between Heaven and Hell. War was initially blamed for triggering the apocalypse early, and then given the chance to prove his innocence by searching for the one responsible.</p><p>Death and Fury were respectively featured as the leading characters in Darksiders 2 and Darksiders 3. Then Strife took the lead in the 2019 spin-off title, Darksiders Genesis, which moved away from the series' third-person action in favor of a top-down view.</p><p>Darksiders 4 will return to the franchise's third-person perspective, and THQ Nordic states that it will have "cinematic" action that is "fast-paced" and "visceral," with melee and supernatural abilities at players' disposal.</p><p>THQ Nordic hasn't set a date for Darksiders 4 yet, but it will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner, promising more looter shooter shenanigans than ever before with its seamless open world design and exciting new traversal methods. There's a ton to look forward to when the game lands on September 12, and it's certain to keep you busy for many months beyond. But what if your friends are picking the game up on a platform you don't have? And what if you want to carry your saves between different ecosystems? We've got the answers about Borderlands 4's cross-play and cross-progression below.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-play?</h2><p>If you have friends playing on different platforms, we've got some good news for you. Borderlands 4 supports cross-play functionality across every platform, letting you team up with any of your pals for some lootin' and shootin'.</p><p>Before you can begin playing with anyone on another platform, however, you'll need to <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a SHiFT account</a>. This is a "Gearbox account," for all intents and purposes. Without one, you'll be limited to playing with players who own the game on your platform.</p><p>A SHiFT account has other benefits beyond just cross-play functionality, though. It also allows you to redeem SHiFT codes for special in-game items in the Borderlands series. These codes are often shared during various promotions on social media and beyond, so keep an eye out for them.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-progression?</h2><p>As for cross-progression, nothing has been shared about Borderlands 4's cross-save features quite yet. The franchise's two most recent games, Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, did not feature cross-save functionality. So, it would certainly be nice to finally be able to carry save data between different platforms--but we'll have to wait and see if Gearbox goes all-in on this feature. Even if they do, though, it's important to remember that you'd need to purchase the game on every platform you want to move saves between.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version following a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GOG launched a new website Friday where users can claim 13 games that have been delisted from other online sales portals for free. In a press release, GOG wrote that with the giveaway, it and the game publishers taking part are "taking a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves."</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's giveaway--found at the URL <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FreedomToBuy.games</a>, makes the games available for free to users for the next 48 hours. The titles are mostly sexually explicit and were recently delisted from other digital purchasing sites. GOG's site also includes an email link for developers or publishers interested in offering their games for free "as part of the protest."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an archival platform dedicated to protecting gaming history, we believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today--and decades from now," GOG wrote in a press release about the giveaway.</p><p dir="ltr">"We launched FreedomToBuy.games to make a statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder," it continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Sexually explicit games became the focus of controversy in July when thousands were abruptly removed from online game storefronts Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a>. Those removals were the result of pressure on the storefronts from payment processors like Mastercard and Visa to remove games featuring sexual content.</p><p dir="ltr">Payment processors were in turn pressured by a campaign by conservative anti-porn organization Collective Shout, which released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">open letter to payment processors on July 11</a>. The organization said it targeted the removal of games about "rape, incest, and child sexual abuse, and asked its members to <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">call and send emails to payment processors</a>. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported</a>, experts call this tactic "financial censorship," using financial institutions to sidestep platform rules by risking a seller's ability to do business at all. As a result of the campaign, hundreds of games were removed from Steam and, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/itchio-steam-collective-shout-sex-games-consume-me" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a>, more than 20,000 games marked "not safe for work" were removed from Itch. (Itch released a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> regarding the situation and has begun <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-listing some NSFW games</a> if developers choose to make them available for free.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253" data-ratio="0.43043295502312" data-width="2379" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253"></a><figcaption>freedomtoplay.games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backlash to the delisting began immediately, as many developers and players saw the situation as payment processors dictating to adults what content they were allowed to buy and play. Many developers also said that their games were caught up in the delisting sweep not because they contained pornographic content, but because they focused on LGBTQ elements and themes, or dealt with tough topics like sexual abuse.</p><p dir="ltr">Players and developers have taken to social media to put pressure of their own on payment processors to push against what they see as censorship. The International Game Developers Association released a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> where it called for "clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal" in this and similar situations, and directed developers to contact Visa and Mastercard directly, and to petitions from the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Change.org</a> pushing back on censorship from payment processors.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Both Mastercard and Visa have issued statements</a> saying the companies do not make moral judgments about merchandise sold by partners, and both suggested there was an issue of potential illegality at the heart of the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p dir="ltr">Visa made a similar statement to Polygon, saying it requires "enhanced safeguards" for merchants facing "an elevated risk of illegal activity."</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not make moral judgments on legal purchases made by consumers," the statement said. "Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p><p dir="ltr">No claims of potential illegality have been made about any games removed from platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's FreedomToBuy.games website leads with a statement that could be seen as addressing the legality argument.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some games vanish. Not because they broke the law but because someone decided they shouldn’t exist," the site reads. "For 48 hours, these games are free, because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/darksiders-4">Darksiders 4</a> has been announced, with Gunfire Games continuing the apocalyptic adventure in yet another new direction. In development for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, your horseman won’t be going it alone this time…</p>
<p><iframe title="Darksiders 4 | Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As described on the Steam page entry, Darksiders 4 is a third person action adventure game with combat, traversal and puzzle solving. You’ll get to play as one of the four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, each with their own weapons and combat styles, but all equally capable of cleaving through enemies, traversing the environments and drawing upon supernatural abilities.</p>
<p>Oh, and the story is going to continue on from where the first game left off, pushing the world narrative forward in a major way.</p>
<p>While it’s not stated within the blurb, the Steam page does have the tag for online co-op on it, while the PlayStation Store page also notes 4 player multiplayer</p>

<p>Sadly there’s no mention of a release date or even year, and given how regularly games reappear in THQ Nordic’s summer showcases – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">this was first teased last summer</a> – we’d guess that means that 2026 is out of the window. Pray for 2027?</p>
<p>What will be fascinating is to see how Gunfire blends that with different action adventure subgenres. We’ve seen a Zelda-like, more of a looter RPG, Soulslike, and even top-down isometric. While it’s the most different game, Darksiders Genesis was the most recent title in the franchise. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/03/darksiders-genesis-review/">our review</a>, all the way back in 2019, Dom said, “Despite the fundamental changes to the series’ viewpoint, Darksiders Genesis feels like a true Darksiders game, and banishes any memory of the lacklustre third entry.”</p>

The studio will allegedly work to overhaul the story in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioShock 4's struggles have also apparently resulted in the removal of Cloud Chamber Games studio head Kelley Gilmore, and the shifting of creative director Hogarth de la Plante into a publishing role. Employees were told in a recent all-hands that the company needs to become, per Bloomberg, "more agile and efficient," which has some workers afraid layoffs may be on the horizon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games confirmed Gilmore and de la Plante's role changes to Bloomberg, and shared the following statement:</p><blockquote>We are working hard to set BioShock up for the best possible future. Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg's report also revealed that a BioShock 1 remake was in development at 2K, but was canceled earlier this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We first heard reports that BioShock 4 was in development <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/13/2k-studio-reportedly-developing-new-bioshock">way back in 2018</a>, when it was still apparently pretty early in the process. The following year it was officially <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/09/new-bioshock-game-confirmed-being-developed-by-new-developer-cloud-chamber">confirmed to be in development at new studio Cloud Chamber</a>, but IGN was told at the time that the team was at "the earlier end of our process." It was also confirmed that original BioShock creative director Ken Levine was not working on the game, but was instead focusing on his own project, Judas, at Ghost Story Games (it's due. However, a number of other BioShock veterans were said to be working on it, including de la Plante, art director Scott Sinclair, and design director Jonathan Pelling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the years since, we've gleaned very little in the way of details on BioShock 4. From job listings, we've put together that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-setting-rapture-columbia-job-listings">won't take place in any of the settings from previous games</a>, and that it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-bioshock-game-hiring-writer-for-open-world-setting">may be open-world</a>. In 2022, it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-writer-joins-bioshock-4-as-narrative-lead">picked up former Ghost of Tsushima writer</a> Liz Albl as a narrative lead. And last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-bioshock-4-image-tells-us-next-to-nothing-about-the-game">an image that may have come from the in-progress new BioShock leaked online</a>, though it was allegedly from an early 2021 demo of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given that we have yet to see gameplay or hear even a whisper of a release window, it may still be a while yet before BioShock 4 fully emerges. In the meantime, while Levine's Judas was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-story-games-judas-is-currently-planned-for-release-by-march-2025">at one point expected to be out by March 2025</a>, that deadline has come and gone. But we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/judas-gameplay-overview-of-bioshock-creators-next-game">got a preview of the game last March</a>, so it may have to serve to tide over fans until BioShock 4 is ready to emerge once more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-have-to-hear-chris-plante%E2%80%99s-sandwich-story.1260312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a> is primarily a show about the news – and there’s plenty of talk about The Issues on this week’s episode – but sometimes a moment stops you dead in your tracks, and you’ve got to share it with the world. That could aptly describe both Chris Plante’s sandwich story and my experience of hearing him tell it. Anyway, without further ado…</p><p>Well, with a bit more ado: This week Chris (Person) and I are joined by an additional <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris (Plante)</a> – and also, to complete the bit, I’ve legally changed my name to Chris. We begin by discussing Plante’s life following his tenure as editor-in-chief at Polygon, which came to <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-staff-goodbye" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an abrupt halt earlier this year</a> for reasons with which Aftermath readers and listeners are depressingly familiar. On the upside, he’s launched a new show, <a href="https://shows.acast.com/post-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Post Games</a>, and it’s very good!&nbsp;</p><p>We discuss the whys and hows of his interview-focused podcast before delving into the big news of the week: Incensed by the removal of NSFW games on Itch and Steam following pressure from payment processors – which, in turn, were pressured by an activist group called Collective Shout – artists and fans have <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off a mass call campaign</a> of their own, targeting Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Stripe specifically. Will it work? And in what universe is it appropriate for bank companies and payment processors to even be making decisions about what we’re allowed to watch and play in the first place?&nbsp;</p><p>Then Chris (Person) enthuses about <em>Death Stranding 2</em> – which he recently finished – and Chris (Plante) tells the wildest story about a sandwich any of us have ever heard.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can afford a really long sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for clarity, but certainly not length (of sandwich)):</p><p><strong>Person: </strong>Battery Park is an unnatural place, physically. It shouldn’t exist. It has one of the best weird movie theaters: the Regal down there. Because nobody knows that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Plante: </strong>When we lived there, we went there all the time, and I… can I share a really quick Regal story? Because it’s one of the most bonkers things.&nbsp;</p><p>So my wife and I, we were dating at the time, and we both got off work. She was working in production; I was freelance. Anyway, we were like “Oh, we want to go see <em>Edge Of Tomorrow: Live, Die, Repeat</em>, and we can go do it in the middle of the day. It’s gonna be, like, Tuesday at 10:40 AM.” And we go down to this theater, and as you’re describing, nobody knows it exists despite it being humongous – built into a skyscraper on the southwest side of Manhattan. It just does not make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>So we go in, and we go up this giant cavern, and we go into the movie. It’s 10:40 on a Tuesday. Nobody’s there at 7 PM on a Friday, so it’s empty. We sit, and this one dude comes in right as the trailers are starting, and he’s wearing the biggest trench coat I’ve ever seen, and he’s holstering something in it that looks like it’s about, like, two or three feet tall and thin. And he really does not want us to see it. We are at this point like “Well, this isn’t great.”</p><p>The trailers start, and every time a sexy thing happens in a trailer, this dude just goes “Mmmm.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh no.</p><p><strong>Person:</strong> Don’t like that.</p><p><strong>Plante</strong>: The whole time! So we’re like “Oh noooooo.” And then we’re like “Do we move?” We were doing that thing where you look at each other but you don’t want to say anything, and you’re kinda mumbling. He was literally just a seat or two down.&nbsp;</p><p>And then as the movie starts, he reaches in, and we’re like “Well, here it is. This is the end for us.”</p><p>And he pulls out the biggest sub sandwich I have ever seen. HUUUUGE. And then he proceeds to, for the first half hour of this movie, duck-style eat this sandwich. It never leaves the front of his face. He never lowers it. It just begins outstretched and slowly disappears into his body. Tomato and lettuce and vinegar and olive oil are spilling everywhere. It’s somehow getting on us. But we’re so happy that we’re not gonna die.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like being in the front row at Sea World.</p><p><strong>Plante:</strong> That scene in the movie where Emily Blunt – it’s in every trailer – where she bends down in a weird way, like yoga positions… the noise that came from this man. The mix of sexuality, joy, and hunger, I will never forget it.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/death-stranding-2-covid-lockdown-hideo-kojima"><h3>Death Stranding 2 Is A Joyful, Absurd Response To COVID</h3></a><p>Goofy, lighthearted, constantly mugging: Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an exercise in spectacle, a rumination on lockdown, and one of the most human games Kojima has made in years</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/harry-potter-jk-rowling-cge-codenames-board-game"><h3>Board Game Company Fucks Around (Announcing A New Harry Potter Game), Finds Out (When Fans Revolt And Media Announce Boycotts)</h3></a><p>'It’s a product to sell to people who prioritise their nostalgia for children’s fantasy over the culture their trans friends and family live in'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research"><h3>‘Dopamine Simply Doesn’t Work Like That’: An Interview With A User Experience Researcher</h3></a><p>'Part of the reason I have worked in games UXR and not, say, microwave UX, is that games can be designed to be hard'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steam-itch-porn-censorship-collective-shout-visa-mastercard-paypal"><h3>Inside The Mass Call Campaign To Stop Video Game Censorship [Update]</h3></a><p>"This is a marathon, not a race," say organizers who plan to keep calling payment processors for months, if need be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clues-by-sam-wordle-daily-puzzle-game"><h3>Clues By Sam Is My Favorite Daily Puzzle Game</h3></a><p>It’s a nice little thing to do as my last thing before falling asleep.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-chris-plante-sandwich-post-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next game in the BioShock series, which is currently referred to as BioShock 4, is reportedly having some major problems in development, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDA3NDMxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzU0Njc5MTE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMEJXRTJHUTFZV1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Zt4Beo52NA1y9AxmXB4Bd38T64ITJqEG1fTMqnDAfZU">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> reports that it recently failed a check-in review with Take-Two and 2K leadership, which resulted in major changes being ordered to the game's narrative, and two of developer Cloud Chamber's creative leadership being removed from their roles into other areas of the company.</p>



<p>The report also reveals that a remake of the first BioShock game was in the works before it was "<em>shelved</em>" earlier this year, according to Bloomberg's sources.</p>







<p>Kelley Gilmore, studio head at Cloud Chamber, was removed from her role as studio head and moved into a position on the publishing side of things, as a result of BioShock 4 failing its recent review, and Hogarth de la Plante, creative director at Cloud Chamber, suffered the same fate, and is now in a publishing role. </p>



<p>2K reportedly told Cloud Chamber's staff that they need to be "<em>more agile and efficient,"</em> which Schreier adds now has staff concerned that layoffs are around the corner.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to Bloomberg in response to questions sent in regarding this report, 2K Games said, "<em>We are working hard to set </em><em>BioShock</em> up for the best possible future. <em>Right now, we have a good game, but we are committed to delivering a great one. We are working closely with leadership at the studio to define this path</em>." The same spokesperson also confirmed the role changes for Gilmore and de la Plante.</p>



<p>BioShock 4 has reportedly been in development <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/">in some form or another since 2015</a>, or should we say at least since then, as Schreier adds that the game has been in development for "<em>more than a decade</em>," referring to his prior reporting that Certain Affinity had been working on the next BioShock game since at least 2015.</p>



<p>We only (<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-new-game-top-secret-2k-studio/">officially</a>) learned that BioShock 4 was coming in 2019, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cloud-chamber-taking-care-of-the-next-bioshock-game-2k-reveals/">Cloud Chamber announced as the studio helming the project</a>. In 2023, there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-bioshock-was-rebooted-again-last-summer-says-leaker/">claims that the game had been internally rebooted for a second time</a>, after suffering a reboot in 2018. Last year, we saw Cloud Chamber looking to ramp up development with <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/">multiple job listings posted</a>, and that was essentially the most recent sign of life we've seen from the studio on BioShock 4.</p>



<p>The lack of any concrete information on the game for more than a decade is as good a sign as any that it's struggling in development, because surely if it were anywhere near release, 2K and Take-Two would have already been shouting about it from rooftops. But today's report shows that Take-Two aren't convinced that BioShock 4 is where it needs to be yet.</p>



<p>Of course, there's a stark difference between what a great game looks like for bean-counting executives versus the developers actually working on it. There's more than a slight chance that this failure could be the result of Take-Two just not believing that the current path for BioShock 4 won't be the one that sells the most copies. That doesn't mean it isn't a great game in its current state.</p>



<p>Regardless, it's clear we'll have to continue waiting to see what happens with the next BioShock game. Hopefully, it'll be worth the wait.</p>

              <p>Danny Shnorhokian has been going to Evo since before it was called that. <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-best-moments-in-pro-gaming-history-5820907">The biggest fighting game event of the year</a> started as a small tournament back in the late ’90s called Battle by the Bay that focused solely on <em>Street Fighter</em>. Decades later, the annual event’s mainstage features everything from household names like <em>Mortal Kombat</em> to newer franchises like the anime fighter <em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em>. <em>Street Fighter</em> remains the top-billed event at every Evo though, and its legacy is inseparable from the passion and fandom that brings thousands of fighting game players to the Nevada desert each summer. That legacy includes the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series, which is returning to the main event at Evo 2025 for the first time in 15 years, and which all began with the 1996 arcade classic <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter.</em></p> <p>Most people first came to the flashy pixel art superhero crossover through <em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2.</em> That’s what Shnorhokian started out playing in Southern California in the early aughts (he placed in the top 8 at Evo 2008). But he later doubled back to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWwgYSQUG0">equally gorgeous, even more broken original</a>, and was inspired to start holding annual side tournaments for it during Evo. “In 2005, EVO moved to Vegas, and allowed players (like myself) to run a side tournament if you had the resources,” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. Back then it required having the original arcade cabinets on site, even as modern fighting games migrated primarily to console. “Me and a player named Dogface organized a tournament, which had about 30 entrants! Players from all over the country and even Japan participated. So from 2005 to 2010, I helped organize tournaments for the game.”</p> <p>Things petered out after that, even as Evo itself became larger than ever. Fans of smaller arcade fighting game classics like <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> relied on online matchmaking services like Fightcade to stay connected. Last year, however, Shnorhokian was able to bring the game back to Evo ahead of Capcom releasing it on modern platforms as part of <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classic</em>s. “This year, thankfully we can run it on Steam, and that makes it easier for everyone,” he said. “It has all three versions of <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em>, and people can use their own controller. Plus everyone can play this game at home and online to practice. A $50 game is a lot easier to get your hands on instead of a $300 arcade board.”</p> <p>Evo has changed a lot over the years, including being <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-buys-evo-1846507520">sold to Sony</a> during the pandemic and amid a <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-street-fighter-pulled-from-evo-online-by-1844253712">sexual misconduct scandal</a>. Fan favorites like <em>Smash Bros.</em> are no longer at the event, but a greater emphasis on retro games has brought back many of the games that first ignited players’ imaginations in arcades years ago. 2024 saw the return of <em>Street Fighter 3: Third Strike</em> and this year it’s <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> 2’s turn. But it’s the dozens of side tournaments and casual after-hours meetups where the old arcade culture lives on most.</p> <p>“Sponsored teams with players competing on national television for millions of dollars is something I would never have imagined,” Shnorhokian said. “When I got $50 for Top 8 at EVO, that felt HUGE. It’s a whole different world now. But even with the ups and downs, I do love Evo. It’s a great chance to see old friends, make new ones, meet players from around the world, and share the love of fighting games. Even if it was just 2 people, I’d want to organize an <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> tournament. I love the game, and whoever wins cans say they’re the ‘World Champion.'”</p>  <p>He hopes it’s him, but this year’s event has 20 people registered so far, including the Japanese Evo 2025 Champion Momoten, last year’s runner-up ken240sx, and fellow tournament organizer Majin Obama. “Infinite combos are definitely going to be done throughout the tournament,” Shnorhokian said. “It’s the person who has the patience to land the hit that’s going to make them the winner.”</p>  <p>The<em> X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> side tournament kicks off at 7:00 p.m. ET, but the rest of Evo will go throughout the weekend and late into Sunday night. Games begin each day around 1:00 p.m. ET across half a dozen livestreams culminating in the final top 8 for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> on August 3 around 11:00 p.m. ET. A full schedule of the event can found <a href="https://evo.gg/events/usa2025">here</a>.</p>
