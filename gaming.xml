		<p>We are in a golden age for indie horror right now. Titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">HollowBody</a> have taken the genre into new directions whilst clearly showing reverence for the games that inspired them. In an era of flashy remakes and increasing focus on graphical fidelity it is nice to have games that concentrate on the looks and feel of the PS1 classics. The latest entry in this field is Becrowned, a true retro survival horror that more than borrows from Konami’s Silent Hill series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Becrowned – Official First Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Er73I15tbls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central protagonist is a man named Richard Torrance, but with he demo starting <em>in media res</em> rather than being the opening section of the game, there’s not much more to say about him than that. The Steam page describes him as a ‘man of strong will and unbreakable character’ which sounds like the beginning of a hubristic journey to me. There seems to be some kind of Dante-esque story with definite themes of punishment and regret which has always worked for the more psychologically infused Silent Hill over the action focus of Resident Evil.</p>


<p>That being said, there is plenty of combat included in the Becrowned demo, including a familiar feeling boss fight. The sense of familiarity is exacerbated by the demo being set in a hospital, further bringing it into direct comparison with its predecessors. The staccato movement of the enemies and their inhuman appearances are straight out of the Masahiro Ito playbook and fit right into the dark and grimy environments. You find both melee weapons and guns to fight off these foes but ammo is limited – although not as severely so as in some other games.</p>


<p>There doesn’t seem to be inventory management at play here, which seems to be a common shift in the current generation of indie horror. I can see the generic appeal of juggling items but it isn’t something I miss when games remove the limitation. Puzzles involve finding items and unlocking blocked areas with a couple of really well designed examples in the demo. One puzzle in particular requires you to interpret a poem in order to rearrange a bookshelf filled with Gothic classics – not surprisingly, as an English Literature lecturer this felt laser targeted to my interests.</p>
<p>Graphically, Becrowned looks suitably dingy and hellish, although the devs have shared some more expansive and open environments on social media, so there may be a welcome variety in the full game. Most of the demo takes place in very tight corridors but it is possible to dodge enemies in traditional survival horror fashion. The retro aesthetic is further achieved through a VHS-esque filter that gives the grainy effect that we know and love. Sound effects are creepy and atmospheric with unpleasant slapping footsteps and inhuman screams.</p>

<p>While my experience with the game was a positive one, there are some notes of caution to raise. Rather than being loosely inspired by Silent Hill, Becrowned currently needs to find more of an identity of its own. HollowBody managed this through the futuristic British urban setting and I’m keen to find out how 13th Street Studio will push this incredibly solid foundation into something that stands on its own merits. The reliance on radio static and the hospital setting feels like an overzealous tribute to Konami’s series. Running felt a little clumsy at times and there seems to be an overly punishing stamina system in place which makes dodging through groups of enemies a little hit and miss. There are also some balancing issues to work through, especially with one enemy having a spit attack with an overpowered range and damage, whilst the boss fight could benefit from a little more signposting (and possibly not being a one-hit kill).</p>
<p>I enjoyed my time playing through the demo a couple times. The first time I took my time to fully explore and think through the puzzles whilst trying to collect every item I could, whilst the second was more of a speed run. The latter is helped by the puzzle solutions being static rather than randomised so you can sequence break to some extent by opening coded doors out of order – doing so too liberally will result in you not gaining the essential firepower you’ll need for the boss fight though.</p>
<p>Becrowned truly captures the essence of classic Silent Hill and will make for a really interesting comparison to the Bloober Team remake coming out soon. With a little more confidence in finding its own identity it could even look to compete with these classics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-was-one-of-the-rare-opportunities-says-krafton-regarding-tango-gameworks-acquistion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a short time since the South Korean publisher Krafton decided to save Tango Gameworks, acquiring the studio in August after Microsoft decided to shutter it just a few months prior. While Krafton has acquired Tango Gameworks, the only IP they acquired along with it was Hi-Fi Rush, which happened to be a BAFTA-winning rhythm game that reached three million players. The decision to shutter Tango Gameworks came as a huge surprise to many, especially after making a game as successful as Hi-Fi Rush. Tango Gameworks is also responsible for The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, but unfortunately, those IPs were not acquired by Krafton.</p>
<p>Krafton now has a dozen studios under its belt, which includes Bluehole Studio, Neon Giant, PUBG Studios and now, Tango Gameworks as it's 13th acquisition. However, they aren't planning to stop there with acquisitions, and want to continue to expand their library.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Maria Park, the head of Corporate Development over at Krafton it was explained how the acquisition came to be and what it meant for Krafton as well as for Tango Gameworks.&nbsp; Park explains that in an attempt to diversify their portfolio, they have met with 200 to 300 studios in the last quarter alone in an attempt to find new developers to invest in. As a result, this led to the acquisition of Tango Gameworks, where they immediately flew over to Tokyo to meet with Tango.</p>
<p>While with most acquisitions, a lot of the staff are either axed or left of their own free will, Krafton has made efforts to keep on as many of the pre-existing staff from the company as possible. Out of 100 Tango employees, at least 70 to 80 are moving over to work at Krafton, with some of the positions being backfilled. However, they expect that the numbers will end up at around 100 by the end of the year or the beginning of 2025.</p>
<p>In the interview, it's stated that Tango was <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-says-krafton-ceo/">already working on Hi-Fi Rush 2</a> by the time Krafton started talking with them. When it came to getting the IP from Microsoft, they were surprised that they were lucky enough to obtain it. "We spoke with Phil Spencer directly, and we have their direct support. He has been incredibly accommodating to the needs of the Tango team."</p>
<p>Park states that they have been doing thorough research into the Japanese market for a year. "It was hard to find small to medium-sized studios who are in pursuit of their own titles. a lot of them were work-for-hire studios. This was one of the rare opportunities."</p>
<p>As a result, acquiring Tango is the first significant investment in the Japanese video game market, and they are making sure to be cautious. "We'll continue to pursue opportunities in the Japanese market for sure, but it's not like we'll be actively investing in a high number of studios over a short period. Yes, there'll be more to come for sure."</p>
<p>While the acquisition has taken a while, most of the team from Tango was onboarded in early August, and Krafton were talking to Microsoft once or twice a week during August to make sure that the acquisition went smoothly.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/devolver-announces-new-publishing-label-for-licensed-indie-games.997425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced a brand new publishing wing called Big Fan Games, which is dedicated to publishing indie games based on existing licenses.</p>
<p>In a press release, Big Fan says that it thinks there's "room for a new approach" when it comes to licensed games. The studio says its goal is to give indie studios the chance to "make the call", take risks, and explore unique game ideas that "aren't dictated by spreadsheets".</p>
<p>The publishing label will be staffed by a "small but passionate team of industry veterans" with experience working with intellectual properties like&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hellboy</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=UR11cj8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=-ypaxQHH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big Fan Games is now the retroactive publisher for&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devolver-launches-big-fan-games-a-publishing-label-dedicated-to-movie-tv-and-comic-book-adaptations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Big Fan currently has "six active projects in development", although the studio is tight-lipped about what those projects are and what they're based on.</p>
<p>The studio says its aim is to release around four or five games a year, and it's also taking suggestions from indie developers and studios regarding licensed projects they might be working on.</p>
<p>Retroactively, the publishing label has also claimed a number of games previously published by fellow Devolver subsidiary Good Shepherd, including&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/john-wick-hex"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<p>Judging by a <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/big-fan-working-in-partnership-with-rebellion-to-create-games-based-on-the-iconic-2000-ad-universe-copy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather strange official announcement</a>, it's also apparent that Big Fan is now the publishing label that will be working alongside Rebellion to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/good-shepherd-rebellion-2000-ad">create a game based in the&nbsp;<em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, best known for authoritarian anti-hero Judge Dredd.</p>
<p><em>John Bi</em></p>

<p>Given that we don't currently know what projects are in the works at the studio (except for the aforementioned <em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>game, of course), it's difficult to guess whether or not that's true, but stay tuned to find out more about what Big Fan is up to.</p>

Even so, through some magical mumbo jumbo, Basim ends up alive in the game’s modern-day segments, and his plans are one of the major cliffhangers at the end of the game. <em>Mirage </em>was originally going to be an expansion for <em>Valhalla</em>, but after Ubisoft spun it out into its own game, Basim got to be the star of a mainline <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>title.</p><p>While the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series has turned into an open-world RPG series, <em>Mirage </em>is considered a “back to basics” for the franchise. In his review, <em>Kotaku</em>’s Zack Zwiezen described it as more akin to the “smaller, more stealth-focused adventures” of the early entries before Ubisoft made the pivot to bigger maps and longer run-times. So if you were worried about overwhelming yourself with two big, open-world <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games in the span of four months, <em>Mirage </em>is a lot less to chew on than <em>Shadows </em>will likely be in February.<br></p><p>And if you own an Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S, it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9NZCJF5VF1NV&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9NZCJF5VF1NV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">half off right now and will only run you $24.99</a></span>. The game is Smart Delivery compatible, which means if you buy it on one system you’ll get it on both.

Developer Saber Interactive worked closely with Games Workshop over Space Marine 2’s four-year development to ensure it was as authentic as possible, right down to the nuts and bolts of a Space Marine’s armor.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits discussed its working relationship with Games Workshop, and some of the challenges it faced ensuring Space Marine 2 passed all those lore checks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“Let me give you an example,” Willits began, “the ankle armor we had, the ankle armor was the wrong size and they told us that the ankle armor was wrong.”</p><p>It’s a funny problem to fix, but building a virtual Space Marine was no mean feat. After all, Space Marines were introduced in 1987 with nary a thought for how they might be made to work on a video game battlefield.</p><p>“45 years ago when the guy that made the little Space Marine that sat on the table, he probably was not imagining them animating in a video game 45 years later,” Willits said. “And let me tell you, that was hard to make it.

Willits said he understood why Games Workshop is so protective over Warhammer 40,000, even if it can sometimes cause a slight headache for other companies working with the license. </p><p>“They are very protective,” he said. “But you have to be. When you have a universe as big as Games Workshop has with Warhammer, you have to protect it like it's your baby, because it is.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-this-is-the-most-un-nintendo-like-thing-nintendo-has-ever-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Although many are labeled with the moniker ‘legend’, few deserve it more than Shigeru Miyamoto. His influence on video games is perhaps more far reaching than any other individual, and in the 45-plus years he’s been at Nintendo, he’s been responsible for creating many of the world’s most-loved games. To many, he <em>is</em> Nintendo. But on the eve of Tokyo Game Show, he’s talking about the most “un-Nintendo-like” thing the company has ever created. </p><p>“You could say that we’re sort of doing something that we are not supposed to do,” Miyamoto reveals. “If [ex-president of Nintendo Hiroshi] Yamauchi would hear this, I think he would tell us to stop immediately!”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/img-3704-m2va-1727783597767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Surprisingly, he is talking about the newly opened Nintendo Museum, a two-storey interactive celebration of everything Nintendo, situated in Kyoto, Japan, where the company was founded. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview"><u>IGN visited the museum recently</u></a> and, just like Nintendo, it’s a place where fun is at the heart of everything.</p><p>“We wanted to do something appropriate to our identity,” says Miyamoto, talking about how Nintendo always has a certain way of doing things. Previously, the company always shied away from talking about its past. With the gaming landscape constantly changing, though, it decided now was the time to celebrate all of its achievements… but only if it felt authentically Nintendo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>“Nintendo is a company that connects with its consumers through products,” Miyamoto explains. “We do not promote the company itself, only the products. We might be talking about how old Mario has turned but we don’t talk about how many units a certain game has sold. That’s what Nintendo has traditionally been doing, but the environment has changed and we started to revisit that thought.”</p><p>That’s not to say the Nintendo Museum is a mecca that only celebrates Nintendo’s commercial success. In fact it’s nothing like that. But from the decades of history on display, it’s clear to see that only one thing really matters to Nintendo – the games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/img-9640-1727782315234.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who doesn't want a giant, cuddly N64 controller?!</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I feel that the only way to connect and communicate with the consumer is through the product,” Miyamoto says. It’s a position that echoes the thoughts of the ex-Nintendo president Horishi Yamauchi, who ran the company for over 50 years and was responsible for turning it into the global entertainment success it is today. “Yamauchi used to say that a lot of companies put a lot of effort and resources into sales to make sure that the product is advertised well so that it reaches greater sales”, says Miyamoto. “However, Yamauchi’s own philosophy was the opposite. He believed that if you need to over-advertise something to sell, not selling it at all is better.”</p><p>A museum that showcases the story of the company behind the games and consoles is almost antithetical to this philosophy of ‘show not tell’, so it’s no wonder Miyamoto thinks his old boss might not be in favor of the project if he were still alive today. But since its founding in 1889, Nintendo’s century old history has begun to pile up. Perhaps sensing its own age, the idea came to turn an old Nintendo factory into its first ever museum. “Nintendo has a lot of material that we have accumulated over the years. Some of that is deteriorating and some of it has been thrown away,” Miyamoto explains. “Over the years, we started to realize the importance of preserving these materials.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of companies put a lot of effort into sales to make sure a product is advertised well so it reaches greater sales. But [ex-Nintendo president Horishi] Yamauchi's own philosophy was that if you need to over-advertise something to sell, not selling it at all is better</p></div><p>The preservation extends to the building itself, too, and Miyamoto “thought that it would be very Nintendo-like to not have a flashy museum but to simply repurpose this building and this land that we had as an effort to store and preserve the products that we have made in the past.”</p><p>Rather than simply tell a straight historical story that stretches from 1889 to today, Nintendo enlisted the help of its various technicians, employees “with various knowledge and interests that go beyond just video games,” to create a museum that only Nintendo could imagine.</p><p>The result is an experience unlike any other. During our tour we saw exhibitions that tell the story of Nintendo through interactive experiences, like large-scale Nintendo game controllers that can be used to play games with a friend, or a station where guests can create their own Hanafuda cards, the Japanese playing cards etched into Nintendo lore. It has more in common with a theme park than a traditional museum, and just as interactivity is central to Nintendo’s history as an entertainment company, it’s also central to the Nintendo Museum.</p><p>“I had never created a museum so it was quite a different experience for me,” Miyamoto recalls. “But from the midway point we were constantly making iterations and fixes, which felt very similar to making video games.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Merch</h3></div></output><p>One of the takeaways we had following our visit to the museum is that, ironically, there’s very little history in this celebration of the past. While the interactive exhibits highlight Nintendo’s ability to inject fun and gameplay into anything from amusement parks and movies to LEGO toys, there were too few exhibits that peeled back the curtain on how Nintendo created some of our favorite games or consoles. Miyamoto says this is partly by design, but also something that will change in the future.</p><p>“Every year we have about a hundred or two hundred new employees that join our company and I have a talk of over two hours with them to explain what kind of company we are,” Miyamoto says. “However, after 20 years, I don’t really look forward to doing that same talk again next year anymore.”</p><p>The museum, therefore, is meant to give employees – and visitors – a version of Miyamoto’s talk, designed to be accessible by everyone: “If we were going to tell our employees what kind of company Nintendo is, we thought it might be good to share that with the public as well.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Like Nintendo itself, the museum is something that will evolve over time. What it looks like next year might be very different from what it is today. “We are currently in the process of planning next steps in what to include for the future,” Miyamoto reveals. “Initially the museum was based on the fact that we were only going to exhibit products. But when I put myself in the customer’s perspective, I do want to see at least a little bit of stuff from behind the curtains.”</p><p>Miyamoto points out that the Nintendo Museum currently has prototypes for controllers and consoles that have never been seen before, nor can they be seen anywhere else. There are also plans to exhibit artworks and rarities from its games, and Miyamoto suggests that, after making 10 movies or so, maybe Nintendo could even add a movie theater to the museum.</p><p> Nintendo currently has no plans to set up other museums around the world, so if you want to experience “the most un-Nintendo-like” creation the company has ever made, you’ll need to visit the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto. When asked if he has a particular favorite exhibit, Miyamoto says it’s the section dedicated to the Nintendo Wii, the company’s 2006 motion controller-based console: “The Wii is special to me. At the time, I and [former Nintendo president Satoru] Iwata felt that games were becoming something specifically for gamers and we wanted to change that by creating something that could be experienced by anybody. That was the driving force behind the Wii, and it was something that we were kind of able to actually accomplish. Looking at the photos of families playing together, it makes me happy to think that the population of people that play games increased because of the Wii.”</p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will arrive in January and promises to be the most terrifying chapter yet, obviously.</p>
<p>Though previous chapters are available on consoles too, this fourth chapter has so far only been announced for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">Steam</a> where pre-orders are now live.</p>
<p>The third chapter was the largest to date, but developer Mob Entertainment is making Chapter Four the darkest and most intense yet, with new levels and characters and "unexpected twists" to expand on franchise lore.</p>

<p>"As we continue the epic story of Poppy Playtime, our lore goes deeper, introducing both helpful and harmful characters, greater risks as players uncover more of Playtime Co., and more extreme horror elements that create new scenarios players must survive making Chapter Four the scariest of the franchise," said Seth Belanger co-founder and CCO of Mob Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've really pushed the boundaries with this chapter in terms of making the lore even darker and the environments more dangerous. Simply exploring these locations will give you goosebumps.</p>
<p>"Our team has poured a lot into crafting an experience that is as terrifying as it is engaging, and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it."</p>
<p>Co-founder Zach Belanger added: "We're excited to introduce new, spine-chilling characters and environments that expand on our ever-evolving story, while also delivering the biggest shocks and thrills in the series yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Mob Entertainment released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtimes-second-and-third-chapters-will-arrive-on-xbox-later-this-month">second and third chapters of Poppy Playtime on Xbox</a>, matching the PC release.</p>
<p>The first chapter is available on PS4, PS5, and Switch, with the remaining two yet to follow.</p>
<p>Collectively, Poppy Playtime has become a hugely successful horror franchise, following the antics of scary toys like Huggy Wuggy, Mommy Long Legs, and CatNap.</p>
<p>Further, earlier this year the studio announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation is in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company," said the co-founders at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Currently working on multiple projects.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Devolver Digital [378 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> has announced the launch of <a title="Companies > Big Fan Games" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/big-fan-games">Big Fan Games</a>, a new video games publishing label dedicated to adaptations of entertainment brands. <span id="more-918944"></span></p><p>Through the label, Big Fan Games will give developers the chance to create original game adaptations using the worlds and characters of iconic film, television, and comic properties.</p><p>Big Fan Games is currently working on projects from “rad media properties” developed by independent developers.</p><p>Here is the full message from the label on its launch:</p><blockquote><p>Like you, we’re really into games. But when it comes to “licensed games,” we think there’s room for a new approach. One where indie developers get to make the call. To take some risks and explore unique ideas that aren’t dictated by spreadsheets. So we formed Big Fan to help make that dream a reality. From a team that carries a deep bench of experience working with games and entertainment properties like <em>Dune</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, The <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Hellboy</em>, <em>Evil Dead</em>, <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em>, <em>Power Rangers</em>, and more.</p><p>We believe (and have seen firsthand) that great games that propel existing franchises can offer a connection with a fan that only an interactive experience can offer. Independent games created in these universes can explore them in new and unexpected ways, and it’s our goal to raise the bar of what fans can expect.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Drawing inspiration from beloved franchises, we strive to bring these worlds closer to fans—both old and new—through the lens of creative teams driven by their passion for the material. We support developers by providing our industry expertise and the resources they need to bring their ideas to life. Our goal at Big Fan is to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.</p><p>It’s easy for us to make grand statements in a press release, but we like to think we can back them up. Collectively, we’ve published a lot of different games on a lot of different platforms, some of which you might have even heard of. Our work includes collaborations with like-minded teams at Disney, Dark Horse Comics, Rebellion, Lionsgate, and more. We are actively working with these partners right now, with more on the way.</p><p>Have a favorite game you’ve always dreamed of rebooting or a cult classic film or book you’d love to see adapted into a game? We’d love to hear from you.</p></blockquote><p>Visit the Big Fan Games official website <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The book is full of tales and secrets from the history of the game studio, including insights into cancelled games, conflicts between key leaders, and the impact of Bobby Kotick's drive to control the studio's output through Activision Blizzard.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Readers most concerned with the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-settles-california-discrimination-suit-for-54-million">recently-settled lawsuit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> filed by the State of California over an alleged culture of sexual harassment, toxicity, and abuse won't find many new revelations here—the book doesn't quite answer the question "who knew what, and when?" that has lingered over allegations against the company. But it does explore how that culture came to be, and what factors kept the company from improving it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first warning sign appears on page 14, when describing design meetings at Silicon &amp; Synapse, the company first founded by Mike Morhaime and Frank Pearce in 1991 that would later take on the Blizzard moniker. "All of Silicon &amp; Synapse's employees were men, and these design meetings, fueled by caffeine and testosterone, could get rowdy. Sometimes there was screaming; sometimes there were fistfights," writes Schreier.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/q-a-with-blizzard-leadership-on-return-to-office-bonuses-leaves-devs-fuming" target="_self">Q&amp;A with Blizzard leadership on return-to-office, bonuses leaves devs fuming</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was called "management by chaos," and over time, with the added pressures of alcohol, the difficulty of game development, and the explosive success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it became a fire that couldn't be put out.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Chaotic work environments aren't caused by any one person">Chaotic work environments aren't caused by any one person</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It seems that creative leaders that delivered success on one game by the seat of their pants were trusted to recreate the magic on follow-up titles—but that trust created excess pressure and created leeway for inappropriate behavior.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anecdotes about veteran developers Chris Metzen, David Brevik, and Rob Pardo across the company's history include a drunken brawl that led to a door being torn down, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima Online</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sessions that slowed down work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Diablo II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and meetings that devolved into shouting matches.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One developer on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> told Schreier that developers would "just sit there for a full hour and watch Metzen and Pardo argue."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Metzen would say it should be pink. Pardo would instantly say it should be blue, and only an idiot would make it pink," they said. "It was painful to watch."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This style of leadership finally crashed into a wall during the development of the cancelled MMORPG and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overwatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> predecessor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Titan</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Metzen and Pardo apparently weren't as vocal in their disagreements during this project, but their conflicting ideas left developers spinning in circles, unsure of which boss they were answering to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This overvalued trust in talented individuals led to the company allegedly looking the other way when warned about the behavior of employees like former </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Alexander Afrasiabi.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another key issue in Blizzard's history is pay. Among the allegations against the studio were that the company underpaid female employees compared to their male counterparts. The company's settlements with the State of California and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/activision-blizzard-pledges-18m-to-settle-eeoc-harassment-and-discrimination-lawsuit">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> admitted no wrongdoing, but still created funds for current and former employees to access as compensation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, Schreier's book documents fights over pay that go back to the studio's early days. The first instance of employees not feeling fairly compensated for their hard work apparently happened after the company was sold to Davidson &amp; Associates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Former employee Pat Wyatt explained to Schreier that he and other employees were furious at being denied equity in Silicon &amp; Synapse before the sale, and though the transaction provided better compensation for workers, he was so angry he threatened to quit (the stock he was offered tanked in value after a later parent company, Cendant, was investigated by the SEC for fraudulent accounting practices).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Blizzard would later become well-known for its profit-sharing scheme for employees (a major point of contention between Morhaime and Kotick), but the path to that plan was full of speedbumps for underpaid developers. In 1998, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Starcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developers were told they wouldn't receive their expected bonuses because the game shipped late. In 2005, developers received bonus checks as low as $2,000 after launching </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and some left to form Carbine Studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This incident led Blizzard leadership to convince then-parent company Vivendi to let it implement the more well-known profit-sharing process.</span></p><p>Photo by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, this scheme compensated employees who take relatively lower salaries at Blizzard, since the company's success will drive paychecks at the end of the year. But in 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/q-a-with-blizzard-leadership-on-return-to-office-bonuses-leaves-devs-fuming">Blizzard revamped the system</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> again to prioritize employees on top-earning games, at the expense of their coworkers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the company couldn't square salaries that fairly compensated all employees, it's unsurprising it might find itself unfairly compensating women among its ranks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The glue that bound many of these problems together was the intense crunch, as long work hours were a constant at the company from day one. Blizzard employees coped with the long hours by bonding over alcohol and turning the office into a second home, creating the foundations of an in-group that could be hostile to outsiders. Andy Weir, author of The Martian, allegedly faced retaliation from his peers for protesting long hours during a brief stint at Blizzard as a software engineer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building life around the office meant workers began dating their colleagues, and an "incestuous" culture of office romances took hold. Though not all relationships were destined to fail or inappropriate, the idea of Blizzard's campus being a dating pool gave plenty of workers tacit permission to sexually harass colleagues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any of these issues could have been addressed earlier—but the company was producing hits in an unpredictable market. If it wasn't broken, why fix it?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game developers can learn from Blizzard's struggles">Game developers can learn from Blizzard's struggles</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These are admittedly the darker and more frustrating anecdotes to be found in Play Nice, which also celebrates major wins like pivot to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Overwatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and shares major game development lessons from names like Second Dinner chief development officer Ben Brode.

            <p>Tango Gameworks had a six-month old build of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> sequel when the studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">acquired by Krafton back in August</a>.</p>
<p>The studio would also like to bring the game to more platforms and plans for the sequel to have a more open and dynamic environment.</p>
<p>Krafton acquired Tango Gameworks after the studio was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed by Microsoft earlier this year</a>. Not all staff have transferred over as some had already found new jobs, but Krafton estimates Tango will be back up to around 90 to 100 staff by the end of the year.</p>

</figure>
<p>The success of Hi-Fi Rush was a major factor in Krafton's decision to acquire the studio.</p>
<p>"I think that gave us confidence because the studio is not relying on the creativity of just Shinji Mikami," Krafton head of corporate development Maria Park told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "New creatives are coming from younger developers and they were very successful in delivering something so unique.</p>
<p>"We could tell that this is a studio capable of creating the full spectrum of different experiences. They have a couple of new projects in production, we looked at them, [and] they were very different from the previous titles."</p>
<p>As for bringing Hi-Fi Rush to further platforms, such as Nintendo Switch, that's "what the team really wants," said Park. "I think [they] want to work on Hi-Fi Rush DLC [too] because they are dedicated to ensuring that Hi-Fi Rush 2 upholds high standards of quality. They don't want to rush the sequel but take the necessary time to refine the game and come up with a different experience."</p>
<p>When Krafton first met with Tango Gameworks to discuss an acquisition, the build for the sequel was about six months old, though development has been on hold as the IP acquisition from Microsoft to Krafton is still underway.</p>
<p>"Yes, the team was working on Hi-Fi Rush 2 when we first met them," said Park. "They want to make sure [it] surpasses the expectations of the existing fans. For instance, some of the feedback about Hi-Fi Rush was that some people felt it was [just] going through factories, so now they want to give a more open world type of experience. I don't think it's going to be completely open world, but a more dynamic environment [that] you play in. Also, having more advanced technology applied to the rhythm action so that it feels more synchronised."</p>
<p>Park also confirmed Tango's other IP - Ghostwire: Tokyo and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> - will stay with Microsoft and are not part of Krafton's acquisition.</p>
<p>In a previous interview, Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-acquired-tango-gameworks-to-maintain-its-legacy-rather-than-cash-in">aim of the acquisition was to "maintain their legacy"</a> and admitted he doesn't expect Hi-Fi Rush 2 to "make us money".</p>
<p>"The big hit shouldn't be your goal," said Kim. "If you think about it that way, Hi-Fi Rush might have brought in a little bit of a minus in terms of the financials, but it's a team that should be encouraged to create something new and continue their journey. We want to have more teams like that under our umbrella."</p>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush received critical acclaim, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Eurogamer's review</a> describing it as "vibrant and self-assured".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-2-is-coming-in-2026-new-details-revealed.997308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the highly anticipated sequel to the game released in 2023, is set to arrive in 2026. The team at Hexworks aims to create a sequel incorporating more commercial elements, particularly in visual design, to attract a broader audience of players.</p>



<p>According to the latest <a href="https://cigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CI-Games-Strategy-Update-and-Product-Roadmap-2025-2028.pdf">strategy report from CI Games</a>, the game’s publisher, <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong> is being developed using Unreal Engine 5, with an official reveal planned for 2025 alongside a “strong marketing campaign”. However, it’s important to note that these timelines are internal goals and may change as development progresses.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>One of the key objectives outlined in the report is to enhance the game’s accessibility, thereby drawing in a larger fan base for the game. Hexworks plans to achieve this by introducing additional game modes and implementing various gameplay improvements. One of the features it will include is a full ‘shared progression’ while playing in co-op alongside a core single-player campaign.</p>



<p>Another major detail revealed is regarding an exclusivity deal with Epic Games. <strong>The game will be an Epic Store exclusive</strong> on PC. </p>



<p>Having played both the original and the reboot of <strong>Lords of the Fallen</strong>, I believe the franchise holds significant potential. It could effectively fill the gap left by the absence of the <strong>Dark Souls</strong> series. In my opinion, the main challenge of the reboot was its excessive complexity, stemming from the existence of two separate “worlds.”</p>



<p>The studio could have revitalized the IP by taking a more direct approach, leaving the dual-world concept for a sequel when they had a bigger team and budget. Another aspect worth noting is that the sequel is expected to operate with a larger budget, as the report indicates.</p>



<p>Considering all the information provided, it seems promising that <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong> is on track to exceed the sales of the first game, which recorded 1.3 million units sold according to the CI Games document.</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-lords-of-the-fallen-2-the-future-of-ci-games"><strong>Beyond Lords of the Fallen 2: The Future of CI Games</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the publisher has apointed two other primary projects: <strong>Project SGW</strong>, a new installment in the <strong>Sniper Ghost Warrior</strong> series developed using Unreal Engine 5, and <strong>Project H</strong>, an exciting new fantasy RPG.</p>



<p>CI Games has also outlined three secondary paths for the company:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>United Label</strong>: The “indie” label plans to release between two to three games annually. Recently, they launched&nbsp;<strong>Beyond Galaxyland</strong> and are gearing up for the highly anticipated&nbsp;<strong>Tails of Iron 2</strong>, scheduled for release in February 2025. Furthermore, the label has confirmed a contract for&nbsp;<strong>Tails of Iron 3</strong>.</li>



<li>Project Scorpio: New tactical shooter IP with PvE focus made in Unreal Engine 5</li>



<li>Project Survive: New survival IP made in Unreal Engine 5</li>
</ol>



<p>As CI Games expands its portfolio, it looks to capitalize on a diverse array of genres, promising an exciting future for fans of the company’s games.</p>

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was very supportive of Krafton's bid to save Tango and acquire the Hi-Fi Rush franchise, which should ensure that the sequel will come to fruition. During the interview, Krafton also said that there are more than the previously reported 50 employees of Tango who came back to the revived studio.</p><p>"When we started talking, there were about 90; among them, a few had already found new jobs," recalled Park. "There's going to be around 70 to 80 joining us. We're also going to backfill some of the positions that are immediately in need.

Step into the parkour-driven, zombie-riddled open worlds of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and you'll be hit by a flood of sidequests and extra challenges that add heft to a pair of already-lengthy campaigns. With over 30 million copies of both games sold, you'd be forgiven for thinking the completion rate for the pair is somewhat low.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it's not. In 2019 franchise director Tymon Smektala </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/building-interesting-emergence-in-i-dying-light-2-i-">told Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that about 50 percent of players had completed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, though that number apparently dipped with the sequel. In a conversation with Game developer at Gamescom 2024, he told us that the completion rate for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was about 10 percent smaller. He said both numbers are "higher than the industry average."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those are all respectable numbers, especially when the completion rates for single player games (and especially open-world ones) can run as low as 20 percent. Still, Smektala seemed perturbed by the dip, especially with the team now working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light: The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a smaller standalone game spun off from an abandoned downloadable expansion that was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc">leaked to the public</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Imagine that you work on the grand finale for your game and only half your players see it," he said. "It's especially important for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where we cap a lot of threads from the history of the series."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/deep-dive-harnessing-the-power-of-player-feedback-with-dying-light-2" target="_self">Deep Dive: Harnessing the power of player feedback with Dying Light 2</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As he and art director Katarzyna Tarnacka told Game Developer, the team want to push that number back up with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a goal that spotlights the challenge of making smaller, faster games with triple-A tech and timelines.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dying Light: The Beast"><span>Dying Light: The Beast</span> is on track to ship in under 3 years</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an era where ballooning development timelines are cranking up budgets and demanding a need for higher and higher sales, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> acts as an interesting experiment. It's a smaller—but still hefty—game built on its predecessor's tech, with some minor advancements that take advantage of a new console generation (it'll also ship on last-gen consoles to honor previous promises of making all </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> DLC available to all players), a minor technical miracle in itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But can a smaller game still hit the sales goals that justify its production? Smektala thinks so—though the game's length will be critical to determining that. "We have to definitely hit a sweet spot between this thing being too short—something you might avoid—and something that's so big you don't have time to finish it," he said. "We want this game to be finished by everyone that plays it because it really answers a lot of questions, and we really believe in the narrative that we have there."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That narrative is built around </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> protagonist "Kyle," played by Roger Craig Smith, who's returning to the role after 10 years away from Techland. Smith and Kyle are apparently a huge draw for Dying Light fans, as the actor told us he was watching reactions on social media and in live chats during the Gamescom opening night awards, and was blown away by the enthusiasm for his return.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kyle's return moves the series out of the walled cities and into a wooded environment, where players will spend more time surrounded by nature than run-down buildings. Players gain the ability to unleash "The Beast" and transform into a beefy zombie that can rampage through foes (though another Beastlike creature apparently stalks the woods...)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bringing the setting to a Twin Peaks-inspired forest (Smektala's words) gave the art and design teams more freedom than they had under the previously planned DLC. Tarnacka explained that she and her colleagues had been holding back "a lot of great ideas" due to the constraints of the smaller project.

"The producer's job isn't to [make] the best game, it's to deliver that part of the game on time," he said.

He said he's interested in tools that help developers and actors work more efficiently, but there's a "spark" that he thinks makes characters like Kyle stick with players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI isn't the only thing that can threaten that spark—Smith said returning to work with Techland to voice the same character 10 years later is a rare experience.

            <p>
Microsoft has announced the next roster of titles set to join Xbox Game Pass in October. (Can you believe it's October already? No, me neither.)
</p>
<p>
Headlining this month's first crop of additions is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, the kung fu combat action game that we dubbed as "elegant" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">Eurogamer's Sifu review</a>.
</p>
<p>
The full list of Xbox Game Pass titles for October 2024 is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (console) - 2nd October</li>
<li>Open Roads (console) - 2nd October</li>
<li>Sifu (cloud, console and PC) - 2nd October</li>
<li>Mad Streets (cloud, console and PC) - 7th October</li>
<li>Inscryption (cloud, console and PC) - 10th October</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a> is a card-based deckbuilding puzzle and horror roguelike that's not to be missed as the nights draw in. We  awarded it top marks and dubbed it a "bold, stand-out, knockout" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inscryption-review-a-wonderful-nightmare-and-a-vividly-memorable-game-of-cards">Eurogamer's Inscryption review</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-roads-review-a-pleasant-road-trip-that-doesnt-go-anywhere-particularly-memorable">Open Roads is a fun if not fully memorable narrative road trip adventure</a> published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Baseball series MLB The Show, meanwhile, is notable as being one of the few games from a PlayStation studio available on Xbox.
</p>
<p>
And finally, as Microsoft giveth, so it also taketh away. These five titles will be departing Xbox Game Pass on 15th October, so play them while you can:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Dyson Sphere Program (PC)</li>
<li>Everspace 2 (cloud, console and PC)</li>
<li>From Space (cloud, console and PC)</li>
<li>F1 Manager 2023 (cloud, console and PC)</li>
<li>Scorn (cloud, console and PC)</li>
</ul>
