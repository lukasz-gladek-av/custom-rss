			<p>During Kai's trip to San Francisco to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, he was able to secure <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive interview</a> with BioWare's Francois Chaput (Missions and Level Design Director) and Matt Rhodes (Art Director). Later, though, he also participated in a roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Directors Corinne Busche and John Epler where various colleagues from the press were able to ask their questions.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting answers came on the topic of companions, which are the very focus of Dragon Age: The Veilguard and even prompted <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the title change from Dreadwolf</a>. When asked when they decided companions wouldn't be directly controllable (unlike previous installments), they said:</p>
<p><em><strong>Corinne Busche:</strong> I think I can start this one and then maybe John if you want to jump in. Dragon Age has such an amazing, rich lore and history behind it. The worldbuilding, I really think it's what's kept this franchise alive and people discussing it 10 years after Inquisition. So our North Star was that we wanted you to embody Rook, to step into Rook's shoes, to experience this world on the ground as this character. And what that meant is giving you more autonomy, more control of the character, putting you in control of every single swing, and really making it feel like you're a part of this world.</em></p>
<p><em>What's more, we've talked a lot about the companions. I know a lot of the questions that came up today about Dragon Age: The Veilguard were about the depth and authenticity of the companions. We really felt like there was a big opportunity here to make the companions feel more realized, more like their characters who fight alongside you and have their own styles, motivations, and interactions if you're not actually embodying them.</em></p>
<p><em>But of course, throughout all of that, we do know in the combat system, that sense of teamwork, of pause and play, tactical depth. That has been the throughline through every single edition of Dragon Age. So we wanted to walk the fine line of making that teamwork and that sense of strategy show up but also make you feel like you're in this world.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>John Epler:</strong> Yeah, and Corinne touched on autonomy as far as Rook goes, but also part of making the companions feel like their own people, like their own characters, is giving them that autonomy as well on the battlefield. Again, you are the leader of this group. They have their own personalities and their own stories, and we wanted to make sure that you felt that through the gameplay as well.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time BioWare has talked about companions being '<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-the-most-complex-fully-realized-companions-weve-ever-crafted-says-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully realized</a>', though it is the first time they've linked that to the decision to remove direct player control of the party, which remains controversial for some fans.</p>
<p>We won't have too much to wait until we can play Dragon Age: The Veilguard for ourselves and decide whether it was the right choice. In the meantime, stay tuned for the full transcript of the roundtable Q&amp;A.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>BioWare and Electronic Arts recently invited a select number of media and influencers, Wccftech included, to their western California campus to get some of the first hands-on with their long-awaited sequel to the Dragon Age franchise. It’s been a long time coming and a series of iterations to get to where we are now and with the release only a handful of weeks away, gamers will finally have the opportunity to take up the mantle of The Veilguard.</span></p>
<p><span>Built upon the narrative started nearly two decades ago and touched on as recently as Dragon Age: Inquisition’s DLC, Dragon Age: The Veilguard starts with a daemon attack upon Tevinter and the swift introduction to the player’s chosen Rook and only a small selection of the Veil jumpers that will form the basis for the player’s faction of interlopers this time around: the Veil Jumpers. Varric and Bianca also make their presence known early on, but this time around, the plucky thief is more content with taking a more passive role along this adventure.</span></p>
<p><span>This opening act was the very same that’s been present from the very <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first</a> gameplay footage shown to the world of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. From character creation up through that fateful encounter with Solas (which for many players may indeed be the first time that they’ve met face to face if coming in having skipped Dragon Age: Inquisition), I got to see firsthand the carnage that attempting to tear open the Veil might cause despite some good intentions behind the act.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-Dreadwolf-Screenshot-Bellara.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Bioware has invested a great amount of time into the character creation suite of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The Keep has sadly been left behind in an earlier console generation and, with it, a way to carry forward the status of Thedas and choices made prior. BioWare remedied this to a lesser extent by permitting the player to make a few key observations about the state of the world but this is a feature that they intend to keep under wraps until much closer to release. For the player's own iteration of the Rook, players can change everything from the body type and pronouns down to freckles and hair growth. A player could easily spend a solid hour trying to come up with the perfect character, only to change their minds midway through the adventure. To remedy this, there is a magic mirror inside the main base of operations that serves as aesthetician and barber all in one.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the roughly six hours of playable gameplay to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, we had to jump about within the narrative to experience a variety of the story without taking part in one solid block of time. Following the initial reveal of Solas and his end goals, the story then jumps forward to a bit of time later on in the first act as players have already formed up a minor resistance band known as the Veil Jumpers. This dysfunctional troupe of heroes and anti-heroes are united together to follow a path first laid out by the Dreadwolf and Elven god himself.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard-Champion-Skill-Tree.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>In these early formative quests of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, a majority of the cast has already been assembled for those common goals. Progressing the narrative will not always be a straight line. Side quests routinely break up the pacing of the story without feeling rushed to save the world, even if there should be a proper sense of urgency in the battle of gods. Many of these sidequests were locked out from accessing during the preview as EA instead wished for players to continue on a familiar path across all early players. There is a fair bit of exploration available to the player in The Crossroads, another familiar locale for Dragon Age veterans, but the kiddie rails were left on to prevent any one of us from delving into uncharted spoiler territory.</span></p>
<p><span>The primary choice offered to me was in regards to bringing the Veil Jumpers to one of two catastrophic events to protect and resolve. For me, the obvious choice was to track down a blood mage and put them down; from taking a moment to peek at the neighbors around me during the preview session, this appeared to be the less popular option. While I was a veritable powerhouse with a two-handed hammer for much of the quest, facing the mage while she was bathing in an infinite pool of blood slowed down to a halt. No longer was I cracking kneecaps and hurling shields for kills in one or two hits. </span></p>
<p><span>Instead, this boss fight was an exercise in tedium as the fight itself lasted close to ten minutes of constant attacks, darting behind pillars to avoid bloodborne missiles and smacking the occasional zombie minion to recharge my champion’s ultimate ability only to repeat over and over. Presumably, there was some key conversation or dropped lore entry that might have yielded a weakness I could have exploited early on in the fight, but I was unsuccessful in locating it during my demo session.</span></p>

<p>Any fears that Dragon Age: The Veilguard may be watered down in its combat were quickly washed away as I settled into the roles of Mage and later Warrior. Each class offered at least two different distinct playstyles depending on the primary and secondary weapons along with a relatively small list of equipable actions that almost all ran either on some sort of timer or required some energy to charge up in the case of Rook's ultimate attacks. The combat itself sits somewhere between Dragon Age II's action combat and a character action game. Dodges and evasive maneuvers are critical in combat with only a few healing options available to the character (players can bring three health potions at a time into battle, although I did find a piece of gear later on that would expand that with an additional potion slot) and only a very few actual healing spells across all of the various classes and specializations.</p>
<p>Assuming direct control of the Rook's party members is a thing of the past in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, with the crew actually playing relatively smart and synergizing automatically with the player's given playstyle with their own abilities. There is still a pause menu where players can issue specific commands and utilize combo attacks under the right conditions, but players will spend most of the time in combat assuming control of Rook to slash, cast, and roll their way through hordes of enemies. It's a change that will take some getting used to but I've rather enjoyed the evolution to role-playing combat that BioWare has devised in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><span>In the years since Dragon Age: Inquisition graced our Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s, BioWare has become master craftspeople with their facial capture technology. Far more impressive than the exotic landscapes and gruesome evil monsters are the fine touches they’ve put into every little thing for the Rook and their various party members, from gentle smirks to glorious shouts. This is one title I’ll have to look forward to playing on PC or the newly announced PlayStation 5 Pro at the very least.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s rather fitting that players will have had to wait roughly the same amount of time since Dragon Age 4’s initial reveal between the canon events of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Trespasser leading Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but that wait will be over soon. Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be available across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC on October 31st, 2024. PC players with an active EA Play Pro subscription will also be able to journey through Thedas the very same day.</span></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-a-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds.985734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is a massive game and step forward for the series. Its design is thoughtful, the moment to moment gameplay exhilarating, and full of spectacle around every corner. For many, this will not only be a return to form for BioWare but a level up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before going further, check out the above video to see much of what I’m discussing here in-motion and a bunch of other features like the character creator, views of the class skill trees, the companion skill trees, and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of describing combat to you, we have a few videos showing off different levels of <em>Veilguard</em>’s gameplay. We have one focused on the <a href="https://youtu.be/NwxJf2_uVu0">Warrior class showing early combat</a>, one on the <a href="https://youtu.be/oqorhe8uT-M">Mage class showing a more intermediate look at combat</a>, and then we have <a href="https://youtu.be/Flt6JRXJBcY">a video on Rogue combat</a> that shows what a well-crafted higher character can do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all, there’s about an hour’s worth of footage to take in if you want to see what <em>Veilguard </em>is all about.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I write this, I am keeping in mind my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion">interview with Game Director Corinne Busche</a>. In that interview, we discuss the design philosophy behind how they handle player choice and just how much it permeates the entire game. BioWare’s approach really shows up in every aspect of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to read that interview as a companion piece to this, as it talks a lot more about important player choices, dialogue choices, and relationships with companions. The amount of effectual choices you can make is truly impressive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as the choices you make in the story and the relationships you’ll make in the game are vast and varied, so too are the options for you to play the game just as you want. Your toolbox when it comes to combat is humongous.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard’s Skill Trees Encourage Experimentation&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The skill trees for the various classes have a staggering amount of variety and nuance to them. &nbsp;Each tree has a few defined paths to specializations, which in themselves are great, but there’s a lot of things on the margins for you to take in as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to note is that <em>Veilguard </em>has a level cap of 50, and while I haven’t counted them, there’s definitely well over 100 nodes in the skill tree to make your build. So, there’s a lot of freedom to do what you want with a build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it also means is that the trees were designed with the knowledge that you won’t be able to fill out even most of it, so they are filled with a bunch of strategic decisions to build something unique to your playstyle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In just the Warrior alone, you can build something around parrying, around shield throwing, around two handed weapons, a lifestealing build, and man so much more. I wish I had studied the trees a little closer as there’s so much there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, the developers said at the preview event I attended that the finetuning of the trees has been a big focus of <em>Veilguard</em>’s development with the hope that people can outsmart the developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, they mentioned that someone playtesting the game was able to make a shield-throwing Warrior build that could more or less one shot bosses. That of course needed to be tuned down some, but they’re excited at the prospect of what people will be able to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with my limited time messing with it, I can already see that a popular post in Dragon Age communities and social media &nbsp;will be showing off crazy builds and the combos you can pull off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best part of the skill tree is the fact you can redo it whenever you want. There is no limit on respeccing what you want, so you can fine tune between encounters if you want or just change something completely.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Gear is More than Just Numbers&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Adding a layer on top of that is the gear you’ll equip. There are a lot of different status effects and attributes that can affect the damage you do. Focus on breaking down shields, barriers, holding people in place, staggering – there are stats for all of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gear isn’t simply just a “bigger number is better” approach, either. Pieces of armor or a weapon can be dramatically different from one another, and I can foresee a possibility where you find something so sick you change your build to make use of its stats and abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Runes are another piece of gear you get access to that add a lot of versatility. You can equip up to three and each come with some sort of active ability and stat boost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, one might just give you a straight 10% bonus to cold damage and then have an active ability that increases your ability damage by 20% for a certain time period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the three runic abilities will be available to you in combat, too. You can cycle through their use as another active ability to use.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companions are Key to an Optimum Build, Too&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One final wrinkle to consider when trying to make the most optimum build you can are your companions. Like your player character, companions have fairly expansive skill trees and even gear to equip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you venture out with your two companions, you can equip them with three abilities each. Each companion has five different abilities to choose from, each of which have their own upgrade path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, the skill trees are no where as huge as the player character’s, but you can change up what sort of effectiveness an ability has pretty significantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, in that screenshot above Davrin has the ability Death From Above. That’s something he can call down from the sky to cause a small explosion, damage, and stagger some enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one upgrade path, you can go full bore and try to make Death from Above the most devastating AoE attack you can. In the other, it will buff your companions and yourself in various ways at the same time becoming a pseudo-support ability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some abilities go from causing huge types of certain kinds of damage to trying to control the field more, like slowing or freezing enemies in place. Or maybe you’re wanting someone to heal, to keep enemies at a distance, or just try to blow up as much as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those are all viable options that you can use to complement your playstyle. With a Mage or even a Rogue focusing on the bow, some companions may be more helpful in controlling the field by allowing you to keep your distance and stay in range. Or maybe they can group enemies up while another companion sticks them in place for you to deliver some powerful blow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a lot of choices you can make in not only the party make up but the individual choices for your companions, which can empower you’re preferred playstyle a great amount.</p>

<p>Synergy is the word the developers use with your companions, and there is certainly a lot to be found. Not only in just the straight utility of the abilities, but there are some abilities companions or player characters can use simultaneously for a big bonus in damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The amount of player choice you have in how you want to play is truly astonishing and like nothing I’ve seen in an action RPG of this type before. It’s not only the choices you can make but just how obviously effective they are. It’s not simple stat increases here and there but huge shake ups that dramatically effect how you can play the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said before, BioWare told us at the preview event that they can’t wait to see how players outsmart the development team with the incredible tools they’re putting in our hands.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Isn’t Open World But Still Feels Huge&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I don’t know about you, but the open world formula has been pretty tiresome in so many games for so long. Too often great ideas and great games are bogged down by open world bloat and “activities” littered on a map just for something to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> gives you the best of both worlds in terms of having plenty of exploration with hand-crafted gameplay experiences. At no time in my near 7 hours of playing the game did it feel claustrophobic or that I wasn’t immersed in some massive well-realized world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Veilguard </em>is mission-based, so you’ll gather up some companions and venture out to complete some quest, or more than one, in a specific area of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shedding the weight of designing an effective open world lets <em>Veilguard</em> really shine. Each of the missions I completed were full of awesome spectacle, a cool set piece, or some exquisite arena in which to fight a boss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those epic crescendo moments saved for big climaxes in games feel like they’re around every corner in <em>Veilguard</em>. I was constantly delighted and taken aback by the amazing imagery and emotion these hugely dramatic moments constantly portrayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best moments of so many games are not remembered from how you got from point a to point b but what you actually did when you got there. Those fine-tuned gameplay sequences that really show a game at its best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More or less, that’s basically what <em>Veilguard </em>is. The prologue kicks you off in what the developers wanted to feel like was the final mission of a game, a big story concluding moment to set the stage. From that point on, Veilguard never really lets go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, I can’t imagine the whole game is as crazy cool at that rate it was in my preview. The snippets of gameplay the chose to show were put there for a reason, after all. Regardless, I think there’s a lot to look forward to.</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think that <em>Veilguard </em>is just high-octane action all the time, as BioWare has a reputation for crafting some good stories – particularly in telling stories about the companions you gather along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those intimate character moments are still there. Between missions you’ll be at your base of operations, The Lighthouse, where everyone can kind of chill and collect their thoughts. You’ll have the opportunity to talk with and learn a ton more about the companions and the world at large there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of them are well-realized with well-defined personalities, beliefs, desires, goals, and everything else that goes into a great character. It is learning who these folks are that we really get to start putting the rest of the world-threatening plot into perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Crossroads Will Satisfy Your Exploration Urges&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The Lighthouse is a sanctuary within the Veil for your party to hangout, but you’ll quickly get access to another part of the Veil for travel: The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Crossroads is a place in-between in the Veil that allows for quick travel all around the world. It is an expansive set of ruins, structures, dungeons, and more just waiting to be discovered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can engage with The Crossroads as much or as little as you want. Once you’ve made y our way to the major fast travel point to get you to somewhere in the world, you don’t have to do much in The Crossroads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is a lot of story and sidequesting to be done there. It’s full of open world puzzling, random events, and quests to stumble upon. For example, in one I stumbled into an old memory of Solas’ past, getting to experience it firsthand while delving a dungeon.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> feels like <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s cousin. I know how insane that sentence sounds, particularly with BioWare’s history in the <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both are RPGs with incredible tools for player agency with actual game changing consequences. Both focus heavily on deep connective stories with companions and party members. Both let you get as crazy as you want with their respective combat systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, both in terms of design philosophy and quality, I think <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is to action RPGs what <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> is to CRPGs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Might be a little early to say that, as there’s a whole lot of the game I didn’t see, but I don’t think I’ve walked away feeling better about the quality of a game than with <em>Veilguard</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</ul><p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third game in the&nbsp;<em>Two Point&nbsp;</em>series of wacky management sims.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/veilguard-game-director-corinne-busche-on-player-choice-and-companion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>BioWare has a rich history of innovation when it comes to player choice and agency, from the dialogue wheel to the relationships you build with companions. With that in mind, I had a chance to talk with <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> Game Director Corinne Busche about player choice and what it means for your character and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">overview video of everything we learned about </a></em><a href="https://youtu.be/4Ejlg-sn-AU">Dragon Age: The Veilguard </a><em>in our seven hour preview here.</em></p>
<h2>Player Choice in Veilguard Is Intimate&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>There are near endless ways to handle player choice, and I wanted to know what their guiding principles were in <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. Busche had an interesting answer as to their approach: intimacy.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wanted you to feel like you're in this world, that you're more attached and on the ground than perhaps even other entries in the game or in the IP’s history. So with that comes a level of intimacy. So choice and consequence, particularly as it relates to narrative beats, we really lean into what are those things that are going to affect people's lives? &nbsp;... What are those really personal moments where you feel like, if you really care about this character, that you can help them make some of the most important decisions of their lives? ... Our choices, that intimacy and connection, that sense of immersion, is really our North Star.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, and Busche wanted to stress this as well, intimacy doesn’t necessarily mean romantic (don’t worry, it’s BioWare so you’ll have plenty of romance options).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intimacy just means being close, having an understanding. Getting into the nitty gritty of details and information of your own character and those they interact with.</p>

<p>Based on my time with the game and further conversation with Busche, I think that is a great word that shows its influence throughout <em>Veilguard</em>’s design. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Veilguard Companion Relationships Are Impactful and Complex&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Obviously, the relationships you have with characters will be intimate. There is a closeness that will develop from their shared cause of the game, of course, and you have an opportunity to make them more personal if you wish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Companions in <em>Veilguard </em>cast a huge shadow of course, both in how integral they are to the plot and in how they ground the game. They have unique personalities, motivations, and past histories. Naturally, that means you’ll get a wide variety of reactions to the choices you make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to decisions affecting companions:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There will be times where it changes the nature of the dynamic you have with them. There will be times when people need to step away. Another factor is, do you actually help them out with their own personal motivations, and how does that affect how they show up?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on where you or your companions are in the story, they may be off doing their own thing. They have goals, desires, and a whole life outside the main plot of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, maybe you made one angry with a decision but maybe they just have something they needed to do, so off they go. You’ll even have a chance to run into companions going about their business when you’re out exploring as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not all choices are so obviously huge they may send a companion off to take a break or what have you either, as the small choices through dialogue or elsewhere build up to big effects, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Companion Progression in Veilguard&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Building relationships with companions is exactly how you’ll see them progress, with Busche noting that they’ve taken a new approach to companion progression in <em>Veilguard</em>:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So their progression is based on how well you know and understand one another. It's directly tied to your relationship with them. And it's not necessarily how friendly you are with them, it's how well you know each other, how well you know how to work together. So as I bring companions with me on missions, I help solve their problems, that's going to improve that sense of connection, and that's going to make us work better as a team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as gaining XP is fun and all, your companions won’t just level up with the player character at the same rate. Instead, the level of your relationship grows the closer you get to them. That grows through conversation, bringing them on missions, choices, and quests specific to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each companion has a fairly expansive skill tree that you can customize as you wish. Obviously, the lower your relationship with them, the fewer points you’re able to put in their skill tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skill trees aren’t just simple upgrades to stats, like more strength or what have you. Each node on the tree directly affects one ability or another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did ask if there could be situation where a companion would be underpowered if I never used them in <em>Veilguard</em>, but Busche said that while they won’t have quite as much at their disposal, companions will always have an effect. They’ll never be useless.</p>
<p>Growing that relationship level isn't just as simple as spending time with them, either.&nbsp;Each have their own complex histories, preferences, and desires that will inform the way they act and react.</p>
<h2>Companion and Character Histories Matter a Lot&nbsp;</h2>
<p>This philosophy is applied to all your interactions and the reactions you’ll receive from companions and characters along the way. Romance, however, is probably the easiest to see how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you can certainly pursue all of your companions, that doesn’t mean that <em>Veilguard </em>will just let you romance them just for the sake of it. If you do certain things or make certain choices, they just won’t be that interested in you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, as Busche described, companions won’t conform to the player. They won’t just crumple their beliefs and preferences for the sake of letting you romance someone. In other words, it has to make sense.</p>
<p>Outside of even romance, Busche made sure to note that growing these relationships doesn't necessarily mean you'll be friends with all the companions. The shared experience and common cause create an intimacy, but there's a chance your personalities just won't gel. A working relationship you could say.</p>

<p>In the mix of all of this are the choices you made when creating a character and those you continue to make when further defining who your Rook will be in the game. Character creation choices from the race you are to your background, class, and those choices beyond the character creator are just as impactful and intimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Busche gave two examples of these intimate choices. In one, if you’re playing a dwarf, you can have an interesting conversation with Harding early in the game as both your character and her have a dream. Dwarves don’t dream and they’re wondering what the hell is going on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another, Busche described a smaller decision with a less important character having a big impact:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the smaller choices, but one that hit me quite hard, it sits with me, is when you have choices of maybe somebody living or dying, but if I'm a Grey Warden, well I can send them to the order as well and they show up later in the game. And while that might not be a world shaking decision, you really get the sense that, like you're affording a second chance to these characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a ton of opportunities to make <em>Veilguard </em>your own that extend far beyond the choices you make in dialogue, about certain characters, or about deviances in the plot, too.</p>
<h2>Be Who You Want To Be&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Busche said that one of their pillars of design was “Be who you want to be.” That is precisely the experience they want players to have, so you can customize your character in so many ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We break down the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-hands-on-cure-for-tiresome-open-worlds">various systems of<em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> here</a>, but you’ll have the chance to customize your character’s class, skill tree, armor, companion skill trees, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is even an option to customize pretty much every UI element of the game, removing or adding whatever you want. That means that, yes, you could have absolutely nothing on screen if you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To boil it all down, that “be who you want to be” pillar is the goal Busche is trying to achieve in <em>Veilguard</em>. From important companion relationships, to the plot, to character customization, to skills, to gear, and everything in-between, <em>Veilguard </em>is striving to let you play any way you want.&nbsp;</p>

The studio that developed&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">the game at the heart of the suit</a>, issued a statement early this morning saying it doesn’t know what patents it violated. “At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details,” the statement read. </p><p>According to Nintendo’s press release, the reason for the lawsuit has to do with Pocketpair allegedly infringing on multiple as yet undisclosed patents. The details of the lawsuit have not yet been made public, so we do not yet know which patents, and according to Pocketpair’s statement, it doesn’t know, either.</p><p>The news broke last night that Nintendo and TPC were suing the makers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24048972/palworld-news-trailers"><em>Palworld</em></a><em> </em>— an open-world survival crafting game that features a collection of companion monsters players can catch and battle. Since its release in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">the game became an instant hit</a>, racking up over 10 million in copies sold and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24048343/but-for-palworld-it-was-tuesday">breaking Steam concurrent player records</a> within its first few weeks. Almost immediately, people noticed striking similarities between<em> Palworld</em>’s “pals” and pokémon from their looks <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">down to their extraordinarily similar character models</a>.</p><p>Though Nintendo’s not going after Pocketpair because <a href="https://palworld.fandom.com/wiki/Lamball">lamballs</a> look uncomfortably similar to <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/wooloo">wooloos</a>, we do know the company is famously litigious in protecting its brand. Shortly after <em>Palworld</em>’s release, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/23/24047854/nintendo-palworld-pokemon-mod-youtube-dmca">TPC ordered a programmer to take down a video</a> that featured a mod of <em>Palworld</em> that replaced all the pals with pokémon. It also issued a statement <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050320/pokemon-palworld-investigation-copyright-plagiarism">saying it was aware of <em>Palworld</em></a> — although the statement did not refer to the game by name — and would be investigating the game to “take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon.” Looks like the company found something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game stars Rook, a new hero of your own creation, working with beloved characters Varric Tethras and Scout Harding to take down Solas, the elven mage from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> who, it’s revealed in a post-credits scene, is actually an elven god called the Dread Wolf. <em>The Veilguard</em> has its own twists and turns that make even that synopsis merely the tip of the iceberg, but as a starting point, it’s comforting to know we’re heading into the conflict fans have been waiting for.</p><p>But it’s not just the main plot that draws heavily from previous threads. Much of the game takes place in Minrathous, the magical capital city of the Tevinter Imperium where magic reigns over the common man. We’ve heard conflicting accounts about the city, from characters like <em>Inquisition’s</em> mage pariah Dorian Pavus and <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s elven slave Fenris. Now, we’re finally going to what feels like BioWare’s magical take on an oppressive cyberpunk city, where we’ll get to form our own impressions of it and—in classic BioWare fashion—make a difference. I’ve been a mage in all three previous games. I loved a Tevinter slave in <em>DA2 </em>and a man who hoped to change the country in <em>Inquisition</em>. In playing the early hours as my radical mage Rook, it felt like all of my time in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe had been leading to this moment.</p><h2 id="h11925"><a id=""></a><strong><em>The Veilguard </em>feels like the <em>Dragon Age</em> I’ve been waiting for</strong></h2><p>After waiting 10 years and hearing reports of drastic shifts in the project, I was naturally concerned about whether we’d get a satisfactory continuation of Solas’ story. According to creative director John Epler, abandoning that plot thread was never in the cards, even as the game that would become <em>The Veilguard</em> went through its multiple iterations.</p><p>“At every iteration of this game, it was gonna be the hunt for Solas,” Epler told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We ended <em>Trespasser</em> with a dagger in the map on Tevinter. Those were kind of the core of [the story]. We knew we wanted to go to Northern Thedas and part of that was just we wanted to try something new, go somewhere new. And I mean, for me, Tevinter has always been this place we’ve said so much about, but we’ve never been able to show it before. So it was always like we need to go there. That makes the most sense. And then for Solas, obviously, at the end of <em>Inquisition,</em> he revealed himself as the Dread Wolf. At the end of <em>Trespasser</em>, we revealed his plan. Those two have always been a part of this game no matter what, it was always going to be about Solas to some degree and it was always going to be at least partially in Tevinter.”</p><figure id="" data-id="495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-recommend-id="image://495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-format="gif" data-width="628" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-recommend-id="image://495ea17be181c81f6552c0e510b143ea" data-format="gif" data-width="628" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook opens a door and views the rest of The Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Tevinter and the city of Minrathous have been central to everything we’ve seen of <em>The Veilguard</em> so far, the game broadly takes place in northern Thedas, using the series’ portal-like Eluvian network to let players bounce around other distinct locations like the countries of Antiva and Rivain, which have also been spoken about in previous games but never fully explored. However, one of the ways BioWare seems to have been more measured and played to its own skill set is that <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t echo <em>Inquisition</em>’s open-zone structure. Nor is it quite <em>Dragon Age II</em>, which all took place in one concentrated area. Instead, what I played felt more structured like a <em>Mass Effect </em>game, utilizing bespoke missions and environments that tell contained stories that flow back into the main one.<br></p><p>One of the best examples was the recruitment mission for Lucanis Dellamorte, the Antivan assassin found in an underwater prison. Not part of one of the cities I’d already seen, it was a sequestered area that didn’t feel like it was caving under the scale of an open-world structure. <em>The Veilguard </em>has smaller environments that are densely packed with things to care about, rather than a lot of empty space for you to ride through on horseback while trying to get to the shit that matters. It feels like BioWare is working with a reasonable scale to cater to its strengths. After wasting hours of my life moving through <em>Inquisition</em>’s Hinterlands forests or <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s harsh Elaaden deserts, I can’t begin to describe how refreshing it was to just get to the heart of what I came here for with ease.</p><figure id="" data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-recommend-id="image://18ec2b5ac4e74c77971f0b5a35feac53" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Dragon Age: The Veilguard faction menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The action-based combat, meanwhile, feels more comparable to that of <em>Mass Effect </em>than <em>Dragon Age</em>, for better or worse. You have two companions rather than the previous three, and unlike in previous games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">you can’t swap control to them</a></span> to change up how you play. This is certainly a change that’s hard to swallow for long-time fans, and when I heard this news, I was concerned about what we’d gain in this trade-off. But as it turns out, I never encountered an enemy or situation that merited switching off my Rook to play as Harding, the ice mage Neve, or any of the other companions I fought alongside in my seven hours of play.</p><p>In a vacuum, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels like an exceptionally solid action RPG, but it’s not designed to feel evocative of previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games, and I know that will rub some the wrong way. However, I don’t feel like I’ve lost anything in not being able to swap to companions, because the game seems thoughtfully designed so that you’ll never need to. Here, your teammates act more or less as cooldown machines, dropping in their own abilities at your command and helping you execute combos. They’re here to support you, rather than offering skill sets you’ll want or need to deploy yourself. There’s an enjoyable synergy to the teamwork that comes from moments like using my Ultimate ability to gather enemies together in a black hole while ordering Neve to freeze all of them in place with an ice spell. It doesn’t feel quite like <em>Dragon Age </em>as we know it, but it still feels <em>really</em> good to set up combos alongside your team. But <em>The Veilguard </em>also probably makes me feel the most independent I’ve ever felt in fights in <em>Dragon Age</em>, and that’s coming from a career mage player.<br></p><p>Every class in <em>The Veilguard </em>feels more versatile than it has in the past, in keeping with the baseline action combat BioWare has designed. Whether you’re a warrior, mage, or rogue, you get two weapon sets that you can switch between on the fly. Warriors can use a standard “sword and board” build or change to dual-wielding axes. Rogues can go back and forth between dual daggers or a bow. Mages, however, sported the most interesting kit I saw during the preview. My Rook started with a staff that felt like <em>The Veilguard</em>’s version of the previous games’ long-range mage builds. But I was also able to swap to a dagger-and-orb build that let me fight at mid-range with a magical sphere I was able to throw back and forth to keep enemies at a comfortable distance. Then, if they got too close, I still had my dagger in hand.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-recommend-id="image://ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-format="gif" data-width="441" data-height="296" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-recommend-id="image://ed31f990fc241c8956264947330544a0" data-format="gif" data-width="441" data-height="296" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook uses an orb-and-dagger build to fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Those parallels and the inherent versatility of each class have naturally made some of the more methodical teamplay of previous games slip through the cracks, but BioWare says the rest of the RPG elements are meant to make it more than a hack-and-slash game for those that want to create builds.</p><p>“We’ve always had different combat styles for each <em>Dragon Age</em> game, but the two focuses have always been moment-to-moment gameplay needs to feel fluid and there needs to be that strategic layer,” Epler said. “And I think once you start getting especially into the skill trees, once you start getting into companion abilities, there is still a lot of that strategy in this game. And especially as you get to harder difficulties. You either need to be very, very good at the moment-to-moment gameplay or you need to dive deep into the strategic layer to succeed.”</p><p>While <em>Mass Effect </em>is an easy in-house comparison to make, Epler told me that games like <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>were a big influence on <em>The Veilguard</em>’s world construction, and the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. </em>games were a surprising inspiration for environments like Arlathan Forest as “this weird magical Chernobyl where things have gone wrong.” Of course, BioWare has also been looking at its own history, but the specific game that Epler cited the most from the studio’s own past is a surprisingly divisive one.</p><p>2011’s <em>Dragon Age II</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii-you-know-5875251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/not-everyone-hates-dragon-age-ii-you-know-5875251">one of the most divisive games BioWare’s put out</a></span>. The sequel was notorious for its crunched development, and it shows in its smaller scale and reuse of environmental assets. It has some pretty interesting ideas, though, too; ideas that I can’t help think about as I play <em>The Veilguard</em>. It was more action-oriented, more self-contained, taking place as it did in one city, and it’s the most companion-driven story in the franchise. <em>The Veilguard </em>is unapologetically an action-RPG, stripping away the open-zone structure of <em>Inquisition</em>, and it’s brought back the divisive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">“free-for-all” romance mechanics of <em>DA2</em></a></span>. It even falls back into <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s dialogue system, in which you choose from three distinct “personalities” of nice, sarcastic, and aggressive, complete with the same icons on its dialogue wheel. Given all of this, I can’t help but feel like <em>The Veilguard </em>is a spiritual successor to one of the more controversial games in BioWare’s portfolio. Epler says that each of the past <em>Dragon Age</em> games served as an influence, but <em>DA2 </em>and its party dynamic have been one of the biggest inspirations as the team decided what lessons to take from the sequel’s reception over the years.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-recommend-id="image://cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-format="gif" data-width="627" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-recommend-id="image://cd6f2c23d44807ab137bfbf021d33622" data-format="gif" data-width="627" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks to Harding and Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“I think, for me, it’s a lot of the foundations of [<em>Dragon Age II</em> that influenced the team],” Epler said. “A lot of the ideas behind the characters, especially around the way that the companions were handled and how they felt over the course of the game [as you] built this group that [we looked back on]. There were more interactions between companions than there were in pretty much every other <em>Dragon Age</em> game. <em>DAI</em> had the Wicked Grace game, <em>DAO</em> had back-and-forth between characters at camp, but <em>DA2</em> is the one that really focused on, ‘These are people with their own lives.’”</p><p>For the folks at BioWare, there still seems to be a lot of love for <em>Dragon Age II</em> despite its troubled development and mixed reception. Asked if there was anxiety or concern about drawing on such a divisive game, Epler says that looking back on it for <em>The Veilguard</em> is just about making a judgment call on what was worthwhile to revisit and what shortcomings may have just been a result of the development parameters the team was given.</p><p>“I don’t know if there’s so much anxiety, it’s just something where you want to make sure you’re drawing the right lessons and not drawing the wrong lessons from it. It was at the end of the day, it was a game made in a very short period of time. A lot of that was, I wouldn’t say failures of execution, it was executed as best as it could be, but it could never be necessarily executed better than that.”</p><h2 id="h11926"><a id=""></a><strong>Back to basics</strong></h2><p>Game director Corinne Busche said during a developer Q&amp;A after our demo that <em>Dragon Age</em>’s constant reinvention of itself has been the “greatest challenge” and the “most interesting opportunity” for her, and said picking and choosing what to bring with them from previous games was a key question throughout <em>The Veilguard</em>’s development. Whether it’s small things like Rook’s six possible backgrounds feeling like an homage to the original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> or larger-scale design philosophies like the fast-paced combat of <em>Dragon Age II</em> clearly influencing that of <em>The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“I think I could speak for the entirety of the team that our hope is that this all comes together to respect where we’ve been, but also advance the franchise into this next adventure into Thedas,” Busche said.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-recommend-id="image://bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-recommend-id="image://bc568c82c517fa5e8132acde51156b73" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook talks down a bar full of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From what I played, I believe that it will. I don’t think I would have believed that if <em>The Veilguard </em>had been a live-service multiplayer game. I have spent the past 10 years feeling cynical about <em>Dragon Age</em>, as I long feared it wouldn’t be able to deliver the conclusion I was looking for, and with each passing year my cynicism only grew. 2017’s <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> brought me back home to my favorite world in video games, but was chasing open-world and live-service trends in the margins of what, with proper scaling, could have been a better game. <em>Anthem </em>confirmed my fears that a studio which had created worlds I’d spent thousands of hours in and thousands of hours thinking about had been devoured by the hunt for the next big live-service phenomenon. Now, <em>The Veilguard </em>feels both like a calculated return to familiar territory and a bold declaration of what the studio should have been making these past 10 years. </p><p>It’s a shame it took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-4-bioware-layoffs-1850766754">all this strife to get here</a></span>, but playing those seven hours made me more confident than I’ve felt in years that this team has its head on straight again. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>might not be the game some fans want, but it feels like the game BioWare needs. </p><p><strong>Order <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Age-Veilguard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DCMN43SC/ref=sr_1_2?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0DCMN43SC" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVgRGrbQVc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVgRGrbQVc" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-age-the-veilguard---playstation-5%2F410967.html%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dfeeds%26utm_campaign%3D%2524PLA_%2524NB_MNFR_Video%2520Game%2520Software_Electronic%2520Arts_Preorders%26utm_id%3D16244983656%26gad_source%3D4%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgCloL8XKU85XT7iIahydmSiRcd_4HWnZLqfNTxE516yvYnR6qHEqYZPhoC4pcQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fdragon-age-the-veilguard---playstation-5%2F410967.html%3Futm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dfeeds%26utm_campaign%3D%2524PLA_%2524NB_MNFR_Video%2520Game%2520Software_Electronic%2520Arts_Preorders%26utm_id%3D16244983656%26gad_source%3D4%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjw_ZC2BhAQEiwAXSgCloL8XKU85XT7iIahydmSiRcd_4HWnZLqfNTxE516yvYnR6qHEqYZPhoC4pcQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new special edition consoles will be PlayStation gray, and will be available in the PS5 Digital and PS5 Pro.</p>



<p>In addition to the new consoles, Sony is also releasing a PlayStation gray DualSense controller, PlayStation Portal, and even a PlayStation-style cable connector that looks similar to the original controller connections.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-bioware-finally-nails-the-character-creator-ive-always-wanted<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After ten years, we’re now just a little over a month away from playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard. I played a hefty seven hours of BioWare’s first original game since Anthem in 2019 and fourth mainline installment in the Dragon Age series, starting with the prologue and later loaded into several different saves. As a longtime fan, what I’ll say is ten years is a very long time but so far, The Veilguard hasn’t disappointed.</p><h3>Getting Into Character</h3><p>Now, I could talk to you about the combat (and I will) or the gorgeous locales (that’s coming too) or the way it felt to see Varric  and Solas again. Or I could skip straight to the character creator and start with: There’s. So. Much. Hair. Look, I loved Dragon Age: Inquisition, but fans have long acknowledged the limitations of its character creator. The Veilguard blew me away in that regard. After the lackluster options of the last entry, it’s wild to see what we’ve got to look forward to. Thirty hair options for Qunari and 88 for non-Qunari, complete with gorgeous physics as Rook scurries through Northern Thedas. So many different hair textures are represented, whether you’d like totally straight hair, 2B waves or 4C curls. In making my character, I was drawn immediately to a long braid that whipped around as quickly as I did. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Qunari horns also see a massive improvement. With 49 unique styles, options range from large and imposing to decorative or even asymmetrical. That said, yes, their foreheads can look pretty jarring. I played as a Qunari mage during most of my preview and will say I got used to the look pretty quickly. Drago n Age: The Veilguard actually only marks the second game of the series where you can play as a Qunari, so the odd imbalance of forehead versus face feels like stylistic growing pains. I remain curious about whether more time with the character creator might help. The Arishok of Dragon Age 2 is, in my opinion, such a beautifully crafted model and I would love to be able to create a Qunari Rook that feels as memorable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every aspect of your Rook is editable, even allowing for facial asymmetry if you choose.</p></div><p>Customization certainly doesn’t stop at hair (or horns) of course. Every aspect of your Rook is editable, even allowing for facial asymmetry if you choose. Sliders allow you to change everything from head shape to the melanin in your skin to the presence of vitiligo. Perhaps my favorite addition, however, is the introduction of body diversity. Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur’s Gate 3 had whiffs of this, but nowhere near what you’re capable of in The Veilguard, which is much more similar to the breadth of the character creator in Dragon’s Dogma 2. For each of the four races, there are plenty of presets to choose from, all with varying heights and muscle/fat distribution. Once you’ve chosen your preset, however, you can build further upon those elements as much as you’d like. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First is a triangulation of coordinates allowing for many unique combinations of body types that are thinner, larger, or more muscular. Height sliders are fun – especially when it means watching my particularly short elf ruin years of Solas’ ritual planning by pushing over a statue. The options feel almost endless. There’s even a glute slider and, yes, I gave my Rook one hell of an ass. All of this is only scratching the surface. I haven’t even gotten into facial hair, makeup, scars or tattoos. As an elf, my Rook sported` some vallaslin, but there are so many different designs for both the face and the body to experiment with. </p><p>While I didn’t spend very much time exploring customization for the Inquisitor, I just know we’ll all get the chance to make them in the way we’ve always imagined. Also, it may be a relief to some of you to know that Veilguard abandons the awful green lighting of Inquisition’s character creator and instead allows you to cycle through several lighting options in service of creating Rooks that look just as good in gameplay as they do when you create them. </p><h3>Fighting Chance</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Combat, meanwhile, was a refreshing change from DA:I. My go-to class has always been mage, and even as a Knight-Enchanter I often felt like I was standing in one place holding down the left trigger. This felt like a return to the pace of DA2, with innovations that improve upon the experience of battle overall. The Veilguard introduces a new fighting style for mages featuring an orb and dagger tailored for close-quarters combat. It’s tailor-made for players like me who love magic but, also, really like to stab. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat was a refreshing change from Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p></div><p>During my preview, I played through the prologue and then dropped forward into various points of Act 1, so I really got to quickly experience the progression Rook and their companions can go through as fighters. We may not be able to take control of our companions this time around, but The Veilguard really encourages strategizing with them. They’ll call out to you when they’ve rebuilt their mana or stamina, and the ability wheel even suggests combos. My focus during the event was mission-driven so I didn’t get as much of a chance to interact with the characters as I would have liked, but even the brief moments of banter endeared me to them pretty quickly. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Each class gets its own ultimate ability (think the Focus ability) along with a ranged attack – for warriors that means yeeting your shield like a giant metal boomerang. I’ve always played Dragon Age for story and not combat, but with this new system I had so much fun. I felt present during every encounter and truly accomplished after every boss battle. That said, there’s definitely a bit of a learning curve. I still found myself confusing controls a few hours in. It’s a departure from all three previous installments, but luckily The Veilguard offers five different difficulty levels that you can change at will if you want to ease yourself in. </p><h3>The Dragon Age-Free Decade Ends Soon </h3><p>As a longtime fan, The Veilguard felt like a homecoming of sorts. Just as much as seeing familiar faces in Solas and Varric, I was overjoyed to be back in the world of Thedas itself. Moving us north allows for that sense of discovery I got in Inquisition, and if I’d encourage anything it’s to really look at your surroundings. Not only are there small environmental puzzles to untangle along with small and effective moments of visual storytelling, but the horizon is full of breathtaking scenery that drives home the scale of these locations I’ve personally always wondered about. One new locale, for instance, is a gorgeous underwater prison called the Ossuary. I won’t spoil what you’re there to do, but the design alone makes it one of the most memorable moments I’ve had in any Dragon Age game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even after hours of gameplay, I still felt like I could have played for many hours more. I’m optimistic about The Veilguard and excited for it in a way I haven’t quite felt about another game in quite some time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Dragon Ball Tenkaichi series is one that meant a lot to me as a teenager and young adult – which was about the peak of my obsession with Dragon Ball Z – but it’s also one that I haven’t really thought about or touched in the last 15 or so years. Fast forward to the present, and after about three hours of hands-on time with Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero, it felt like I was hit with a spirit bomb of nostalgia as I once again got back in there, chaining together rapid movement teleports, bouncing my foes like ping pong balls between multiple vanishing attacks, and kicking them away with so much force that they destroy mountains. It was like reuniting with a dear old friend, and yet, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero feels like much more than just a nostalgia play. It’s packed with new mechanics, a brand new approach to story mode, and a host of other exciting features that I only got a taste of, but I’m excited to dig more into once it comes out next month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The first two hours of my hands-on time was spent on freeplay. I used a large chunk of this time to refamiliarize myself with the Tenkaichi style of gameplay by hitting up Sparking Zero’s exhaustive tutorial mode, which covers all of the many many mechanics present here. There are Vanishing Assaults, Vanishing Attacks, Lightning Attacks, Burst Smashes, Dragon Smashes, high guards, low guards, high speed evasion counters, perception counters, super counters, z-counters, and so on. It’s a lot to take in for sure, but it all serves to enhance the depth of the combat, and most importantly, deliver on the power trip of controlling some of the most powerful characters throughout all of anime. Sure, I might not NEED to know how to knock an enemy away, vanish behind them, drill them into the ground, and then pick them back up and hurl them away like a ragdoll – there are other, simpler ways to get just as much damage, if not more – but doing stuff like that feels so incredibly cool, and to me, that’s what the Tenkaichi series is all about. </p><p>Once I was back up to speed on the combat and mechanics, I decided to check out one of Sparking Zero’s big new modes outside of its story mode: Custom Battles. It lets you create, share, and play out your own fantasy Dragon Ball fight scenarios – complete with options to create an intro cutscene, a title card, mid-match triggers, and outro cutscenes that cover what happens when you win, and when you lose. There’s even a Mario Maker-style rule to it, where in order to share your Custom Battle with other players, you need to be able to prove that it’s possible by beating it yourself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time to craft my own battle to the degree that I would have wanted, so I opted instead to see what the mode was capable of by trying out some pre-made battles that were prepped by the developers. And to my delight, they were a lot of fun, with a great variety of different types of fights. Some were simply based around the idea of pitting certain characters against each other: like a battle of speed demons that had you controlling Burter as you faced off against Kakunsa and Hit. Another had you as Kid Goku going up against Master Roshi to relive one of their training sessions, and forcingforced you to win the fight specifically with whatever move Roshi calls out.by using a Kamehameha.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Custom Battles have great potential as a sandbox for creative players to come up with and share exciting fights that go far beyond the limits of Dragon Ball's canon.</p></div><p>My favorite, though, had me playing as a weak and underpowered Captain Ginyu against an appropriately overpowered Frieza. My only hope for victory was using Ginyu’s ultimate technique, the body-change beam, to swap bodies with Frieza and then easily finish the fight. Easier said than done, as whenever I tried to power up to be able to use the move, Frieza would hit me with an instant-kill death beam. So I had to engage with Frieza in combat just enough to be able to charge my meter, knock him away, and then use that time to charge up into Sparking Mode so I could look for an opening to land the attack. It was a surprisingly tense and refreshingly unique battle, and a great showing of the potential that this mode has as a sandbox for creative players to come up with and share exciting fights that go far beyond the limits of Dragon Ball’s canon. </p><h2>On the Next Episode of Dragon Ball Z</h2><p>After the time for freeplay was up, I got a chance to check out a handful of Episode Battles, which collectively make up Sparking Zero’s story mode. Dragon Ball’s story has been told an ungodly number of times at this point across pretty much all forms of media, but what makes Sparking Zero’s interpretation especially cool is how it gives you multiple opportunities to do things differently from how they’re supposed to go. Right from the start of Goku’s episode battle, when Raditz takes Gohan away and Goku and Piccolo give chase, you actually don’t have to join forces with Piccolo. You’re given the option to instead go it alone, and if you do that, then you’ll be joined by Krillin and fight Raditz in a battle with a completely different outcome. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s not all either. Even if you decide to play it by the canon and team up with Piccolo, if you manage to defeat Raditz before Piccolo is able to charge his attack, you’ll be met with a special fully animated and voiced “Sparking Episode” that plays out this “what if” scenario of Goku surviving his encounter with Raditz, getting to train Gohan himself, and being there right when the Saiyans arrive on Earth. </p><p>Producer Jun Furutani told me that when selecting the battles that they wanted to highlight in Episode Mode, they wanted to focus on the battles that highlighted the playable characters the best in the story, but they also wanted to put a focus on battles that could potentially lead to branching outcomes.</p><p>I followed up and asked Furutani about how substantial these branches could be, to which he replied, “It's a really hard question to answer because depending on which branch we're talking about, it could skew very in a completely different direction. But some branches might just go back to the actual canonical route again. For example, when you fight Raditz, there's some smaller branches that have been there, but it takes you back to the canonical route. And obviously after Raditz is Vegeta and after Vegeta is Frieza. Some of them are just blips, some of them kind of take you in a very drastically different direction.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And while there are eight characters that make up Sparking Zero’s Episode Battle mode, they do seem to vary wildly in terms of length. I played 30 minutes of Goku’s and only got through the Saiyan saga; 30 minutes of Frieza’s only got me to the final battle against Super Saiyan Goku; and then 30-45 minutes of Future Trunks’ story from Dragon Ball Super pretty much finished it all up right there. Still, I’m very much looking forward to diving into all of these at launch and seeing if I can find all of the hidden “what if” moments myself. It’s worth mentioning too that they’re not easy to trigger. The fights themselves are already pretty tough, and to try and accomplish specific added challenges on top of that makes it seem like these are meant as rewards for the most dedicated players – doubly so because you can’t actually trigger these scenes if you lower the difficulty. </p><p>Beyond the Custom and Episode Battle modes, I also messed around with the tournament mode, which allows you to participate in one of many different types of tournaments, each with different rule sets. The Tournament of Power, for example, has you competing on the Tournament of Power stage with flight turned off and ringouts as an alternate win condition; Cell Games is a strictly 1v1 affair with no rules, but you only regain 20% of your life between fights; and Yamcha Games is straight chaos with random rules and random character selection. You can also create your own tournament and customize your very own set of rules as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And then finally there’s the encyclopedia mode, which I got to exclusively check out for a few minutes. It’s a returning feature from Tenkaichi 3, but instead of just having Chichi giving commentary on a character, this time you get Chichi, Bulma, and Videl all gossiping about the cast and giving their own little insights. The little bits I got to listen to were all very amusing, like the girls commentating on how ugly Goku becomes when he transforms into his Super Saiyan 3 form, or how Garlic Jr. looks like a roided-out Emperor Pilaf. </p><p>My relatively short time with Sparking Zero rekindled my love for the Budokai Tenkaichi games and was a much needed reminder that arena fighters can excite and thrill just as much as traditional 2D and 3D fighters can. The attention to detail here is phenomenal; the combat definitely has a learning curve, but is packed full of depth that is very satisfying to learn and engage with; and its story looks to provide a ton of flexibility in how it tells the tale of Dragon Ball. We’ll see how its final form turns out when Dragon Ball Sparking Zero releases next month on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p><p>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

This comes despite Tango Gameworks, developer of The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo alongside Hi-Fi Rush, not having "big success" with its games.</p><p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," Kim said. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organization."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank.</p></div><p>He continued: "We're trying to increase our portfolio lineup and Tango Gameworks comes into play [there]. We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank.</p><p>"But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying in the spirit of challenge taking. Tango Gameworks are creative. They want to try something new, and we want to do more of that. [Making] video games is really a hit or miss industry, and that is risk taking. But having more project lineups is actually a way to mitigate risk, because one of them might work out."</p><p>Kim said that Tango Gamework's previous games "may not even have broken even" and the deal to acquire the studio was "not too expensive, or cheap either." Definitive numbers can't be shared until the deal goes through, but "the dollar amount was not really important to Microsoft," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Hi-Fi Rush Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Krafton announced its intention to buy Tango Gameworks on August 13</a>, three months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft announced its closure alongside other studios and lay-offs</a>. Only the Hi-Fi Rush intellectual property was brought over with Tango Gameworks, however.</p><p>Kim said this was because it knew Hi-Fi rush was the priority for fans and it didn't want to add too much to the deal and overcomplicate things. This would cause it to move slowly and add to the stress of already "anxious" employees.</p><p>"Because Hi-Fi Rush fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company to acquire that IP as well," he said. "We wanted to make sure the deal happens fast to minimize that gap in [employees' careers]."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much.</p></div><p>Kim added: "If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated. We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially Hi-Fi Rush. When I think about our fans, I think what they really care about is Hi-Fi Rush sequels."</p><p>Hi-Fi Rush certainly appeared to be a breakout hit for Tango Gameworks, breaking the mold of its horror game roots as a colorful rhythm action game. "Hi-Fi Rush marches to the beat of its own drum with stunning animation, loveable characters, and stylish rhythmic action that are anything but one-note," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">IGN said in our 9/10 review</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself said the game was a success too, despite it shadow dropping the game with no marketing. Microsoft executive Aaron Greenberg declared the game "was a breakout hit for [Xbox] and [its] players in all key measurements and expectations." He said Microsoft "couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered" when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-hi-fi-rush-hits-2-million-players">it hit two million players after a month</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">received high praise from critics</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But just over a year later the studio was shut down. "So this is how it ends," wrote Tango Gameworks creative director and Hi-Fi rush director John Johanas on <a href="https://twitter.com/johnjohanas/status/1787877169504391613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>. "Unfortunately I don't quite have the words. But at least thank you to everyone who supported us."</p><p>Krafton kept the studio alive though, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/around-50-of-100-tango-gameworks-staff-moving-over-to-krafton">brought over around 50 of the 100 staff members</a>. It's unclear why the remaining approximately 50 staff didn't join Krafton, but it's possible they had already found jobs elsewhere as the studio's closure was announced three months earlier.</p><p>Kim made clear Krafton had no plans to lower the number of staff, and even suggested an expansion was on the cards.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p dir="ltr">The statement covers a lot of topics, from the upcoming Flappy Bird developer's acquisition of the Flappy Bird trademark to commentary on the studio's relationship with the creator of Piou Piou Vs Cactus, a mobile game that preceded Flappy Bird and inspired a large part of Flappy Bird's gameplay.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/flappy_bird/status/1836525841037087127" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We’ve seen questions circulating online and we’re here to provide the Flappy Bird community with all the answers.<br>Let’s clear the air we’re currently flying through ⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/fdtjfcZBn6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/fdtjfcZBn6</a></p>  — Flappy Bird (@flappy_bird) <a href="https://twitter.com/flappy_bird/status/1836525841037087127?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>But the Flappy Bird foundation doesn't even attempt to address some of the game's biggest criticisms, like Flappy Bird chief creative Mark Roberts' <a href="https://x.com/MichaelRRoberts/status/1835670559134556656" rel="nofollow ">enthusiastic support for cryptocurrency</a>, Web 3.0, and blockchain technology--especially as it relates to Flappy Bird.

Releasing ten years after the release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(formerly known as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dreadwolf</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) took some time to find itself during its lengthy development, which unfortunately saw key BioWare staff depart the company. During this time period, BioWare also released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a co-op multiplayer title that struggled to find an audience and drifted the studio away from its single-player roots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is shaping up to be a modernized take on a classic BioWare roleplaying game, one that leans into the dev's rich history of storytelling and cast of characters—all of which inform players' decision making as they navigate the political and social strands of the world of Dragon Age during dark times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As creative director Jonathan Epler explained to Game Developer in a recent interview following an extended hands-on with the game, taking time away from Dragon Age gave the studio a chance to learn from its mistakes (and successes) of the last decade. He said that the team took inspiration from previous critically-acclaimed DLC releases—and that he has an aversion to the phrase "BioWare Magic."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/alone-in-the-dark-etrospective" target="_self">Shining a flashlight on Alone in the Dark, on the eve of its reinvention</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Revisiting Dragon Age with renewed focus">Revisiting Dragon Age with renewed focus</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Set years after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sees the world of Dragon Age facing an apocalypse. Playing as Rook, a new protagonist of the player's making, you assemble a team of new and veteran heroes to take on the evil gods causing mass chaos and decide the fate of Thedas in its darkest period. This all occurs after after the ritual performed by former alley Solas goes awry, shattering the barrier between the mortal realm and the Veil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sense of impending doom amid an apocalyptic event is at the forefront of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and right from the opening, we fight through the capital city, Minrathous, which is overrun by demons. It's a raucous cold open that accommodates series newcomers and chaotically greets returning players. The prologue serves as an effective opener for what's to come as well as a showcase of the game's pivot to a more guided, mission-based structure that blends faster and more dynamic action with character-driven storytelling.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the Epler, this significant shift to a more tightly designed RPG without the open world sprawl was not only in response to player feedback following </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but also served the vision of the game's deeper focus on its characters.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46" target="_self">Preserving the Past With Charles Cecil: Game Developer Podcast Ep. 46</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It's interesting, for a BioWare game we usually start with designing the world and story and go from there, but for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we knew pretty much from the start that we wanted to make this game all about the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sees-bioware-return-to-an-emphasis-on-companion-characters">companions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and your relationship to them," said Epler. "Above all, we wanted to ensure that each character has a key role to play in the main story—we never wanted to have a companion that has one thing going for them in the party and just stays there for the rest of the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"After bringing the Dragon Age series to an open-world-style format in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, you’d be forgiven for thinking </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would take place in an even bigger landscape. In truth, it actually goes a different way, leaning more into the type of experience that feels closer to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a more contained, mission-driven experience that hopefully is filled with less busywork."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Less sprawl, more purpose">Less sprawl, more purpose</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the opening sequence, Rook and their crew find themselves in a haven in the Veil known as the Lighthouse, an evolving base of operations where the party can coordinate and plan their next move. It also serves as the nexus point for travel to the different cities and zones in Thedas. The Lighthouse felt like a familiar headquarters—akin to the Normandy from Mass Effect—but with more incentive for internal exploration.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/deep-dive-developing-a-rating-system-and-recording-tv-in-the-crush-house" target="_self">Deep Dive: Developing a rating system and making juicy TV in The Crush House</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">True to the developer's claims, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> effectively presents an endearing party and a sense of camaraderie, and you assemble a proper crew quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When going into the different explorable spaces, this is where the game's more guided and mission-focused structure became clear. Instead of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s sprawling open-ended zones, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s different regions present more of a structured and focused space to explore—akin to the zones from games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While initially these zones felt smaller in scope—and they certainly are compared to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, especially its infamous Hinterlands area</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>—</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">they do open up throughout the story as Rook gains new abilities and learns of new threats.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking with Epler, the choice to move away from the open-world experience and back to a more traditional story-driven progression was to focus on the game's cast of characters and their growth while avoiding a sense of aimlessness and fatigue that was present within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Epler particularly mentioned the response to how players engaged The Hinterlands, which many players struggled to get past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Hinterlands zone from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was something we really reflected on after the release," said Epler, "We realized we needed a stronger narrative hold to get you out of that zone because, at the time, we wanted players to experience the space how they wanted to in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but it ended up making it easy to lose track of the main story arc for that game and feel somewhat aimless. So, for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we wanted to ensure that no matter where you go and what you do, there's always this looming threat of the ancient gods or the end of the world coming."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We made sure that the game's content was much more focused and anchored by that narrative hook."</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained the team was greatly inspired by the beloved downloadable expansions from previous games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trespasser</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Citadel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mass Effect 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "I think a lot of the lessons we learned that helped us with building up </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was from Inquisition's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trespasser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">DLC," said the creative director. "The full game is a big, big adventure and a big open world, and we got a lot of feedback about how going open world made the story and narrative feel diluted, and like they didn't matter as much. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trespasser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">for us was putting more of a focus on the story, the villain, and building the experience around that tighter and more contained story."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"BioWare has always been about its cast of characters and its tighter story, and we learned from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trespasser</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, along with Mass Effect 3's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Citadel </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">DLC, that it was OK to focus things down a little bit from the open world structure and put the story, the side content, characters into a tighter experience."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Is BioWare truly going back to its roots?">Is BioWare truly going back to its roots?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I was really impressed by the player companions, a feature BioWare has long specialized in. One stand-out character was Lucanis, an assassin specialized in hunting rogue mages who also happens to be haunted by an evil spirit that only he can see. The interactions with Lucanis, and how he plays off player choices and the reactions from his dark passenger felt very much like classic, multifaceted BioWare-style character growth—but with a pretty fantastic sense of gravitas layered on.</span></p><p>Image via BioWare/Electronic Arts.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Epler acknowledged that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> took some time to find its vision during development—especially as BioWare was in an awkward transitional period following the 2014 release of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Inquisition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The phrase 'Bioware Magic' is something I kind of have an allergic reaction to at this point when I hear it, but for us when it comes to making this game, it was all about the characters of this world and building that world up," said Epler. "That's what we're best at, and it's also a reflection of the people who made this game. This team has pulled something truly amazing together and I think people will see that excitement and love that's been poured into every detail of this game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> presents an exciting return to the series that's more of a punchy and character-driven take on a high-fantasy epic. For the creative director, the game represents a big moment for BioWare and its focus on moving back to its roots and bringing the studio back to what they have done best.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Honestly, the big lesson we learned during the making of this game was that we just need to focus on what we're built to do. BioWare has always been about building strong, character focused role-playing games throughout. We did certainly try other things during the development of this game, but once we really focused deeply on what BioWare is really all about, that was when the game really took shape for us. I want this game to feel like you're coming home to the Dragon Age universe, and setting foot back into Thedas."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

<p>Two Point Museum follows <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-hospital">Two Point Hospital</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/two-point-campus">Two Point Campus</a> in the series, and allows players to create and manage their own museum.</p>
<p>This being a Two Point game, though, expect plenty of whacky exhibits and British humour, as well as expeditions to acquire new items.</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's announcement, the studio revealed the game's Marine Life museum theme in addition to prehistory. It's currently unknown what other museum themes will be included.</p>
<p>"Designing a museum, decorating exhibits, adding gifts shops full of tat, providing restaurants, and seeking donations. All the obvious boxes have been ticked, but these alone would be mundane," I wrote after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">previewing Two Point Museum</a>. "Because of course, here in the world of Two Point County, exhibits aren't just a handful of bones but opportunities for discovery, as well as potential disaster."</p>
<p>To celebrate the game's release date reveal, Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus are now on sale on Steam with an 80 percent discount, with all DLCs available for 50 percent off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>BioWare was suspiciously coy when asked whether it was considering releasing a standalone character creator for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> before the game's full release on 31st October.</p>
<p>When asked at a preview event whether it was under consideration, the game's co-director Corinne Busche replied, "It's a much requested feature; we're TBD on that but it would be pretty stinking cool." The question itself was asked by Outside Xbox's charming Andy Farrant.</p>
<p>I was at that preview event and I played the new Dragon Age game all day, and you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-playing-it-all-day-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feels-like-the-series-mass-effect-2-moment">whether I think The Veilguard is any good</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-i-learned-talking-to-bioware-about-dragon-age-the-veilguard">what I learnt talking to BioWare about it</a>, elsewhere on the site.</p>

<p>The character creator itself is fabulous, by the way. BioWare games have always pushed the level of customisation available and The Veilguard is no exception. You can sculpt body size and structure as well as face size and structure, and even determine bulge size, or your melanin level, or whether your character has cataracts - in one or both eyes. The hair is also a standout feature of the new game. It flows believably and looks less like someone stuck some hair-shaped cardboard to your head and more like, well, actual hair.</p>
<p>You can choose between four races as in other Dragon Age games - human, elf, qunari and dwarf - and when asked about player choice in this regard, and how BioWare will encourage people to play as all of those races, Busche revealed a telling statistical tidbit.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Bertie's-Rogue-Rook-1---DA-Veilguard-Char-Customisation.mp4.00_06_44_00.Still002.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

</figure>
<p>"So here's a little fun fact for you," she said. "In Dragon Age Inquisition, only five percent of players ever played a dwarf. What we see in our player testing these days [in The Veilguard] is we're up to 12 percent, so we'll take it." (For what it's worth, I created a dwarf, so I've probably edged those numbers up a bit.) "What that tells me is the more options you give players to embody the character they want to be, the more engaged they're going to be. We know our players love that. They're hungry for it.</p>
<p>"One of the things I might also add," she added, "is that of our three core design pillars, 'be who you want to be' was the first - that was the starting point. We wanted everyone to feel like they belong in this game, to the best of our ability; that you could relate to the characters, the options. So that meant Sclera colour, it meant cataracts, it meant vitiligo, freckles, respectful skin tones that react to light properly."</p>
<p>Should BioWare go ahead and release a standalone character creator before the game comes out, you'll have plenty of time to play around with it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>With the full game’s launch a little over a month away, Square Enix has released a free demo for Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, a full 3D remake of the early 90s fan favourite. The demo is available now across PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven | TGS 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRWoyq8bozU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven demo will be a great opportunity to preview the work done to revive this game for modern audiences, giving players access to the beginning of the game. You’ll step into the shows of Emperor Leon as he and his second son, Prince Gerard, embark on the multi-generational story that runs through the game. The demo will build up to and conclude with the battle against Kzinssie, one of the Seven Heroes.</p>
<p>In a touch that’s always nice to see, you’ll be able to transfer any demo progress across to the full game.</p>
<p>The new trailer for Tokyo Game Show, meanwhile, showcases the fallen Seven Heroes and gives hints of their past. It also shows off two new classes, the&nbsp;Imperial Blacksmith and Dancer.</p>

<p>Romancing SaGa 2, the fifth game in the SaGa series when including the Final Fantasy Legend trilogy, originally launched in 1993 for the Super Famicom, building on the nonlinear narrative structure of the previous game. The game was previously remastered in its original form back in 2016, but this remake – coming from the team behind the 2020 Trials of Mana remake – will bring a lot of more modern flourishes to the classic adventure.</p>
<p>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven launch is set for 24th October 2024.</p>
