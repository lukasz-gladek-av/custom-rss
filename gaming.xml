			<p>Following the collaboration <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-marvel-collaborate-games-tv-shows-comic-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Marvel and NetEase five years ago, NetEase unveiled the Overwatch-like competitive 6 versus 6 third-person shooter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-an-overwatch-like-6v6-pvp-third-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Closed Beta test, which will run from July 23 to August with the following content (Characters: Adam Warlock, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot, Hela, Hulk, Iron Man, Loki, Luna Snow, Magik, Magneto, Mantis, Namor, Peni Parker, Punisher, Rocket Raccoon, Star-Lord, Storm, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Venom; Maps: Yggsgard: Yggdrasill Path, Yggsgard: Royal Palace, Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya, and Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands; Modes: Convoy, Domination, and Convergence), we interviewed Executive Producer Danny Koo and Game Director Thad Sasser at Summer Game Fest 2024.</p>

<p><iframe title="TOKYO 2099: SPIDER-ISLANDS - JOURNEY INTO LIFE AND DESTINY | Map Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqnZzywDfTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>With the roster being as diverse as it is, I was curious - what was your design philosophy for choosing roles for each character?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> First of all, we know Marvel characters are iconic, so there are certain expectations fans expect out of the characters. So, we picked the three most important things about the characters if we were to represent them in the game. Once we identify them, then we'll pair the skills and assign the role after. The entire Marvel Rivals roster kind of consists of about 70 percent fan favorite, greatest pitch, and we'll throw in some curveball on the rest. For some players, this game might be their first time learning about these characters. Since this is a global game, and it's on PC and consoles, everyone gets exposure to this diverse cast of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Did you think about possibly doing an alternate version of the characters, like Iron Man in a different role?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> I don't think we've really kind of thought about that. I think the way we think about it is, as Danny said, the first and most important thing is really the character, right? Representing the iconic nature of that character, finding those three things that are true to it. And then the class or the role kind of comes later. You might see, and I'm not saying there is or there isn't, but you might see a character completely shift their power set based on events that happened in the narrative that we tell as the game evolves.</p>
<p>Maybe this character had a change in their circumstances. Things have changed for them and now they're a different type of play experience. That would be the kind of thing we would love to experiment with and get player feedback on. So, we'd love to hear more ideas like that.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> Yeah, a lot of players in the hero shooter genre got used to the notion of tank, DPS, and support. But in Marvel Rivals, we take it further because Marvel heroes don't hang in the back; they're just clashing. So there are hybrid roles that a lot of characters have. That's why we have Vanguard, Duelists, and Strategists, which can turn the tide of the battle.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> And those are less about a hard role and more about kind of like almost the gameplay style or choice. The Vanguard is gonna jump into the midst of the enemies, while the Duelists are going to maneuver up and stay in close combat, keep the pressure on, and the Strategists are trying to figure out how can I disrupt, how can I buff my party or debuff the enemy.</p>
<p>Some of the characters might even currently, in their current state, be able to do some of these jobs that they're not necessarily the best at, but they can still kind of move around a little bit. So there's a little bit more flexibility than a rigid class definition, which you might be used to.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> There's the synergy skills as well. When Rocket jumps on Groot, it becomes like a giant tank with a machine gun.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not even thinking about eSports. Once we establish a strong foundation for the community, this will grow organically instead of forcibly.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A lot of online games tend to feature a Prime or powered-up version of a particular character. Would Marvel Rivals experiment with stuff like Ultimate Spider-Man?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> I know there are a bunch of opinions among friends that this Spider-Man or that Spider-Man is the best. There are so many opportunities for us to do stuff like a different costume or maybe introduce a different voice line. But we haven't announced all this detail in terms of costumes and variance yet. We want each main playable character to have a different playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Do you consider the costumes to be more like a seasonal reward or something that players can unlock as an additional skin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We haven't announced the monetization mechanism or anything yet. But I can tell you that during the Alpha, players do quests to get currency to unlock skins and costumes. We have those in the Alpha, and we look forward to that in beta as well.</p>
<p><strong>How can players customize the identity of the characters in Marvel Rivals? Some games have emotes, voice lines, or sprays that players can customize. What sort of options are there in this game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> Yes, we know that's important to players and we'll have some options. We're not going to talk about the details yet, but in the Alpha we did have the spray.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>It's pretty standard in Alpha, but we have a few surprises in store for later.</p>
<p><strong>As the roster grows over time, would you consider adding a pick-and-ban system to the hero list?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser:</strong> Yeah, I think that kind of feature would be something we'd be looking for feedback from the community, right? Is this something that's required that the community thinks is best in a competitive playlist, for example? Or is this a casual mode thing? Or should it apply everywhere? And that kind of thing would be something we would talk about and, you know, we'll have an opportunity to try these things out and see what the feedback is, really, before we go wide with it.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Ultimately, we build this game for the community, not for us. I have a different opinion than all these guys. But, you know, we want to take care of the community. They're going to spend time on this game, so we might as well ask hey, what do you guys want?</p>
<p><strong>How are you going to support Marvel Rivals at the eSports level?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We want to make this game, first and foremost, the best-in-class PvP. We're not even thinking about eSports. Once we establish a strong foundation for the community, I think this will grow organically instead of forcibly.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a spectator mode for players who want to run tournaments, build an orbit around them, and watch the action without being players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yes, that is already in the game. There is a spectator mode, and we have a custom game in there, where players can play a custom game however they want with anybody. We have cross-region play as well, where players can invite their friends internationally and play with each other. After each match, there's a reason why we put the entire team up instead of focusing on one MVP. You get to check the highlights of everyone who plays on your team to share the glory.</p>
<p><strong> Which platforms are you planning to launch Marvel Rivals on? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Right now, we announced PC, Xbox, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about cross-platform play between them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yes, and we'll be cross-play in beta as well.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. How about cross-progression? Are you implementing a NetEase profile so that if someone unlocks something on a PC, they can carry it to PlayStation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>To be decided. As you can imagine, that's extremely complicated to pull off, so we're still looking into it. We've heard that the audience has already suggested this several times, so we're looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>Are you implementing rollback netcode or something of that sort to help stabilize online connection for players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Well, the stability and the quality of the online connection are very important for us, so we'll have a number of different systems. I don't necessarily have all the technical details at the moment, but that is definitely a big concern for us because low latency and high-quality gameplay are some of the things that make a game fun: feeling comfortable with the controls and feeling comfortable with the experience is very important, and we recognize that as a priority for us.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo:</strong> That's why we are going to have North America, Europe, and other regions in the beta that we haven't announced yet. I can tell you from the Alpha within the North American region that the ping is very stable, so we're happy about that now. But the more testing, the better.</p>
<p><strong>As far as the breadth of content you guys can pull from, is there anything that's off-limits for Marvel Rivals?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Anything is possible.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We have over 9,000 characters in Marvel. 85 years of Marvel history. But when we put a character in there, it has to be with a reason, not just because. Any character has to relate to the lore and the story as well as the other characters on the existing roster. This is a Marvel Universe game, and we want to have a roster of characters from the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the X-Men. We don't want it to just be an Avengers or an X-Men game; we want it to have everybody in it.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any sort of playable narrative mode? Or is it mostly competing in matches against each other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>We're focusing on PvP. But, within the map, within the voice dialogues, within the bios they can unlock, it's very detailed on what the story is, and the player can piece it together. Like, for example, in the map that you played (Odin's Palace), there's one starting point where you can see a family portrait.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We might not do another beta if the first one is great.'</figcaption></figure>
<p>What's going on there? And then, and then you get a hint of, like, what the map looks like with a giant battle plan at the starting point. And that's like a little, little sprinkle to slowly tell the story. In the Odin Palace, some destructible get reconstructed, and there's a reason why: Loki is the king, and that's his illusion. In other maps, there are also different ways in which destructible environments tell a story.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>This will tie into things like the game modes as well, right? The Payload object might be different based on the context and what it is that you're doing.</p>
<p><strong>For objective modes like Payload, is each map going to kind of have the same objectives each time you play through or will it pull random objectives for each round?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>The maps are very specific because they are tuned for that particular game mode, but each map does support multiple game modes. So, if you play best of seven, then you will not see like your regular mode. There will be certain expectations of objectives within.</p>
<p><strong>Are you talking about accessibility options, such as high-contrast character profile models, like Black Panther in a darker environment, which might be hard to spot for some players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Yes, accessibility is a key issue for us. In fact, we want this game to be very accessible and we are looking at several levels of accessibility. Not just whether users can understand this and learn it and master it, but also what if you're colorblind? What if you're hard of hearing? What can we do to help all different types of players? How many different types of players can we get in here? We'd love it if every player could enjoy Marvel Rivals. That said, obviously, there are practical limits to what we can accomplish, but it's important to us.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Yeah, we would never have an overly dark environment. Even I couldn't. I don't have to be disabled to want that. We wanted it to be a very colorful, vibrant, and inviting environment. And then, of course, some people can't see red. And we support controller mode on PC, also for the people who can't use keyboard and mouse. We even have alternative controller styles.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, the character models are very contrasted. They have colors that pop compared to the environments, which are much more muted, so it's easy to recognize the action from afar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>That's intentional, as we spend a lot of time looking at that. How visible are these characters in this environment? And we're continually tweaking that. In fact, not that long ago, we made some changes to increase the visibility of characters in environments. We have some tricks we're doing now.</p>
<p><strong>I know you guys have another closed test coming up. How is your test schedule shaping up for the inevitable launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>It depends on the result of the closed beta. We might not do another beta if it's great, right? Otherwise, we might do another round of beta. So, we don't know yet. Right now, we're focusing on beta. But we got a lot of feedback from the Alpha where people said, why don't you launch it right now? It's already done. We were like, no, no, no. No, it's not done. The job's not finished.</p>
<p>That was an ongoing discussion on our Discord. By the way, if you're not on our Discord, we have a community of over 230K users. If the game is not ready, it's not ready. But when it is, we're definitely looking forward to announcing this news to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>We have the closed beta coming up at the end of July, which we'll discuss more shortly.</p>
<p><strong> Is the closed beta going to be PC only or will it also include consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>It'll be available on all three platforms: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>Players can wishlist the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> right now, and they'll receive a notification when they can join the beta.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to do any pre-purchase or founder pack bonuses that you can talk about for Marvel Rivals?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Danny Koo: </strong>The beta is going to be free for everybody. We're not doing anything extra on top of that.</p>
<p><strong>What's on the table for post-launch content for Marvel Rivals, whether it's characters, maps, or modes? What are you guys looking at?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thad Sasser: </strong>Yes. The answer is yes. What does the audience want? What needs are not being met, or what do they want to see more of? What's working really well? We'll have to check all these things.</p>
<p><strong>Alright, well, thank you all so very much for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/compensation-tarkov-cheaters/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you%E2%80%99re-going-to-get-rewarded-for-reporting-tarkov-cheaters.915264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/compensation-tarkov-cheaters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a series of changes and improvements being made to Escape from Tarkov in patch 0.14.9.5, Battlestate Games has introduced some interesting updates. One important mechanic will see players compensated for successfully reporting cheaters – but the reward itself hasn’t been clarified yet. This means that when you report someone and you’re notified that they’ve been banned, you’ll get <strong>something </strong>in the way of compensation, be it roubles, random items, or something else.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-money-for-nothing">Money for Nothing</h2>



<p>Presently, a change like this could make you a Tarkov millionaire overnight. It’s no big secret that the game is still being plagued by cheaters, and no server seems to be safe. At least now you’ll get a little something back in your pocket if you report these malicious operators and they’re kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Battlestate Games revealed that soon, the newly introduced PvE mode will be available for purchase for owners of all game editions – and several changes are coming to <strong>that </strong>part of the game. First, improvements are on the way for AI PMCs in PvE, and the ability to reset your profile is also inbound. For solo PvE players, Battlestate is introducing local play, allowing users to get access to a game almost immediately, bypassing the need to queue for a server. </p>



<p>Tweaks are also being made to the in-game wishlist mechanic, new outfits are being added to the game (via Ragman), and a fresh questline called ‘Nostalgia’ is being added. Battlestate is bringing in an in-game poll system (but we’re not sure how it’ll work), and the team is pumping in a slew of quality-of-life changes.</p>



<p>This patch was supposed to go live this month, but it has now been pushed back to early July.</p>

<p>TwitchCon Europe 2024 is ongoing in Rotterdam, and to kick off the event, representatives of the platform announced changes coming to the ecosystem – as well as some interesting new features and mechanics that’ll change how the platform works. There’s nothing <strong>groundbreaking</strong>, but a few of these changes should increase collaboration and discovery, which are some of the most important aspects for new streamers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-starts-with-the-app">It Starts With The App</h2>



<p>Since 2019, the Twitch app has remained relatively the same in terms of its overall appearance – but that’s changing. In May, a test group received a new, upgraded look for their Twitch mobile app, and soon, it’ll be rolled out globally. This changes how users interact with the application, covering everything from the menus to new discovery feeds that give users direct access to algorithm-driven collections of clips. </p>



<p>It was <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/06/29/everything-we-announced-at-twitchcon-rotterdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed by Twitch</a> that clips are one of the most important areas looked at in the recent round of changes. They’re being optimised on the platform for discovery, with Twitch bringing around a better flow for a feed that mimics sites like TikTok. Everything from clip creation to editing and ultimately sharing your clips has been improved – or will be in the near future.</p>



<p>Alongside tidbits like a new Enhanced Broadcasting Beta for NVIDIA-based streamers and the opening of an enrolment pathway for the new DJ program sat another juicy piece of information: Creator Clubs. Twitch is debuting a new ‘program’ that ‘helps streamers find communities around shared interests’. It’s social networking for Twitch, allowing users to join curated clubs, share content and make friends based on their likemindedness. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-journalists-verified-the-dr-disrespect-allegations.915243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-dr-disrespect-allegations-journalists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The reason Dr Disrespect got banned from Twitch is finally out there. Thank goodness. Now we can stop talking about him. We figured, however, that we’d dip one last bucket into that well by spotlighting the good work of Ash Parrish, our former Kotaku colleague turned Verge reporter, who <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played a pivotal role in verifying the allegations</a>. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talked to her about how it all came together.</p><p>We begin by asking Ash what happened in the immediate aftermath (dot site) of an ex-Twitch employee’s decision to suddenly tweet out the reason behind Dr Disrespect’s ban last Friday. Why is that what it took to shake loose new sources, and how did reporters verify that they actually knew what they were talking about? Then we answer one of the major questions the recent torrent of information has produced: Why did it take journalists – some of whom had known the reason for years beforehand – so long to <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally make it public</a>? Why now? We also talk about the process of reporting out sensitive stories involving victims and <a href="https://aftermath.site/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-minor-whisper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we think will happen next</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, we move on to a discussion of<em> Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, an expansion so divisive that it summons Chris Person from The Land of Shadow to share his misgivings. Lastly, we come up with a killer game idea based on the TV show <em>Severance</em> (call us, Apple).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can launch our own edgy streamer persona who [five seconds later] we regret to inform you that the edgy streamer persona <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkshake_Duck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is a terrible person</a>.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> What happened on your end, Ash, that allowed you to confirm this after it had been so hard for people to figure out?</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> What happened with me was that this whole thing came out late Friday, and I received a message from someone who said they worked at Twitch on the trust and safety team, and that they had some additional context to share. And after a conversation with this person that was able to confirm some details and essentially prove they were who they said they were, we were able to publish a story that was essentially able to corroborate what Cody Conners – who was the Twitch employee who first tweeted it out – was tweeting.&nbsp;</p><p>And then from there, dominoes started falling. Cecilia D’Anastasio at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-25/youtuber-dr-disrespect-was-allegedly-kicked-off-twitch-for-messaging-minor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> was also able to publish a piece with a couple more sources from Twitch – firsthand sources that kind of shed light on this. And then after that, we got confirmation from Dr Disrespect himself that basically was like “Yeah, I did the things that they are saying I did.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That confirmation took the form of a <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1805668256088572089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet</a> on his Twitter account. It wasn’t to any reporters or anything. In case people aren’t caught up on this nightmare we’ve been living in for a week.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right. And so the reason he got banned is that he was exchanging messages via Twitch’s DM system – their Whisper system, is what it was called – with a minor in 2017, and these were explicit messages. Not the kind of thing that any sane adult should be exchanging with a minor. Basically what happened is, when Twitch caught wind of this in 2020 – as a result of somebody reporting it – Twitch moved extremely rapidly to ban Dr Disrespect.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what made it really hard for a lot of reporters to confirm it. When it first happened back in 2020, I tried to report it out and had a few different sources telling me “Here’s the basics of what happened.” It’s been the same story ever since. But those sources were like “Well, I wasn’t there at the time; I only heard this from somebody who was there. But I can’t give you their information. I can’t tell you who they are.” The reason for that is that the number of people who were there at the time – because Twitch sort of bypassed its own protocols to do this – was very, very small.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t know if you heard this, Ash, but the impression I’ve gotten over the years is that it was maybe 10-15 people who were present or helped make the decision, and then most of the rest of Twitch was in the dark.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>That’s the key element to all of this, because one of the things that has come out now that this story is out so much is [commentary like] “Well, Twitch should be investigated because they covered up a crime” or “The journalists who are tweeting like they knew about it or heard about it were sitting on a story to profit” or whatever. The thing people don’t understand – that, Riley, you have written about – is we can’t just write about the first thing that comes across our desk.</p><p>Especially for a story like this, involving sensitive material like exploiting minors or big famous people with lots of money, you have to be airtight. You have to make sure that the things you are reporting are airtight from people with firsthand knowledge of the situation. For a long time, we didn’t have that. And now, because this person that I spoke to was on the trust and safety team at the time [Disrespect] was banned and had firsthand information on how all of that went down, we were finally able to report the way that we were.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> The response to me has been so interesting because I took the stance that it does feel weird. I don’t fault normal people for being like “What the hell?” after the tweet came out Friday night. I feel like there was a surge of people corroborating that they heard it. So I understand the reaction of “Wait, did everybody know about this?” But the situation has been useful to me, a journalist who always wants to talk about journalism, for talking about how journalism works. Our colleague Mikhail <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/dr-disrespect-is-allegedly-not-like-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote a really good newsletter</a> about why people haven’t reported on it. So it was exciting for me to see you get something out Sunday night. I feel a bit of pride that you and Cecilia [were responsible for corroborating the story]. I’ve been an editor to both of you, and I was like “Aw, my children!”</p><p><strong>Ash:</strong> Kotaku alumni. Hell yeah. There’s a funny personal story related to how all of that happened, but I don’t think this is the venue for it. But one day, I will share.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You can’t drop a bomb like that and then say “But later!”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Here’s something you can maybe talk about: I’ve seen a lot of people say they want to see the proof, and people want to know how you know. I saw a lot of the less savory elements of the internet be like “Oh, that’s anonymous sources. That’s hearsay!” I know from being an editor that everything you report goes through a rigorous legal process, and I’ve done this with Nathan where you tediously go through every quote in a story checking and checking and checking, and I was wondering if you could speak at all to what process you went through on your end with The Verge.</p><p><strong>Ash: </strong>So the number one thing – and the thing that scared me about this initially – was, you always want to feel like the people who are speaking to you confidentially are speaking to you in good faith and that you can believe the things they’re telling you, because they’re taking great personal risk to do so. But you always have to be skeptical. So one of the things that we did to make sure before we reported what we did is [confirm] that this person is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p><p>It feels weird because it’s like “I don’t want you to believe that I think you’re lying, but I have to prove who you are. Are you comfortable with sharing that information with me?” To this person’s credit, they were. We were really grateful for that, because there are gonna be a lot of times when – especially when you get down to brass tacks in reporting a story like this – somebody will approach you and be like “I have insider information about this that I want to talk about, but I want to be anonymous,” and they’ll tell you their story, but then when it’s time to write the story and I need some clarifying information and I need them to prove who they are, they kinda get cold feet. They’re like “Oh shit, if I tell this person who I am – even though they’ve said they’re not gonna share my identity – I’m afraid that the things I have said could potentially reveal who I am.” And so they back out, and that’s how a lot of pieces die.</p><p>So thankfully this person who spoke to me did not get that kind of cold feet. They were able to be like “This is me, and this is what I did. Here’s all my stuff” – their bonafides that made it such that we could report it that way. And to Riley’s point about proof, with this specific case, involving the topics it involves – including potential exploitation of a minor and sexting – you cannot keep that kind of evidence. That’s not something Twitch wants to keep on its servers. That’s not something you want to personally possess.&nbsp;</p><p>So I understand this desire of “Let me see everything with my own two eyes,” but there are a lot of legal entanglements that prevent that kind of thing. So I understand why people want to ask that, but you don’t need to see it because, first of all, it involves a minor, and second of all, your chances of getting it are very low because companies don’t keep that shit on the books. Because they open themselves to a lot of legal liability if they do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’ve seen people like <a href="https://x.com/Tfue/status/1805971554062291272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tfue</a> say, like, “Show the Whispers.” And it’s like, OK well, this involves a victim. Even if someone somehow got their hands on the whispers, the victim may not have consented to those being shown. That could do potential harm to the victim both in terms of exposing their identity and also just in terms of showing something really sensitive from when they were literally a kid. That does emotional damage. That hurts somebody. The victim has not come forward after all these years. There is likely a reason for that. So to just show the Whispers for the sake of proving to people – who, by the way, will never be satisfied no matter how much evidence they see – that this is real, that just harms the victim.</p><p>I think on the internet there’s this desire for lurid detail. But what you need is all out there. Doc said he did it. Companies have dropped him after doing their own investigations. Journalists have looked into it. It’s all out there. The rest is just this desire for people online to be able to gawk at the absolute most heinous shit they can look at. And that, I think, is a really unfortunate instinct.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
