            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has announced a major restructuring of its business, with a new operating model that will place its current teams into five specialised ‘Creative Houses’ with dedicated lead studios, but coming at the cost of another round of layoffs, scaled back remote working, and with game cancellations, including the troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is seemingly safe, though.</p>


<p>Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft CEO, explained the plan and reasoning: “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands. On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</p>
<p>“At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best-in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.”</p>
<p>The new structure follows the kind of naming convention that we see at Capcom and Nintendo, with numbered divisions that each specialises in a series or genre. We already saw the first step of this with the co-funded Vantage Studios that now looks after Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and this is Creative House 1. Each CH will be more independent and ‘decentralised’, and the financial accountability will be within that division as oppose to Ubisoft as a whole.</p>

<p>The new groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>CH1</b> (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands – Brands including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</li>
<li><b>CH2</b> dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences –&nbsp;Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell</li>
<li><b>CH3</b> designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences – Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones</li>
<li><b>CH4</b> dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes – Brands including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil</li>
<li><b>CH5</b> focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games – Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon</li>
</ul>
<p>Six games are being cancelled as a consequence of this, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake and 4 unannounced titles, three of which were new IPs. However, there are 4 new IPs still in development, including March of Giants.</p>
<p>However, to make this happen, Ubisoft is bringing an end to remote working. All teams will need to return to five days a week on site, though there will be an annual allowance of work from home days. Ubisoft says this is because they want more in-person collaboration and constant knowledge sharing, and all that stuff, but doesn’t mention the positives of remote working, like not having to deal with an energy-sapping and potentially costly commute, having more flexibility with home life and work, and not having to be in an office.</p>
<p>Further to this, Ubisoft’s ‘cost reduction initiatives’ are being pushed further to cut €100 million year on year. Their studio in Halifax closed earlier this month, and their Stockholm studio will follow. There’s also restructuring at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. A further €200 million cost reduction is set to take place over the next two years.</p>
<p>Oh, but Ubisoft has the cash to throw at the Generative AI money pit, with “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p>
<p>This obviously sucks for those affected, and we wish them all the best in finding new employment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There will be no more remote work—or at least very limited opportunities—for Ubisoft employees moving forward. Instead, Ubisoft employees will be required to be in office on a full time basis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the French-based publisher announced major restructuring plans that including a number of games, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, being canceled. While the announcement also spoke about plans to focus more on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Games-As-A-Service (GAAS) and open world experiences</a>, they also revealed a policy change that will impact all employees within the company. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-wants-all-employees-in-the-office">Ubisoft Wants All Employees In The Office</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official press release</a>, Ubisoft will return to a full five days on site “for all teams”. Staff will then receive an “annual allowance of working-from-home days.”</p>



<p>“This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams,” they said “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p>



<p>SVP of Studio Operations Marie Sophie de Waubert&nbsp;told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that the company is still working with “a hybrid model, but spread differently”.</p>







<p>After the news broke, one source reached out to Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw to say that they’d expect the eventual layoffs to be “in the hundreds”. During its conference call to discuss the moves, Ubisoft wouldn’t discuss how many more layoffs would be coming as part of this restructure within the company. </p>



<p>Recently, the company has held layoffs at its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-to-layoff-55-employees-across-the-division-developers-and-stockholm-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massive Entertainment</a> as well as at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cut-nearly-30-jobs-abu-dhabi-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>, the closure of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>, and more. </p>

It’s a lengthy message from the EA team that comes with a few highlights as it attempts to win back fans who may have been turned off by the recent delay of Season 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/21/battlefield-6-contaminated-1769016546557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Contaminated Map First Look. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players want new maps, and BF Studios wants to deliver. We don’t know how many new maps will be included in Season 2, but the Labs blog post confirms the name of one of the new locations: Contaminated. The studio says that, in terms of size, it falls between Season 1 map Eastwood and launch map Mirak Valley, while also comparing it to Battlefield 1’s St. Quentin Scar and Battlefield V’s Arras.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries,” the post says of upcoming pre-release tests. “We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A first-look, work-in-progress image of the map (above) shows a rocky mountain battleground. Fog and forest both overlook what appears to be a small aircraft runway, with snipers perched between the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick out one defining feature from the new map with such a limited look, but BF Studios has something a little more familiar planned for the future. Buried in the “On the Horizon” section of the Labs blog post is the announcement that a “fan-favorite” Battlefield 4 map is set to arrive “in a future season.” That location is none other than launch map <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-4/Golmud_Railway"><u>Golmud Railway</u></a>, which, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more"><u>a few dedicated Reddit users let us know last year</u></a>, stands as not only one of the larger Battlefield 4 maps but one of the bigger Battlefield maps ever.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that Battlefield 6 has brought back maps before, with Operation Firestorm launching alongside the game itself in October. The wide-open desert area featured in the latest installment is actually a smaller version of the same map from Battlefield 3, so it’s unclear if Golmud Railway will receive the same treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, BF Studios says this fully rebuilt version of the Battlefield 4 map will be the biggest Battlefield 6 multiplayer map yet, promising to “preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project,” the developer says. “Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a recent tweak to jet gameplay, fans of air combat have also been hoping to see more love in Battlefield 6. To help meet their desires, BF Studios used the Labs post to confirm upcoming tests will include the rumored return of the AH-6 Little Bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see the compact helicopter back in Season 2 at an unspecified point in time, with things like the previously promised air radar also set for Labs testing soon. Also still in the cards is a solo queue for REDSEC battle royale, though BF Studios says the long-desired option is continuing as “internal and exploratory” testing. There’s no word on when the mode could come to Labs or if it will ever make its way to the public version of Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield global community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/2014006687280091437?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> with more information about how BF Studios will continue to roll out testing for new content. Much of what was detailed today has no firm release date, but Labs players can go hands-on with at least some of the new content, including Contaminated, “as soon as this Friday.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Alongside that, we want to ensure more ongoing and meaningful action is taken on your feedback - Battlefield Labs will be the conduit for that,” Johnson said. “Things may take time, and we appreciate your patience, but what is in store is going to be a great collaboration moment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’s found itself in a bit of a bind heading into 2026, with players taking to social media to beg for new content as BF Studios works to deliver its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>delayed Season 2 come February 17</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

It turns out, a lot can change in four years. And here I am again, back on my tropical island paradise, playing through another big free addition – and a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of one of my favourite Switch games.</p>
<p>But wait, what does this mean for Animal Crossing’s future? We’re almost six years into New Horizons’ life with no sign of a new game in the series to come. The announcement <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">back in October 2025</a> filled me with a mix of excitement and worry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-animal-crossing-on-switch-2-has-me-equal-parts-buzzing-and-baffled">just like Jim</a>, because, yay, more Animal Crossing to lose my life to!

<p>Months later, and after a week of decorating hotel rooms, putting together a LEGO-themed nook in my basement, and contemplating terraforming part of my island all over again, I’m a lot less conflicted. In fact, I’m happy to wait for a brand new Animal Crossing, because in a few years' time, it might be the perfect game to experience with my daughter.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7518f7e26c2ea"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Quinn's birthday" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7518f7e26c2ea/animal-crossing-new-horizons-quinns-birthday.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, in 2026, I’m going to become a parent. This has added a whole new layer to how I think about video games. Both my husband and I had parents or relatives who were also into games, who encouraged us to pick up and play and experience the magic of the medium. Now the two of us are talking hypotheticals about which <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> our child should play first, or how we can use video games to teach her about life and love and empathy.</p>
<p>I knew I was expecting a child when the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition were announced, and I was hit with this strange realisation: New Horizons just seems to be there whenever my life is changing.</p>
<p>I don’t need to remind people of 2020, but I’ve found myself slipping back into the familiar rhythms of island life multiple times: when the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">DLC</a> dropped in 2021, I was looking for a new job; in 2023, I started a brand new island as I was packing up my life to move across the Atlantic. And now I’m back again ahead of parenthood.</p>
<p>It’s still the perfect reprieve from everything going on in the outside world, but with our impending new addition, it’s made me rethink how I play Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I couldn’t help but recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_6_things_my_three-year-old_taught_me_about_video_games_via_animal_crossing">Roland’s experience with the beginnings of New Horizon with his own child</a>, and the prospect of getting to see my daughter’s face as she helps me play through a completely new game is wonderful.</p>

<p>I’m so used to the mechanics and the way Animal Crossing rolls, but New Horizons is easily the most complex entry so far, even with the handful of QoL updates 3.0 brought with it. There’s no way I could imagine throwing a young child into the game, <em>especially</em> on an island I’ve poured hundreds of hours into. Does she really want me to explain why the museum is surrounded by Japanese-themed decorations, or why I live next to the Able Sisters?</p>
<p>The next game is unlikely to scale back that much, but what it does offer is a chance for a fresh start on an experience that both parent and child will be jumping into, together, for the first time. I can’t really think of anything better than that.</p>
<p>Usually when I play Animal Crossing, I’m a bit of a min-maxer. I like making money, so I’ll spend hours upon hours fishing, catching bugs, trying to farm scorpions and tropical bugs on Mystery Islands. I’ve also been playing this series for 23 years, importing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">the original</a> from North America because I desperately wanted to experience this cosy little life as a kid. I’ve never looked back.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7a11a7c3235da"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition 3.0 Update aurora" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a11a7c3235da/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-3-0-update-aurora.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As a result of this feverish love of the series, the slow-life aspect has been somewhat compounded in recent years, so a new game is the chance for me to reset the way I play. I'm guilty of time-travelling and scouring the internet for turnip prices, but now I'm side-eyeing those decisions. I don’t want to do this with my kid. I want to play the game the way <em>she</em> wants me to, and she’ll be the one calling the shots. She will be the reason I’m playing – if that’s what she wants.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t the <em>most</em> child-friendly series given how much there is to do and how much text there is, but my aim would be to act as a guide for my daughter while she delights in designing her own characters or she giggles at the animalese voices. It’ll be a safe haven she gets to design with the help of her parents, not just a digital world she can watch enviously as I mow my way through progression.</p>
<p>Hypothetical thinking is dangerous, I know, and there are many things I can’t predict: for one, she might not like video games at all. She might get bored or frustrated, or she might simply prefer other activities. The world is her oyster. Plus, we might get a new Animal Crossing game in a year — you never know! — and I don’t think a baby would understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>But I’m no longer clamouring for the future, or a faster release schedule. New Marios, Zeldas, and Animal Crossings are nice and all, but you know what’s better? Sharing those experiences with someone you love unconditionally and watching them form their own loves, thoughts, and opinions of those experiences.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>The focus is now on open world and live service games</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Given its lengthy, troubled development period, it will probably not come as any surprise to you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> have announced today that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has been cancelled. This comes as part of a <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">broader restructure at the company</a>, which will apparently focus on what they call five "specialised creative houses" to "reclaim creative leadership and restore sustainable growth."
</p>
<p>
Alongside the Prince of Persia remake, Ubisoft have also cancelled development on five other games, three of them apparently being completely new, and one being a mobile title. Seven other games they have in the works have been internally delayed as well. Details about these games are next to none, but the general idea behind this move is that Ubisoft want to focus on open world and live service games.
</p>
<p>
It also appears that more layoffs may be in Ubisoft's future too. We already knew that their Halifax studio is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">being shuttered</a>, but according to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-details-major-company-reset-6-games-canned-7-delayed-and-2-studios-closed/">VGC</a>, the company is also considering the sale of other assets. On top of this, CFO Frederick Duguet said, "There are some people who will be refocused on other big projects, and some may leave the company." An exact figure wasn't specified in terms of staff members being moved or laid off.
</p>
<p>
In terms of these five new "creative houses," one of them is Vantage Studios, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">the subsidiary partially owned by Tencent</a>, which will focus on Ubisoft's tentpole series like Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six. Others will handle series like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil (which suggests it's somehow still in development), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-dance">Just Dance</a>, and even Prince of Persia, so clearly Ubisoft still intends to do something with the series.
</p><p>
The official Prince of Persia Twitter account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121">shared a statement</a> with this to say of the cancellation: "While the project had real potential, we weren’t able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit. And, we didn’t want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents. Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise. Thank you for your passion, patience, and love for Prince of Persia."
</p>
<p>
Solidarity with all those affected by the restructuring.

              <p><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>, Riot Games’ free-to-play </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> fighting game, released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles yesterday after roughly 18 months of closed beta tests. While it’s too early to comment on the overall quality of </span><i><span>2XKO’s</span></i><span> gameplay, PlayStation 5 players aren’t too impressed with its performance.</span></p> <p><span>After roughly 18 months of closed betas and “Alpha Lab” playtests, Riot Games has finally released its beginner-friendly, free-to-play (but microtransaction-heavy) fighting game </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>in full. There’s no critical consensus regarding </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span> yet. At launch there aren’t even <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/2xko/">any reviews of the console version</a>.&nbsp; B</span><span>ut I sunk a couple of hours into it this morning and can confirm that it’s still just as good as it was during the last closed beta.</span></p>

 <p><span>Little caveat there: I played on PC. </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>has technically been available on PC in early access since October 7, 2025, but only officially launched on Xbox Series S/X and PS5 on January 20. This is relevant because, according to the numerous posts that have popped up on the r/2XKO subreddit over the past 24 hours, the PS5 version of the game has a few performance-related issues.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.

 <p><span>“I’m not having FPS drops (though I’m on PS5 Pro), but the screen tearing is horrendous,” writes user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0t6r6l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>trugay</span></a><span>. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen on a console title. It makes this a fairly disappointing release. I’m enjoying the game and its mechanics, but this is really dampening the experience.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Over on Twitter, user </span><a href="https://x.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644"><span>Jfcdoomblade</span></a><span> uploaded a clip of the FPS drops in action and stated that “2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.”</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, I was unable to find any similar complaints from Xbox Series users. In fact, the only Xbox-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qir40k/having_a_blast_on_xbox_so_fun/"><span>thread</span></a><span> I could find was from one user gushing about how much fun they’re having.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note here that the screen tearing issue can’t be properly replicated through recorded footage, as screen tearing occurs through the monitor used to display the image. PS5 owners have theorized that the screen tearing issue in </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>may only occur when the game is played on a 120hz screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re confused as to why the same issue isn’t popping up for PC players who are using 120hz monitors, PS5 users have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0tfyys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>further theorized</span></a><span> that this may be due to an issue with how v-sync has been implemented on the PlayStation 5 version of </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 will be pitting two space marine chapters – the Blood Ravens and the Dark Angels – against the terrifying Necrons, with an assist from their cyborg compatriots in the Adeptus Mechanicus. But while they all brood and scheme and recite litanies, the Orks will be literally crash-landing into the middle of it all in search of good fights and making gory memories. We got to try out a swathe of units and new campaign mechanics, and if there's one idea that seems to define the faction in this new RTS, it's this: "Make it bigger!"</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The WAAAGH!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks wouldn't really be the Orks without the Waaagh! mechanic, representing their entire culture and warfare ethos of enthusiastic mayhem. It's been represented in various ways across many 40K games, but in Dawn of War 4, it's about as straightforward as the Orks themselves. Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons. Or even other Orks! Filling the bar will unlock tactical abilities, but also higher-tier units and upgrades.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 – Ork Faction Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks are very much a snowball faction, King Art Games told us. You kind of want to throw everything at the wall, sometimes literally, and let that chaos fuel your war machine. An Ork boy who's not mixing it up with the enemy is one who isn't earning his keep. And Ork units tend to be pretty cheap to replace, so you might as well box select them and send them to the front if they're just standing around.</p><p>Waaagh! is a bar that fills up from having lots of units on the field and, of course, from killing lots of humies and Necrons.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork squads gain veterancy pretty quick, so even losing experienced squads isn't the end of the world. They're usually not as potent on a one-for-one basis as a fully veteran Space Marine squad, but they can reach peak performance sooner. And one of my favorite parts of the whole faction is that some of the Orks have veterancy upgrades that actually add more models to a squad. So a fresh batch of Boyz might only consist of a handful, but once the Waaagh! really gets rolling, it'll look like a proper horde.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you have enough violent fervor saved up, you can Unleash the Waaagh!, which gives all of your units a frantic offensive power increase for a limited time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Scrap 'em!</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ork buildings are very much an extension of this playstyle. They're relatively cheap and fast to construct, any Ork unit can build them, and every single one has some kind of little grot with a machine gun on it at least. There are no zoning laws here. Even Ork grocery stores and kindergartens are designed to be defensive turrets, apparently. So basically, you want to more or less barf buildings out across the entire map as you advance. Most of them aren't very durable, but if your opponent has to navigate through a valley of scrap piles that are all shooting at them, that's going to wear them down at the very least.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The core of an Ork army is still the melee Slugga Boyz and the ranged Shoota Boyz, filling out the front with durable but mostly expendable troops that want to outnumber the enemy if possible. When I really needed to hold the line, though, I opted for Beast Snagga Boyz, an even meaner, and slightly more expensive, melee option who can be equipped with mid-range shotguns. I guess you could think of these as the unhinged hillbillies to the Sluggas' rowdy football hooligans.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to a lot of my Orky triumphs, though, actually turned out to be cavalry. Squighog Boyz charge into the fight on the backs of terrifying, sharp-toothed squighogs that are great at finding an opening in an Imperial Guard defensive line. And once they're stuck into the trenches, well, those poor humies don't stand much of a chance. For a faction that is best known for mass frontal assaults, I quite enjoyed the more tactical playstyle that these mounted boyz enable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wurrboys add a caster option to the roster, while extra-expendable Gretchen and the slightly bulkier Mekboy keep your smoke-belching war machines in working order. The Stormboyz are another option for dealing with hardened defenses, using what is really more of a rocket with some straps on it than a proper jetpack to leap over the top of bunkers and sandbags.</p><p>It would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without the Orks.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of other, more specialized tools in the Ork arsenal, too. Flash Gitz are great at punching through the armor on hapless Space Marines or the various vehicles and mechanical monstrosities the other factions field. The stompy Deff Dread can mix it up with melee superunits that would tear the average ork to shreds. And when you really just need to make a hole in something at whatever cost, Bomb Squigs seem more than happy to sacrifice themselves to take out harder targets and enemy structures.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Orks have never been my main faction in 40K, but it would be hard to imagine Dawn of War without them. They love a challenge, and rejoice in the idea of finding the biggest and strongest foes to test their mettle against, and I can respect that. And I had a lot of fun messing around with them, even if they won't be my first choice on your average day. Especially seeing my squads of Boyz swell in numbers as they levelled up felt thematically appropriate and fantastically satisfying.And of course, we can't forget the centerpiece of every Ork incursion: the Warboss. Dawn of War 4 has two of them, actually, with fairly different playstyles and campaign goals. You can learn more about them in our hands-on Ork campaign preview coming later in the month. Until then, you can get a look at the boyz in all their glory in the Ork faction CGI trailer, and learn more about the development of Dawn of War 4 with our developer interviews, all part of this month's IGN First.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-hands-on-deep-dive-with-the-ork-faction-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Remake looks to have been delayed.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has announced a sweeping company restructure that will result in the cancelation of six games including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</a>, and a delay to a further seven titles. Two Ubisoft studios will be closed completely as a result of the changes, while others are subject to further layoffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the half dozen games that have been fully scrapped, Ubisoft is only publicly naming one today — its long-awaited Sands of Time remake that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-remake-ubisoft-montreal">rebooted once already</a>. Three of the canceled games were new IPs, while one was a mobile game. Ubisoft's core focus going forward, the company has said, will be on open-world games and live-services.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No specific detail has been given of the seven titles that Ubisoft has delayed, either, though this number does include the unannounced game once set for launch before March 31 that is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">widely expected to be the company's Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remaster</a>. This will now launch in the coming financial year — so before March 31, 2027.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Stockholm will fully close as a result of the changes, having previously collaborated on Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, alongside mobile studio Ubisoft Halifax (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shuts-down-assassins-creed-rebellion-developer-halifax-studio-just-weeks-after-it-unionized">news of which first broke last week</a>). "Restructurings" have also taken place at Ubisoft offices in Abu Dhabi, at Trials studio RedLynx and at Massive, home to The Division. In addition, all teams will be required to return to in-office working five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We went through a thorough review of projects across December [and] January, with the current market evolution in mind — which is consistently more selective," Ubisoft's chief financial officer Frederick Duguet told IGN today. "You've seen the last quarter showing a never-before-seen level of competition. Competition and selection is here to stay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you are coming in number one, number two, with great content quality in a given segment, then you can have a very strong reward in terms of player reception and financial performance. That's what really informed our pipeline review. We selected what would be the best projects to put the Creative Houses in the best position to succeed in that market."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a sign of how vast an impact Ubisoft expects this restructure to have, as well as how badly it feels it is needed, the company has scrapped its previous guidance for the full financial year and now expects net bookings of around €1.5 billion ($1.75 billion), down by €330 million ($386 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Via a statement shared with IGN, Ubisoft said this huge reduction reflected changes to the company's upcoming release pipeline following the implementation of its updated development roadmap, and the decision to "postpone negations on certain partnerships" in the context of its new operating model.</p><p>"Competition is here to stay..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the shakeup comes as Ubisoft finally lays out how its global development might is to be split into five "Creative Houses" that will operate as independent business units — the first of which was detailed last year. The previously-established Vantage Studios now encompasses the development of Ubisoft's three biggest brands (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six) and soon the remaining divisions will take on themed groups that cover the company's remaining franchises.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 2 will be dedicated to shooters, and look after The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. Creative House 3 will focus on live experiences, including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative House 4 will feature narrative driven and fantasy-orientated series including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil (yes, seemingly Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 still lives). Finally, Creative House 5 will center on family and casual gaming, including Just Dance, Uno, Hasbro, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, and Invincible: Guarding the Globe.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Prince of Persia: The Complete Playlist</h3><p>Here's the entire Prince of Persia gameography, from Mechner/Broderbund's original to Ubisoft's many sequels.

            <guid>1412248</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="6b57afb47ef56"><a title="AC Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b57afb47ef56/ac-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft has announced a major organisational restructure to refocus its initiatives and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>In a press release, the company confirmed that it plans to "close several studios" and "continue restructuring throughout the Group" in order to achieve its goals. It reconfirmed the closure of its Halifax studio, along with restructuring at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. It will also reinforce a working structure of five days in office environments, which will be supported by yearly allowances to work from home.</p>
<p>Naturally, news of studio closures also means that several games – six, to be precise – have been discontinued. This includes <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/prince_of_persia_the_sands_of_time_remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> along with three brand new IPs and a mobile game. Yes, we know that totals five, so who knows what the sixth is.</p>
<p>On the flip side, seven unspecified titles will be granted additional development time to ensure they meet the quality standards set by Ubisoft. One of these games, originally scheduled to launch in fiscal year 2026, has been pushed to fiscal year 2027.</p>
<p>Ubisoft will primarily focus on open-world games and 'Games as a Service' titles, which it says will be supported by "targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI." Good lord...</p>
<p>Starting from April, Ubisoft's operating model will centre around five "creative houses", each of which will be wholly responsible for the games it creates, including development and marketing. Each house will focus on specific genres, and the general outline looks a little like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>CH1 - Flagship (<strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong>, <strong>Far Cry,</strong> <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>)</li>
<li>CH2 - Shooters/Competitive titles (<strong>The Division</strong>, <strong>Ghost Recon</strong>, <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>)</li>
<li>CH3 - Live Service Games (<strong>For Honor</strong>, <strong>The Crew</strong>, <strong>Riders Republic</strong>, <strong>Brawlhalla</strong>, <strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong>)</li>
<li>CH4 - Narrative Adventures (<strong>Anno</strong>, <strong>Might &amp; Magic</strong>, <strong>Rayman</strong>, <strong>Prince of Persia</strong>, <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>)</li>
<li>CH5 - Family Friendly Games (<strong>Just Dance</strong>, <strong>Idle Miner Tycoon</strong>, <strong>Ketchapp</strong>, <strong>Hungry Shark</strong>, <strong>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</strong>, <strong>Uno</strong>, <strong>Hasbro</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Ubisoft will be taking the next three years or so to completely refocus its portfolio and effectively reallocate its resources.</p>

With the reorganization, Ubisoft will focus its efforts on big open worlds and live service games and is making “accelerated investments” in “player-facing Generative AI.”</p><p>In the new structure, which goes into effect in April, Ubisoft’s new operating model will “be structured around five Creative Houses,” supported by a “Creative Network providing development resources, shared Core Services and a reshaped HQ.” The brands under each Creative House, which include the studio announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/789721/ubisoft-vantage-studios-subsidiary-assassins-creed-far-cry">last year</a> dedicated to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>, will be focused on different genres:</p><div><blockquote><p>CH1 (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands;</p><p>Brands: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p><p>CH2 dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences;</p><p>Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell</p><p>CH3 designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences;</p><p>Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones</p><p>CH4 dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes;</p><p>Brands including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil</p><p>CH5 focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games.</p><p>Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, Hasbro</p></blockquote></div><p>Ubisoft is also developing four new franchises, including <em>March of Giants</em>, the MOBA Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844729/amazon-offloads-a-moba-to-ubisoft-as-part-of-its-gaming-pivot">offloaded last year</a> after its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808332/amazon-gaming-layoffs-mmo-aaa-first-party-games">recent gaming reprioritization</a>.

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly.

But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise. And fair enough—name a beloved cartoon character that didn’t look all kinds of weirdly different in their first form than the version we got used to.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has announced that its new operating model features 5 Creative Houses, supported by a Creative Network. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft has just announced a major restructure to the organization, with the new model focusing on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences</a>. This has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the Prince of Persia Remake</a> and several other titles. Moreover, several studios will be closed, and layoffs are expected across the company. Check out how the new model will function below. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-5-creative-houses-are-built-on-a-decentralized-model">Ubisoft’s 5 Creative Houses Are Built on a Decentralized Model </h2>



<p>As revealed in the latest <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, the new operating model for Ubisoft features 5 Creative Houses and will start from April 2026. It is supported by a Creative Network that will provide development resources, shared Core Services, and a reshaped HQ. The new decentralized model will lead to 3 significant changes: </p>



<ul>
<li>Firstly, the game development and go-to-market functions will be combined for a gamer-centric approach, and they will be fully responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction. </li>



<li>The new Creative Houses have been shaped by distinctive genres, which are led by “high-profile, incentivized teams with a unique set of expertise in those genres.”</li>



<li>Lastly, the teams will have full financial ownership and account for economic performance.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-s-creative-houses-have-been-divided-by-genre">Ubisoft’s Creative Houses Have Been Divided by Genre</h2>



<ul>
<li>The first Creative House is the newly formed Vantage Studios, which will work on Ubisoft’s largest established franchises, aiming to turn them into “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>“: Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. </li>



<li>Creative House 2 will focus on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences: The Division, Ghost Recon, and Splinter Cell. </li>



<li>The third Creative House will be centered around live experiences: For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, and Skull &amp; Bones. </li>



<li>Creative House 4 will feature immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes: Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, and Beyond Good &amp; Evil. </li>



<li>The last and final Creative House will be dedicated to casual and family-friendly titles: Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno, and Hasbro. </li>
</ul>



<p>On top of these, Ubisoft is working on 4 new IPs, including March of Giants. The division of these IPs across the Creative Houses will be revealed at a later stage. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Ubisoft is canceling six games in development, including its troubled remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. The publisher is also delaying seven other games in its development pipeline.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-cancelled-6-games-including-the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>, Ubisoft held a call with select media to announce it is undergoing a “major organisational, operational and portfolio reset.” It plans to accomplish this via three pillars: new operating model, a “refocused portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap," and “the rightsizing of the organization.”</p><p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">press release</a> states:</p><p>“Ubisoft's strategic decision to undertake this major reset is driven by the continued shift toward a persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape, combined with the growing challenge for publishers to create brands in a context of higher costs. Nevertheless, when successful, exceptional AAA content has more financial potential than ever. While last years’ progress with its production processes translated into improved levels of quality for Ubisoft games in 2025, today’s market environment requires that the Group step-changes how it is organized and operates with a view to delivering exceptional games quality at more competitive costs.”</p><p>This new operating model will center on five creative houses, each responsible for various Ubisoft IPs and possessing expertise in distinct genres (including its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">new subsidiary Vantage Studios</a>). This simplified structure is designed to facilitate execution of the company’s strategy to focus more on “Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.” This new organizational structure will begin in early April.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdhrdKu1SCA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>After conducting a thorough portfolio review, it was decided that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake will be canceled. The game was<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/10/ubisoft-remakes-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time"> first announced</a> in September 2020 with a 2021 launch date and was originally helmed by Ubisoft's Indian studios in Mumbai and Pune. After suffering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/02/05/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely">a pair of delays</a>, development shifted to Ubisoft Montreal in 2022. During Ubisoft Forward in 2024, The Sands of Time remake <a href="https://gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2024/06/10/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-is-coming-in-2026">resurfaced with a 2026 launch window</a>. Its most recent update came in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/16/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-shows-signs-of-life-with-small-update">June 2025</a> with a social media post reconfirming the game's continued development.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has also ceased development of four unannounced games, which consisted of three new IPs and a mobile title, stating these titles, along with Prince of Persia, “do not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria”.</p><p>Additionally, Ubisoft is delaying seven unannounced games “in order to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” One of the games was slated to launch in Fiscal Year (FY) 26 and will now arrive during FY 27. While we don’t know what these projects are yet, one of them is reportedly the heavily rumored (but not officially confirmed) remake of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, which appeared on PEGI’s website in December as<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-has-been-listed-on-pegis-website/"> Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>. Ubisoft also states it has four new IPs in development, including March of Giants, an upcoming MOBA it <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-march-of-giants">acquired from Amazon Games</a> last month.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft has been undergoing a restructuring over the past year following disappointing launch performances for some of its recent AAA titles, such as Star Wars Outlaws. It created its Vantage Studios subsidiary in 2025 to oversee the Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry franchises. Earlier this month, it <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-shuts-down-recently-unionized-halifax-studio">shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/13/ubisoft-proposes-to-lay-off-55-employees-at-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-developer">proposed layoffs to The Division developer Massive Entertainment</a> after conducting similar restructurings at its <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-redlynx-says-up-to-60-positions-could-be-cut-in-restructuring-proposal">RedLynx</a> and Abu Dhabi studios.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-cancels-prince-of-persia-remake-and-5-other-games-as-part-of-major]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has closed two studios and cancelled six projects - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games.
</p>
<p>
The moves are part of what Ubisoft calls a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset" as it looks to respond to a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape". The restructuring will see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.
</p>
<p>
The first major impact of this significant organisational shift is the closure of Ubisoft's Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, with "restructuring" also confirmed for the publisher's Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive teams. It's unclear how many employees will lose their jobs as result of these changes, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">IGN reports</a> the move is also being accompanied by a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week, albeit with an annual allowance of remote-working days.
</p>
<p>
Amid this major shake-up, Ubisoft has confirmed the cancellation of six in-development games it says "do not meet the new enhanced quality [and] more selective portfolio prioritisation criteria". Four of these titles have never been announced (three being new IPs and one a mobile game), and the only cancelled title it has explicitly named is its embattled Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and which has suffered multiple delays in the years since then. When last we heard of the remake, Ubisoft had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">narrowed its release window</a> down to between 1st January and 31st March 2026. As such, its cancellation is unexpected.
</p><p>
Alongside these cancellations, Ubisoft is delaying seven  unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Notably, this includes the unannounced game widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a> - which will now launch in Ubisoft's next financial year, starting April 2026, rather than the current one it was previously announced for. All this has lead Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.
</p>
<p>
"These measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "The portfolio refocus will have a significant impact on the Group's short term financial trajectory, particularly in fiscal years 2026 and 2027, but this reset will strengthen the Group and enable it to renew with sustainable growth and robust cash generation. Ubisoft is entering a new phase – one designed to reclaim creative leadership and build value for players and stakeholders over the long term."

      <p>Every new season of anime always asks the beleagured adult anime fan to sort the wheat from the chaff, or the new josei from the glut of shonen isekai slop. As the most <a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love/"><u><em>Nana</em>-pilled blogger</u></a> you’ll ever have the pleasure to read, this is my burden each season.&nbsp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josei_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Josei</u></a> is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Djo_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shojo </u></a>what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>seinen </u></a>is to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dnen_manga?ref=aftermath.site"><u>shonen</u></a>; it's an adult-oriented genre marketed primarily toward older women rather than men. Likewise, their narratives leave a helluva lot more to stew on with their heavier themes than your ragamuffin anime. While I don’t often get my josei prayers answered, this <a href="https://gizmodo.com/there-is-almost-too-much-anime-to-watch-this-month-2000704345?ref=aftermath.site"><u>year's crop of anime</u></a> has yielded promising fruits through a new Crunchyroll show I’ve been digging called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_with_Witch?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Journal With Witch</u></em></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DX6mmkoByyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Journal with Witch | Official Trailer | Crunchyroll"></iframe></figure><p><em>Journal With Witch</em>, originally created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoko_Yamashita?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Tomoko Yamashita</u></a> and animated by studio Shuka, is a drama set at a deeply emotional point in the lives of two women. The first is Makio, a relatively successful 35-year-old author whose relationship with her sister, Minori, was so toxic that they cut off all ties. That decision rears its ugly head in the worst possible way when Makio is called in to identify the bodies of her sister and her husband, who died in a car accident. Although Makio doesn’t appear at any stage of the grieving cycle after identifying her sister, that act leads to a sudden reunion with the other woman at the center of this story: Asa, her 15-year-old niece, whom she hasn’t seen in years. Their tragic meeting triggers a new relationship between the two, as they wrestle with mourning the loss and figuring out how to continue together, making up for what the other lacks to get there.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s got me so geeked about <em>Journal With Witch</em> isn’t the big sads in store from its premise but how it showcases its two heroines’ mourning without ever letting the story collapse into agonizing wallowing. This tonal balance is lampshaded with pretty stark clarity from its opening scene.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than opening with their first meeting, the show jumps to some unknown point in the future of their relationship. Here, we see Makio clanking away at her littered desk, writing, while Asa hums a tune nearby as she does the dishes. Makio interrupts Asa with a deadpan request for her to sing a different Justin Bieber bop, prompting Asa to belt out the first syllables of “Baby” before the story abruptly snaps back to the beginning. It’s a cute, disarming moment that makes the show’s thesis plain. This anime is just as much about the relationship these two forge together as it is about how they cope with the death that inadvertently casts them into each other’s orbit.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Shuko</span></figcaption></figure><p>This framing also clarifies who these women are at the outset by giving viewers a peek at where they’ll ultimately wind up in their relationship. Asa, for instance,&nbsp; is a girl who just wants to graduate middle school without being labeled as “the girl whose parents died.” Makio, on the other hand, is an isolated writer who—at least as far as she’ll admit—feels nothing upon hearing that her sister and brother‑in‑law passed away, on account of their relationship having been FUBAR for years. Yet Makio never projects her own hard feelings toward her sister onto Asa. Instead, she allows her niece to feel her emotions, however big or small they may be, treating them as wholly her own and never something to be ashamed of.</p><p>Throughout the show, <em>Journal With Witch</em> traces how Makio and Asa gradually become a safe harbor for each other, even though both arrive in this new arrangement carrying their own emotional baggage. Makio, for instance, routinely offers Asa blunt, matter‑of‑fact guidance—an unexpected role for someone who’s otherwise shy and who never loved Asa’s mother. Makio suggests that Asa journal her feelings in a diary with full confidence that Makio will never read what she writes. <em>Journal With Witch</em> also grounds their collective healing in the mundanity of routine as they re-establish a new normal: low‑effort meals, slow walks, and long conversations about the finer points of literary techniques can work as a way to cope with loss.&nbsp;</p><p>While it's too early to see what impact Asa has on Makio, who is still guarded around her toxic sister’s child, it’ll surely be a watershed moment for both of them whenever they grow close enough to cross that bridge.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLZhRSC1gjs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia Teaser PV |July 2026"></iframe></figure><p>My only wish is that the rest of the anime seasons in 2026, save for Science Saru’s<a href="https://x.com/sciencesaru/status/2006380076749734037?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u> <em>Jaadugar: A Witch in Mongolia</em></u></a>, bring about a resurgence of josei in the anime landscape. Lord knows we could use a few fewer stories about bombast and more about pensive reflections on the human condition and the relationships we make and leave behind. And from the few episodes I’ve seen of <em>Journal With Witch</em>, it's starting to feel like the josei era is so back. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has cancelled <strong>six games and delayed seven more </strong>as part of a "<strong><em>major reset"</em></strong> for the company. The cancelled projects include the long-awaited and much-troubled <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, while the other cancelled projects were all unannounced titles. One of them was an unannounced mobile title, and out of the remaining four, three were brand new IPs. While the seven delayed projects reportedly include the unannounced <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release sent to Wccftech that outlines how Ubisoft is entirely reorganizing itself into "<em><strong>five creative houses</strong>," </em>all built to support a new strategic focus for the company. It adds that the previously announced closure of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/"><strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong>,</a> layoffs at <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/"><strong>RedLynx</strong>,</a> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Massive Entertainment</a></strong>, and the now-confirmed closure of <strong>Ubisoft Stockholm</strong> are all part of this reset.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, Ubisoft announces a major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset designed to reclaim its creative leadership, regain agility and drive a sharp rebound, renewing the Group's trajectory toward sustainable growth and robust cash generation</em>," the press release begins.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ubisoft-Creative-Houses-Restructure.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ubisoft's new Creative Houses structure. Image credit: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>The new operating model will further empower the execution of the Group's strategy, centered on Open World Adventure and GaaS-native experiences, supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization and cutting-edge technology, including accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.</em>"</p>



<p>It's quite the shift, especially for fans who were waiting on the Sands of Time Remake, which has gone from <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-rumored-to-release-in-january-2026/">being rumoured to release sometime in early 2026,</a> to not at all. As to why it was cancelled, the company claimed that the remake, and the five other cancelled projects did "<em>not meet the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level</em>."</p>



<p>As for the seven delayed games, while Ubisoft doesn't name any of them as they are all officially unannounced, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mcx4n6jqds2c">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, one of the delayed projects is the long-rumoured Black Flag remake. The seven projects are being given more time "<em>to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation</em>." They're also getting updated revenue expectations, to go along with the delays.</p>



<p>The five creative houses break down all of Ubisoft's IPs into their own categories. The first is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/"><strong>Vantage Studios</strong>, its new <strong>Tencent-backed</strong> subsidiary,</a> which houses the <strong>Assassin's Creed, Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong> franchises. The rest of the creative houses don't have official titles other than 'Creative House' two through five, though each of them will have "<em>dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability.</em>" Each creative house will also have "<em>end-to-end</em> <em>responsibility for its portfolio, overseeing the full creative and brand scope from development to publishing (brand, marketing and sales go-to-market strategy).</em>"  </p>



<p>The second creative house will focus on "<em>cooperative shooter experiences</em>" and be the home for <strong>The Division, Ghost Recon, </strong>and <strong>Splinter Cell</strong>. The third creative house is focused on <em>"a roster of select, sharp live experiences</em>," including <strong>For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla,</strong> and <strong>Skull &amp; Bones.</strong></p>



<p>The fourth creative house is dedicated to "<em>immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes</em>," and it'll be the home for <strong>Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia,</strong> and <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong>. Finally, the fifth creative house will be its home for "<em>casual and family-friendly games</em>," including <strong>Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon, Ketchapp, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Globe, Uno,</strong> and <strong>Hasbro.</strong> Ubisoft also confirmed that part of this restructure includes the development of <strong>four new IPs</strong>, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/">the recently acquired <strong>March of Giants</strong>.</a></p>



<p>"<em>On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands</em>," began chief executive officer <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>, in a press release. "<em>On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>To put the Creative Houses in the best conditions to succeed, we decided to refocus our portfolio with a meaningfully revised 3-year roadmap and accelerate our cost reductions initiatives to rightsize the organization</em>...<em>While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term</em>."</p>

<p>According to Ubisoft, the project's cancellation is part of what the studio refers to as a "major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset" which is "designed to reclaim [Ubisoft's] creative leadership" and renew the publisher's "trajectory towards sustainable growth".</p><p>Said initiative will consist of three pillars, namely a new operating model, a "refocused portfolio", and the "rightsizing" of the company as a whole. Naturally, this reorganization will also include increased investment in generative AI.</p><p>Ubisoft also reiterates its commitment to restructuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">into Creative Houses</a>, each of which will steward a set of the studio's IPs, including Vantage Studios, which will oversee <em>Assassin's Creed </em>and <em>Far Cry</em>.</p><p><em>Prince of Persia</em>, meanwhile, will fall under the watchful eye of Creative House 4, which, according to Ubisoft, is "dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes". That's also the Creative House that will look after <em>Rayman</em>, which Ubisoft says it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="781293f6-dc00-4c8e-aa6f-0f302cc5b8b6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently working on</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Creative House 4 is also responsible for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, and Ubisoft doesn't say anything about the status of the long-awaited <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, although if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c16fa0c-81d9-45f0-9b15-3df2fe6adb4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recent job listings</a> are to be believed, the project is still in development.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what this new restructuring effort means for Ubisoft and for those who play its games.

<p>I do wonder if Shredders will have the same hold over me on other maps. Despite several large halls, Stella Montis is a claustrophobic map, largely made up of winding corridors. When you come across a Shredder, you are trapped inside with it and its cloud of shrapnel is an all-encompassing threat. Arc Raiders other maps are a mix of interior and exterior, and you are rarely far from an open space to flee to.</p><p>Obviously, this will all come down to placement. A Shredder mooching about in Dam Battleground's swamps won't offer much of a threat, but if you were to come across one on the platform of the train stations in Buried City, waiting to mulch you when you are moments away from safety… Well, that could be a different story.</p>
<p>In this way, a Shredder could become a much more deadly indoor threat than Pops and Fireballs, the ball-shaped robots that bomb around inside buildings. While a Pop's self-destruct and a Freiballs flamethrower can cause significant damage, they aren't as well armoured as a Shredder, nor able to put out quite as much damage.</p>
<p>Where Shredder's appearing on other maps may be extra threatening, is when they can act in tandem with exterior enemies. A Shredder can be an effective area denial tool for the Arc, pushing you to remain outdoors where a Bombardier has you in its sights. The quickest way out of danger when the artillery mech is attacking you is to seek shelter indoors. Working together, Shredders and Bombardiers could be deeply frustrating.</p>
<p>Watkins didn't say when Shredders would start cropping up in other maps, so you still have time to fill your inventory with heavy shields.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869</link>
            <guid>1412194</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The French publisher behind <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is planning <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">even more cuts</a>, delays, and pivots as part of a brutal new restructuring. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that a company-wide reset will include a new creative structure, “rightsizing of the organization,” and more investment in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <p>The latest shifts come <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">amid a challenging five-year stretch</a> for Ubisoft in which big blockbusters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> and <em>Far Cry 6</em> were few and far between while big bets like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>xDefiant</em> failed to pay off. In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">its January 21 earnings press release</a>, the company promised a “radically new value-creation model” based around a “more gamer-centric organization.” This will include “business units with faster, decentralized decision-making and a greater ability to quickly adapt to players’ expectations” and a “rightsized and more agile organization, delivering improved structural efficiencies over time.”</p>

 <p>A management consultant company like McKinsey &amp; Company couldn’t have written it better. For those not versed in 21st century corpo-speak, that means a slow disassembly of the global AAA factory that Ubisoft spent the 2010s building up and more studio closures and layoffs. The move will also include delays of many big games and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-2000661866">cancellation of others like the<em> Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake</a> that’s been in development for years. Ubisoft says it will double down on open-world games and games-as-a-service while boosting investments in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <h2>Ubisoft fragmented into “creative houses”</h2> <p>Instead of the integrated co-development model that has led the company to churn out massive games with armies of studios from around the world contributing to them, the new model suggests a series of siloes within the company based around individual IPs and genres. The first is a Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios that owns <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. The second will own <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em>. The third will own<em> For Honor</em>,<em> The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>,<em> Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. The fourth will own <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>,<em> Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>. The fifth will own<em>&nbsp;Just Dance</em>, <em>Idle Miner Tycoon</em>,<em> Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>, <em>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno<span>,</span></em> and Hasbro-branded games like <em>Hasbro Game Night</em>.</p>

 <p>“Each Creative House will benefit from dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability,” Ubisoft claims. “These leadership teams will include high-profile talent coming from the industry. They will be tasked with attracting and developing top-level, specialist talent, and supported by incentive schemes aligned with creative success, player engagement and long-term value creation.” Will that actually streamline things though, or just add a whole new layer of bureaucracy?</p>

 <h2>More closures, cuts, and layoffs</h2> <p>No restructuring is complete with out firings. The company cites recently announced closures of its Halifax mobile studio and Ubisoft Stockholm, as well as layoffs at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive. This is part of an ongoing $117 million cost reduction, but the company has now also committed to an additional $234 million of cuts over the next two years.</p> <p>“We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group,” CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed. “While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.” He’s also open to selling more IP and studios if buyers are interested.</p>

 <p>But even those not getting explicitly laid off will face tough choices as Ubisoft end most remote work. “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” the company wrote. While Ubisoft argues that it’s necessary to get its creative groove back, the policy will also likely lead to mass “quiet quitting” among those who can find a hybrid work schedule somewhere else.</p> <h2>Delays, delays, and more delays</h2> <p>This reset has basically exploded Ubisoft’s upcoming game release pipeline. Six games have been canceled outright. Outside of the <em>Sands of Time</em> remake, which was rumored to be coming early in 2026, the company ended development on five other games that didn’t meet quality standards. Those include “four unannounced titles,” of which three were “new IPs” and one was a “mobile title.” For those counting at home, that’s one game short of the total six that were canned. What’s the mystery cancelation?</p> <p>Ubisoft also delayed seven of its upcoming games “to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” The company didn’t clarify which of those are announced or unannounced, but did specify that one of the delays was an unannounced game planned for launch in the next two months, which indicates it may be the rumored remake of<em> Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>.</p>

 <p>Other big games that remain MIA are the next <em>Ghost Recon</em>, a multiplayer game called <em>Assassin’s Creed Invictus</em>, and, of course, <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>.</p> <h2>More gen AI NPCs?</h2> <p>Ubisoft revealed a lot of upcoming pain to shareholders on Wednesday, like a $386 million gross margin reduction for its current fiscal year ending March 31. So it’s hard to know whether the company’s tease of more gen AI investment is just an attempt to throw them a bone, or something it’s actually serious about as an exercise in “value creation” for gamers. The company promised “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p>

 <p>After failing to cash in on emerging technologies like cloud streaming and blockchain NFTs, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">promoted LLM chatbot NPCs at GDC 2024</a>. It then returned to the idea late last year with AI-powered squadmates in <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">a tech demo that looked very Tom Clancy-ish</a>. “Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,” Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> at the time. “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>Whether that value becomes real or stays imaginary, things seem likely to get tougher for Ubisoft before they get better.</p> <p><em>Update: 1/21/2026, 1:17 p.m. ET: Added more information, including about changing remote work policies.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Flag Remake Likely Delayed By Up To One Year]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/</link>
            <guid>1412188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft published a document earlier today bursting with information regarding an ongoing restructuring effort at the titanic gaming company. This document included an outline of the new Creative Houses that have been established to drive forward the development of various categories of games.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the release also came with news of layoffs, cancellations, and delays. The Prince of Persia remake has been shut down, and according to a somewhat vague statement, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake has likely been delayed by <strong>up to a year</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-flag-to-remain-in-port-for-a-while">Black Flag To Remain in Port for a While</h2>



<p>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag emerged in 2013 and is still widely considered one of the best games in franchise history. It plants players in the Caribbean at the height of the pirating buzz, giving them a ship, a crew, and a couple of assassins’ blades to boot. It remains unsurpassed in some areas, and the nature of the remake has been one of the most talked-about topics in gaming for years.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new release</a> published today by Ubisoft seems to contain critical information that fans who are waiting for the Black Flag remake will mourn:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In parallel, the Group will allocate additional development time to 7 games inorder to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation. This includes the unannounced title initially planned for FY26, that has been delayed to FY27.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>From what we know, the Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag remake is the <strong>only game </strong>that fits that criteria. Information published exclusively by Insider Gaming last year stated that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">set to be released this March</a>, before the end of FY26. The game also remains unannounced, which further aligns it with the description above.</p>



<p>As the delay is pushing the game back to FY27, it could be <strong>up to a year </strong>before it surfaces. Of course, that also means it could be as early as May or June, depending on how long the pushback is. That detail hasn’t been established by Ubisoft or Vantage Studios.</p>



<p>This blow to Ubisoft fans is joined by the news that three new and unannounced IPs were also cancelled, alongside an unrevealed mobile game. It’s not a good time for Ubisoft, but this is fast becoming par for the company’s course.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has announced a major restructuring, with a new operating model centered on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, supported by player-facing generative AI. </p>



<p>The news about Ubisoft’s organizational, operational, and portfolio reset was revealed, bringing bad news for fans. The restructuring has led to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the highly anticipated Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. Learn more about their new focus below.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-is-looking-to-create-a-more-gamer-centric-organization">Ubisoft is Looking to Create a ‘More Gamer-Centric’ Organization</h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Ubisoft’s significant reset has been prompted by a more selective AAA market, increased competition in the shooter genre, and the challenges publishers face in creating brands amid rising costs. This has resulted in a new value-creation model designed to make Ubisoft “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>The revamped Ubisoft model focuses on open-world adventures and a Games-as-a-Service (GaaS) approach, bolstered by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology. This advanced technology includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>



<p>Yves Guillemot, the CEO, has announced that the company will shift its focus to a new three-year roadmap aimed at achieving cost reductions. As a result of this decision, several games will be canceled, multiple studios will be closed, and layoffs will occur throughout the organization.</p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft wants Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six to become ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual billionaire brands</a>‘. Additionally, the former Assassin’s Creed Boss is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-million-damages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing the company</a>.

            <guid>1412179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has canceled the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake.</p>



<p>The decision comes as the company has announced <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a major restructuring</a> for the company. It also means five other games were cancelled, including three new IPs and a mobile game. </p>







<p>Ubisoft says that the cancelations were a result of the games not meeting “the new enhanced quality as well as more selective portfolio prioritization criteria at Group level.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-complete-ubisoft-restructure">A Complete Ubisoft Restructure</h2>



<p>The restructuring will see the company form five “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff-on-new-creative-houses-ubisoft-structure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creative houses</a>“, the first of which being the recently formed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vantage Studios</a>. That studio oversees the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises. </p>



<p>The other four creative houses will hold franchises like The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, Rayman, and others. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had reported</a> that the marketing plans for the game suggested a release in Mid-January. Even public company documents stated that the game was set to release by the end of the fiscal year.</p>



<p>The Sands of Time Remake was first announced in 2020, the game had an up and down development cycle. It was originally scheduled to release in January 2021 before being delayed to March 2021 in December 2020. Then, just a month before its March release, the game was delayed again to an unspecified date.</p>







<p>After that, Ubisoft went silent until it was announced that development was being moved to Ubisoft Montreal. When Ubisoft Montreal took over, development on the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was completely restarted</a>, which included a more ““realistic approach”. That included a graphical overall, new animations, and new mechanics for both combat and parkour.</p>



<p>In the announcement of the cancelation, the game’s developers said that although the game had potential, they never could reach the level of quality players deserved. Continuing the development, they said, <strong>“would have required more time and investment than we could responsibly commit.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Prince of Persia as a universe and a legacy continues to matter deeply to us, and this decision does not mean we’re stepping away from the franchise,”</strong> the team said.</p>
