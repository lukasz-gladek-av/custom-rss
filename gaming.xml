            <p>Celeste and Towerfall creators Extremely OK Games have announced the cancellation of their pixelart exploration platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earthblade">Earthblade</a>, in what studio director Maddy Thorson calls a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure". The decision to call it quits follows a bust-up within the development team, though this isn't, apparently, why they pulled the plug. Thorson and programmer Noel Berry have found making something "bigger and better" than Celeste exhausting, and have decided to work on smaller projects in future.</p><!--more-->
<p>Extremely OK <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-developers-next-game-is-called-earthblade">announced Earthblade back in 2021</a> with Celeste composer Lena Raine handling the soundtrack. A proper reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-devs-announce-gorgeous-new-platformer-earthblade">followed in 2022</a> with a smidgeon of plot information: the game would have seen you playing a "child of Fate", exploring a ruined planet. In March last year, Thorson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-creators-next-game-earthblade-wont-be-out-this-year-but-studio-assure-development-is-not-stagnant">blogged about development difficulties</a> but assured readers that the team were making progress. That brings us to today. It sounds like last year has been more complicated than she originally divulged.</p>
<p>Posting on Extremely OK's <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">website</a>, Thorson writes that a "fracture" formed last year between herself and Berry and co-founder Pedro Medeiros, who was Earthblade's art director and pixel/UI artist for Celeste and Towerfall.</p>
<p>"The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste, which we won't be detailing publicly - this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process," she explains. "We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game <a href="https://saint11.art/games/neverway/">Neverway</a>, which you should check out - we've played it and it's very promising."</p><p>Pedro's departure prompted Berry and Thorson to think hard about the status of Earthblade as a whole. "The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process," Thorson continues. "I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p>
<p>"But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."</p>
<p>Thorson is careful to spell out that Medeiros is not to blame for all this - his leaving simply created "the clarity to see that we have lost our way". She adds that "if you were excited about Earthblade and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren't the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn't welcome in any EXOK community."</p>
<p>As part of the cancellation, Thorson and Berry have parted ways with the other members of the Earthblade team - that's <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@amora">Amora</a>, <a href="http://kylepulver.com/">Kyle Pulver</a>, <a href="http://ikenfell.com/">Chevy Ray</a>, <a href="https://lena.fyi/">Raine</a> and sound design company <a href="https://powerupaudio.com/">Power-Up Audio</a> - though they hope to collaborate with them again.</p><p>"Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned from Earthblade, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects," Thorson goes on. "We're prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or TowerFall's inception." </p>
<p>She concludes that "scaling the core team up post-Celeste has ultimately been a failure, and that's okay. We gave it all we've got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."</p>
<p>I confess, I still haven't found time to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/celeste-review">magnificent-sounding</a> Celeste, but the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-towerfall-ascension">same-screen archery frenzy</a> of Towerfall was an office lunchbreak favourite when I worked at Future London. We'd gather round a monitor and mostly fall victim to our own arrows while hooting like baby elephants. Clearly the people who made that game are geniuses. I wish Extremely OK and the departing Earthblade team members better luck with their future creations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-much-do-you-think-it-would-cost-to-hire-agent-47.1089522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/agent-47-hitman-assassin-cost-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman</em>'s Agent 47 is the world's premier assassin, a man able to blend in with his surroundings at will, to get within arm's reach of the most secure and often most <em>dangerous </em>people on the planet. For much of his career he's been a man on a mission, but I have recently been wondering how much it would cost to hire him for a single job.</p><p>Me being able to entertain this possibility is canon! At the end of <em>Hitman 3</em> he and Diana essentially go off grid, leaving Providence behind to continue their work together as <a href="https://aftermath.site/hitman-freelancer-the-best-kind-of-hitman-is-more-hitman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers</a>.<a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Which I'm assuming doesn't pay as well as a staff job</a>, but if the gig economy has come for <em>us</em>, then it has come for Agent 47 as well.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like us</a>–and this is one of the only times I can make such a comparison, at least until I get balder–Agent 47 now has to worry about doing his own taxes, quoting for jobs and just generally living the small business hustle. His work pays (presumably) a lot more than ours does, so I’m sure he’ll be fine, but still, the leap from Providence employee to small business owner will be a challenge for him.</p><p>Which also means Agent 47's loss could be our gain. Prior to the events of <em>Hitman 3</em> he only worked in the shadows, the most lethal puppet on a string on the planet, a plaything of the powerful in their struggles against the...also powerful, but slightly more evil. If anyone else<em> </em>needed work done back then we'd have had to hire an assassin out of the phonebook, or Facebook Marketplace, or the dark web, or know a guy who knew a guy, all of which were just as likely to see us end up in prison as the target whacked.</p><p>These days though, Agent 47 is just out there for hire! He could, and presumably <em>would </em>(after repeated quicksaves and reloads, anyway) be able to do any job on the planet provided the pay was right.</p><p>Which leads me to wonder: <em>hypothetically speaking</em>, how much would a contract cost? Would Agent 47 charge per kill? Would he charge according to the complexity of the job? Would he scout out the target and present them with a series of quotes, escalating in cost owing to factors like difficulty and comedic value? Would the prospective clients get a certain number of "body in a storage closet" dumps for free, and exceeding that value would result in a surcharge per body?</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HiTMAN/comments/19bp6yz/how_much_do_you_think_it_costs_to_hire_47/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve seen people ask this before</a>, pointing to contract values from previous games and coming up with ballpark figures. <em>Silent Assassin</em>, released in 2002, has Agent 47 saying his standard rate is $100,000, while 2006’s <em>Blood Money</em> paid between $100,000 and $600,000 per job. That’s a while ago though, and Providence probably took a substantial cut of that, so it doesn’t really help with what his rates would be in 2025, particularly given the inflationary and cost-of-living crisis we’re all currently living through.&nbsp;</p><p>And while<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/uruno4/how_expensive_is_a_hitman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there are publicly available rates for actual hitmen</a>, I suspect that many of those are based on hitmen who were caught, and who also appear to be at the entry level of this particular market. The mafia hiring a guy to whack another guy outside a deli would not cost the same as a single career professional infiltrating an 18th century mansion, sneaking past 72 guards, hacking a security network and executing a renegade tech mogul.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, I have no idea how much it would cost to hire Agent 47! I just wonder sometimes, that's all.

<p>The Shopify Rebellion Game Changers roster, the reigning two-time champions, have made history. The women became the first GC team to qualify for a VALORANT Challengers event, after years of attempts.</p>



<p>The roster core that has dominated the women’s VALORANT scene has finally overcome their greatest obstacle on the path to their ultimate goal: the international VCT leagues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shopify-rebellion-makes-history">Shopify Rebellion Makes History</h2>



<p>While the Shopify Rebellion Game Changers team has dominated the GC circuit, they had always fallen short of advancing past qualifiers into Challengers. For VALORANT teams, the Challengers leagues are the path to the Ascension event, a regional tournament that determines who is promoted to the international VCT leagues.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-game-changers-vct-win/">winning their second Game Changers Championship in December</a>, Shopify were dealt a huge blow when their star Ava “florescent” Eugene signed with VCT EMEA team Apeks. In doing so, flor became the first Game Changers player to compete in VCT, but it left a big hole in the roster for Shopify to fill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just prior to the North American Challengers closed qualifier, Shopify found their replacement in Karnthida “dodonut” Chaisrakeo. In the closed qualifier, Shopify overcame dodonut’s former team, FlyQuest RED, before beating Funhaver to secure the third and final qualifier spot in NA Challengers.</p>







<p>For the Shopify Rebellion organization, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shopify-rebellion-merges-with-ludwig-and-cr1tikals-esports-organization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh off their merger with content creator stars Cr1TiKaL and Ludwig’s Moist Esports</a>, they will field two roster in NA Challengers, as their men’s roster returns after competing in the league last year. Organizations are permitted by Riot to field two teams in the same ecosystem, provided one of them is eligible to compete in Game Changers. The Shopify GC roster is the two-time champion of Game Changers, so they should be permitted to compete when the NA Challengers League stage one begins later this month.</p>

Extremely OK Games - the studio behind beloved 2018 platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a> - has announced the cancellation of its "2D explor-action" project Earthblade, calling the news a "huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure".
</p>
<p>
Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-dev-announces-new-game-earthblade-with-vibe-revealing-teaser-art-and-music">unveiled Earthblade back in 2021</a>, sharing some mood-setting teaser art and a musical snippet. A full reveal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-devs-show-first-look-at-earthblade">arrived a year and a half later</a>, offering an early glimpse of a side-scrolling platformer - blending elements of combat and exploration - that would see an "enigmatic child of Fate returning at long last to Earth".
</p>
<p>
At the time, the project was expected to arrive in 2024, but Extremely OK <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/celeste-developers-next-game-wont-be-out-this-year">confirmed a delay last March</a>. And while it didn't commit to a new release window, it moved to assure fans progress was not "stagnant" and that the team was "still excited to work on it".

<p>
Today, however, the studio has announced Earthblade is no more. In a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/">lengthy post shared on the Extremely OK website</a>, studio director Maddy Thorson went into some of the factors leading to the project's cancellation. These include a "disagreement about the IP rights of Celeste" which, as painted in today's announcement, saw Thorson and Noel Berry on one side and studio "founding member" Pedro Medeiros on the other.
</p><p>
Thorson says the issue was eventually resolved following a "very difficult and heartbreaking process", but noted the outcome resulted in Medeiros' departure from the Earthblade project after "both parties... agreed in the end that we should go our separate way".
</p>
<p>
This, in turn, prompted the remaining members of Extremely OK to "take a serious look at whether fighting through to finish Earthblade was the right path forward". And while the project "had a lot going for it", according to Thorson, "it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process."
</p>
<p>
"Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day," Thorson continued, "and realised that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting."
</p>
<p>
"Pedro isn't to blame for this," Thorson stressed. "In fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."
</p><p>
With Earthblade officially no more, other members of the team have also "moved on". However, Thorson and Berry now plan to "take all of the (many!) lessons we've learned... wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects." As a result, the duo are "prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at Celeste's or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/towerfall">TowerFall</a>'s inception."
</p>
<p>
"We are happy to return to our roots," Thorson concluded, "and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us."

One of the main reasons for the cancelation revolved around disagreements over the Celeste IP rights, the details of which the studio has decided not to disclose.

Late last month, Noel and I made the difficult decision to cancel <em>Earthblade</em>. Yes, we are opening the year with a huge, heartbreaking, and yet relieving failure. I want to outline in this post what lead to this decision, and what it means for the future of [Extremely OK Games].</p><p>Before I get into it however, I want to acknowledge that this news will likely come as a shock to fans who have been eagerly anticipating the game. We made this decision in December and felt it best to wait until now to announce it. For us on the inside we’ve had some time to process, grieve, and work toward accepting this, although that process is nonlinear and still ongoing. For those only reading this now who might be emotionally invested in this project, we’re sorry to disappoint you.</p><p><strong>What Happened</strong></p><p>Earlier this year, a fracture began forming in the team. Specifically, this was between us (Noel &amp; I) and Pedro, a founding member of [Extremely OK Games], longtime friend &amp; collaborator, and art director of <em>Earthblade</em> and pixel / user interface artist on <em>Celeste</em> and <em>TowerFall</em>. The conflict centered around a disagreement about the IP rights of <em>Celeste</em>, which we won’t be detailing publicly—this was obviously a very difficult and heartbreaking process. We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways. Pedro is now working on his game Neverway, which you should check out—we’ve played it and it’s very promising.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The project had a lot going for it but, frustratingly, it was also not as far along as one would expect after such a protracted development process. I do believe that if we soldiered on despite it all, that Earthblade could still be a great game.</p><p>But would it be worth the pain? Noel and I also began to reflect on how the game has felt for us to work on day-to-day, and realized that it has been a struggle for a long time. Sure, working on one project for so long is bound to become a slog, but this feels like a deeper problem. <em>Celeste</em>‘s success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting. Pedro isn’t to blame for this—in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief.</p><p>Because this is the internet, I want to be unequivocal here that the decision and responsibility for cancelling <em>Earthblade</em> rests entirely with me and Noel. If you were excited about <em>Earthblade</em> and angry about its cancelling, Pedro and the Neverway team aren’t the enemy and anyone who treats them as such isn’t welcome in any [Extremely OK Games] community.</p><p><strong>What Next</strong></p><p>While this has shaken out other members of the team have moved on as well. Noel &amp; I now want to take all of the (many!) lessons we’ve learned from <em>Earthblade</em>, wipe the slate clean, and refocus ourselves back to smaller-scale projects. We’re prototyping again and exploring at our own pace, and trying to rediscover game development in a manner closer to how we approached it at <em>Celeste</em>‘s or TowerFall’s inception. We still, of course, hope to collaborate with Amora, Kyle, Chevy, Lena, and Power-Up Audio again in the future. Scaling the core team up post-<em>Celeste</em> has ultimately been a failure, and that’s okay. We gave it all we’ve got, and life goes on. We are happy to return to our roots and reclaim some joy in our creative process, and see where that takes us.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Razer steps into the handheld gaming space with a simple but well-designed dock that will be useful for a variety of devices.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">As the line between handheld and home consoles blurs there's been more of a need--and want--for docks that can bridge the gap between small and big screen gaming. For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices. Everything from beefy hardware like the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-extreme-gets-200-discount-comes-with-free-travel-case/1100-6524126/" data-ref-id="1100-6524126">Asus ROG Ally</a> to comparatively modestly powered emulation handhelds like Anbernic's various devices are capable of being plugged into a large screen for a more traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Docks, then, are almost essential these days. Beyond functionality, I look for the aesthetic advantage a dock can provide. I like my devices nicely placed and positioned as something that looks good in a room, instead of just hanging out near a power outlet while on charge. With that in mind, my docks of choice have always come from JSAUX, which offers the ability to turn the Steam Deck, Ally, and any other PC-handheld into something that can actually function as a computer. Along with a HDMI out and few USB ports to connect peripherals to, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Charging-Deck-HB0603/dp/B0B7HVZNMB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSAUX docks</a> include an ethernet port, making both working and gaming with good internet stability much more viable.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Handheld Dock Chroma</a> isn't very different from these, despite being more expensive at $80. However, it does address a couple of key issues I always have with docks. The first of these is docks aren't typically very nice to look at and the second being the stability can often be an issue. Razer sent over a dock for testing; I've been using it for about a week and, as a whole, I'm impressed with it as an overall package. It doesn't do anything unique, but it does offer everything you would want and need from a hardware and connectivity standpoint while also being designed in a thoughtful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Steam Deck</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432291,1300-4432292,1300-4432293,1300-4432294,1300-4432295,1300-4432296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First and foremost, those looking to use the Handheld Dock Chroma as more than just a charging device with HDMI out capabilities will be able to make the most of the three USB 3.2 and/or the USB Type C ports to plug in keyboard, mice, controllers or anything else that's required to make a PC-handheld function as a desktop computer. There's a HDMI port that supports 4K at 60hz for external screens, and a gigabit ethernet port. There's also 100w passthrough for power. Again, it's mostly standard features and available in both JSAUX's docks and Valve's official dock for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">However, where Razer's dock stands out is the mechanism used to hold devices in place. It's a back plate that covers the rear of most devices and provides good support and prevents any wobbling or tipping. This might sound like a simple thing that isn't really a big deal but, for me, I've always disliked the way the JSAUX and Valve docks I've used don't have a back and rely on how the base is shaped to keep devices in place. These all function perfectly fine for most people who don't really think about it, but I always felt my devices were somewhat precariously placed.</p><p dir="ltr">The back plate design Razer has used gives me much more confidence and, better still, it's adjustable so the angle at which your device is placed can be changed. The backplate can be raised and angled to fit into rubber grooves in the base to lend further stability, but also better accommodate a range of devices. Like other stands, the USB connector that plugs into your device has a goose neck design, so you're limited by how far it can extend, but most gaming devices, phones, and tablets should be able to settle in without issue. I have taken to positioning the back plate at its steepest angle and then placing my ROG Ally X on it for a viewing angle that is much more comfortable on a desk. Adjusting the placement also means that there's a variety of viewing angles available, which is handy if you want people to crowd around a single device for multiplayer (I ain't doing that).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289" data-ratio="0.41683501683502" data-width="1485" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Asus ROG Ally</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not in use, the back plate can be flattened horizontally to serve as a top surface, giving the dock a box-like form factor that makes it much easier to transport. While most docks are lightweight enough to throw in a bag and take with you, the flat, rectangular design makes it much easier to place in sleeves and pockets in bags without worrying if it's scratching something else or being crushed by other things. It also makes it easier to take out and put in. The aluminium chassis makes it feel lightweight and sturdy, and matte black texturing means it can easily blend into most setups. Of course, there's also a button that you can hit to activate and cycle through RGB lighting options on the bottom of the base. It's worth noting that the package only includes the dock--so it's up to you to provide the power source.</p><p dir="ltr">All that means that the Razer Handheld Dock is a dock that I feel good about having, instead of something that just does the job. It's a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it's easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it's on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Disclosure: Razer provided the Handheld Chroma Dock to GameSpot for testing.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/youtube%E2%80%99s-new-ai-is-inspiring-content-creators-to-make-their-videos-boring.1089381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/youtube-inspiration-tab-ai-slop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, YouTube introduced a new generative AI-powered “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inspiration</a>” tab for creators. Like so many other gen AI products foisted on us by our increasingly shameless tech overlords, it has proven to be a solution looking for a problem. To creators producing <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitsarkar.bsky.social/post/3lgcdhviffs2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">award-winning journalistic work</a>, for example, it has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doomquasar.bsky.social/post/3lgdxgvtodc2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> absolute bangers like “Ranking the most iconic video game villains” and “Top 5 hidden video game secrets revealed.”</p><p>Before we get into more suggestions YouTubers have shared with Aftermath, I want to point out what I feel is the funniest part of this whole thing: Each YouTube-generated video idea is also rated in terms of potential audience interest. The above two suggestions, given to Polygon’s Simone de Rochefort, are considered “very low interest” and “low interest,” respectively. <em>Most </em>suggestions I’ve come across so far, in fact, have been dubbed total snoozers by the system itself. Why would anybody use this?</p><p>Perhaps YouTube is trying to motivate people to spend time with the Inspiration tab’s “Let’s brainstorm” module, which allows you to suggest a topic to get YouTube’s creativity-corroding juices flowing. You can then click on a video to see an outline, titles, and a spread of AI slop thumbnails. In its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDbJGw_Xzos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> introducing the feature, YouTube noted that you can further refine these suggestions with prompts of your own, like “incorporate humor.” Whose humor? At what pace? To what specific end? Who cares. The robot will add a packet of Humor Powder to your gruel, and you’ll like it.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s grim stuff, especially considering <a href="https://x.com/bcmerchant/status/1882151046606475356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies like Netflix</a>’s documented interest in bulldozing through concerns like licensing and taste to churn out endless – and endlessly bland – buckets of AI mush. YouTube evidently wants actual creators to function as cogs in that machine, which will eventually replace them if the unimaginative soul voids currently running our world have their way.&nbsp;</p><p>But on the upside, this stuff sucks! A lot! That has been and will remain a massive impediment to generative AI’s widespread adoption, which fills me with hope that the AI bubble is on a one-way collision course with a very big needle. That in mind, let’s have a laugh at its expense.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the Inspiration tab of YouTube video essayist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JacobGeller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Geller</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Once again, we’re working with bottom-of-the-barrel ideas like “Games that don’t age well” and “Video games that deserve a sequel,” but I want to give special recognition to “How video games teach us about life,” which is accompanied by this incredible thumbnail:</p><figure><figcaption>Jacob Geller</figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, I’d be more likely to click on a video titled "How viideo qvormes teach us aboul tde" than the original suggestion, so maybe YouTube is onto something here.</p><p>“Fdrogttten NENS GEMS," which YouTube’s AI thought would be up Retronauts co-host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrIttXi0WgLXHI1poCk0D6g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeremy Parish</a>’s alley, is similarly exceptional:</p><figure><figcaption>Jeremy Parish</figcaption></figure><p>I, too, love the Nintendo Entertainment Nintendo System.</p><p>You will not be surprised to learn that an overarching theme of YouTube’s video ideas is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hmsnofun.bsky.social/post/3lgdzdbvda22o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rehashing what creators have already posted before</a>, down to the title. Except, as per usual, generative AI can’t actually understand anything, so it seems to be playing mix and match with titles and ideas. Take, for example, these masterpieces offered to GameSpot associate editor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thecrawl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Hesse</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>Brendan Hesse</figcaption></figure><p>"I already made basically all these videos, including 'Lunacid vs The Crawl,'” Hesse told Aftermath, "but it wasn't a versus; it was just an interview."</p><p>Indie-focused YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/wanderbots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wander</a> received a selection of ideas that seemed to be based on recent high-performing videos, but again, with little rhyme or reason. This resulted in entirely made-up games like <em>Digseum Artifactor Excavator</em> and <em>Eldritch Museum Entity</em>:</p><figure><figcaption>Wander</figcaption></figure><p>George "Chairman George" Weidman of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bunnyhopshow/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bunnyhop</a> believes the AI is skimming titles and basically nothing else of substance.</p><p>"I especially like how after making a video essay titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of <em>Pentiment</em>,' it suggests I make a video titled 'The Boisterous Bibliography of Other Games,'" Weidman told Aftermath. "It doesn't seem to be scraping the YouTuber's script transcriptions or bio pages for topics we might be interested in, just flashy titles and thumbnails. These suggestions are just spitting back out what are the already-existing SEO optimization trends, and it's funny how one of those trends seems to be an aspirationally highbrow appeal that so many Gamer video essays strive for."</p><p>Suggested video outlines are also a trip. YouTube asked games writer and hobbyist YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/cbake76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Baker</a> to take a walk down memory lane and hark back to all the “iconic” voice acting of <em>Spider-Man</em> games from the days before games really had voice acting:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Baker’s AI-generated thumbnails – one of which seems to depict Spider-Man using his hand like a phone or perhaps Spider-Man yanking his own head off – are also really something:</p><figure><figcaption>Chris Baker</figcaption></figure><p>Are you feeling inspired? I sure am.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the latest RTX 5090 Founders Edition card that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24347693/nvidia-rtx-5090-vs-rtx-4090-design-fans-hardware">we are currently testing</a> achieves its goals through a modular four-part design with a separate I/O board that allows air to flow through for a more efficient and compact cooler. According to Nvidia, these changes are why the new 5090 fits in two slots on the motherboard compared to the previous three-slot 4090. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Originally set to come out as early as 2023, development didn’t progress as quickly as the team had expected. A planned 2024 launch was eventually delayed as well. </p><p>In the cancellation announcement today, Thorson writes of a falling-out with pixel artist Pedro Medeiros, whose visual style defined the aesthetic of the upcoming project, over a dispute related to IP rights for<em> Celeste</em>, the beloved 2018 GOTY contender. “We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways,” <em>Earthblade</em>’s director wrote. “Pedro is now working on his game <em>Neverway</em>, which you should check out - we’ve played it and it’s very promising.”</p><p>Thorson went on to pull the curtain back some on the latest project’s difficult development. “<em>Celeste</em>’s success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting,” Thorson wrote. “Pedro isn’t to blame for this-in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief.”</p><p>For now, Thorson and <em>Celeste </em>co-creator Noel Berry have gone back to prototyping new potential projects while the rest of the team has moved on. The dream of <em>Earthblade</em> might be dead, but the minds behind it aren’t done making games. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has announced today that it is revising its outlook for the fiscal year after a slowdown in Global Football net bookings growth, and Dragon Age: The Veilguard missed the company's internal targets by nearly 50%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a press release,</a> the company said it was reducing its expectations for the fiscal year ending March of 2025 from mid-single-digit growth to mid-single-digit decline. The largest culprit, EA says, was global football, aka EA Sports FC, which it says experienced a slowdown last year in Q3 after two consecutive fiscal years of double-digit net bookings growth. In the press release, EA CEO Andrew Wilson specifically pointed to EA Sports FC 25 as underperforming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in addition to global football, EA also mentioned that Dragon Age "engaged" 1.5 million players during the quarter, which was down nearly 50% from the company's projections. Notably, EA does not say the 1.5 million number was unit sales - Dragon Age: The Veilguard was also available as a part of EA's Play Pro subscription service. Additionally, it's not clear whether EA is counting a free trial of the game that was available through the cheaper EA Play subscription in the 1.5 million number either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard released on October 31, 2024, and EA's report only covers the final quarter of the year through the end of December, meaning these engagement totals encompass the game's first two months on the market. It's worth noting that 1.5 million (or thereabouts) isn't an awful sales number, and companies overestimating sales targets is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-looks-to-assassins-creed-for-future-salvation-amid-challenging-year">nothing new</a>. In its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">first three days on the market</a>, The Veilguard managed to debut at No.6 on Circana's charts for the top-selling games in the US, and that's not including Steam digital sales. However, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-faces-uphill-battle-to-match-inquisitions-launch-sales-says-analyst">analyst we spoke to in November</a> suggested that Veilguard had a tough road ahead:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just looking at the first days of sales and initial engagement levels via Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, it's been a good - but not great - launch," said Mat Piscatella at Circana. "Dragon Age: The Veilguard did not reach the launch week sales levels of either Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth or Dragon's Dogma II, and it will be a bit of an uphill battle to reach Inquisition's lifetime sales."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been some smoke around Dragon Age: The Veilguard's struggles, such as it receiving a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-cyber-monday-deal-2024">significant discount just a month after launch</a> for Cyber Monday, and the departure of its director, Corinne Busche, from BioWare just last week. We've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">chronicled some of the game's development challenges already</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">layoffs</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-4-creative-director-left-bioware">departure</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-to-leave-studio-all-current-projects-planned-to-continue">several project leads</a> at different stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">thought Dragon Age: The Veilguard was amazing</a>, saying it "refreshes and reinvigorates this storied series with enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of companions, and moving character writing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-talk-weapon-changes-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Players prepare themselves each time a new Monster Hunter is released, wondering how their favorite weapon will feel in their hands in the upcoming game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the 14 weapon types displays its own unique characteristics while still changing to fit the design of each new title. Monster Hunter: World did away with segmenting off each area during a quest, while Monster Hunter Rise is notable for its Wirebug action. The weapons that feel at home in the hunters' hands show a new side of themselves in line with a game's design. So, what kinds of concepts guided the tuning of each weapon in Monster Hunter Wilds, a game that aims to create a seamless hunting experience?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To hear about these weapon details that act as determining gameplay factors, we spoke with the Monster Hunter Wilds art director and executive director, Kaname Fujioka, and Wilds director, Yuya Tokuda. Fujioka was also the director of the first Monster Hunter game, while Tokuda has had a hand in the series since Monster Hunter Freedom. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">IGN First Monster Hunter Wilds Oilwell Basin Artwork</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the interview, we heard about the concept and development process for various weapons, garnering new details on weapons that players have been particularly interested in, as well as the kinds of adjustments made for the release version of the game after the feedback they received from the November 2024 Open Beta Test.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Adjustments for a Seamless World</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda starts by saying that significant changes needed to be made to how a number of weapons are used due to major shifts in the gameplay loop, affected by Wilds’ seamless map and changing weather conditions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are a number of large changes to the Light and Heavy Bowgun, as well as the Bow," he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While previous Monster Hunter titles featured a routine of returning to your base to replenish your resources after each quest, Wilds aims to offer seamless play, making this process no longer required. Ranged weapons in Monster Hunter historically use consumable ammo and coatings, so there was a possibility that they would be more of a burden to use in Wilds without an established time to restock these items. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"That's why we designed it so that basic damage sources can be used without expending resources,” says Tokuda. “We balanced it around the idea that things like normal, pierce and spread ammo for Bowguns and coatings for Bows can fire unlimited times while managing your gauge. But we still wanted it to be possible to use what you’ve prepared ahead of time or what you find in the field on top of that, and so our balancing took into account the presence of design that allows you to create powerful ammo with attributes from gathered materials."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One change after the next was made to each of the weapons while considering the new elements found in Wilds and the game's concept, with ranged weapon changes being the most notable. Fujioka says that this goes beyond playstyle and mechanics, even stretching into design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had the idea of wanting to properly show the movement of charging a Bowgun for a special shot,” he says. “Shots that cancel out a monster's attack look properly convincing as they perform that canceling. Ever since the previous game in the series, we've put a lot of work into making it visually clear to the player what they're doing in the moment."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">He says that advances in technology increasing the ability to create such depictions also play a major role in these animation changes. Players can swing weapons, put them away, and switch between them. Tokuda says that adding more fine detail to the transitionary animations that connect each action changed even what hunters can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One common concept shared by all weapons is that we made sure it's possible for hunters to use them in a natural way given the situation at the moment,” he says. “Our goal was to do this particularly when you can't make any inputs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in previous games, you needed to stow your weapon and stop moving before using a healing item. The greater ability to depict actions through animations played a role in changing that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka continues: "The Focus Mode that we added to [Wilds] is something we put a lot of work into when it comes to action. You can move while facing a specified direction, making continuous attacks possible while on the move but slightly off-center from your target. Players can properly go in the direction they want. We wanted to make a game that made possible the image players have in their minds about how they want to play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There have been incredible technical leaps for the development environment in recent years, such as in managing animations, and there have been even greater changes in how games themselves are played. For action games, in particular, the question of how you meet the players’ desires to play in a certain way in the moment they actively want to make a movement is an important one. During development, we're always conscious about not being left behind by changes in the times."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Focus Strikes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One major change in Wilds is the new system that allows you to wound a monster if you continuously attack a specific spot on its body. Whether or not a wound is formed is generally determined by the amount of damage dealt to that area. Some acts wound a monster more easily, such as attacks that use environmental elements like falling rocks or battles between monsters. When it comes to attacks from player weapons, though, they generally form due to accumulated damage, which is why there aren't any differences between weapon types in this regard.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunters can deal massive damage to wounded monsters by using Focus Strikes while in Focus Mode. Completely different animations were prepared for each weapon type, such as acrobatically flying all around a monster with the dual blades, making it appear at first glance like there are differences in abilities here. So do different weapons have different Focus Strike effects aside from the visuals? Tokuda gives us an answer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For Focus Strikes, we wanted to have animations that show each weapon's uniqueness,” he says. “But I admit that this also created a variation between weapons during the open beta test where some were far too strong, while feeling the strengths of others was difficult. Though we do allow differences between weapons in order to give them personality, we don't want the disparity between weapons to be too extreme, and so we're tuning them to be more standardized for the official release of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The wound system gives hunters a new option when hunting. For example, if you're attacking the head while using a hammer to flinch a monster, the accumulated damage can create a wound there. You're then able to deal a large amount of damage by then hitting it with a Focus Strike, but that wound will turn into a scar, meaning that you can no longer create a new head wound. You can of course continue to focus on the head, or you can target another body part that can be wounded. Once players are in the latter half of the game, they will learn that there are ways to use the environment that lead to unexpected scars. Tokuda says that, like flinching and part breaking, the wound system acts as a new option for players, where they may expect to create a wound on a monster by hitting it just one more time in a certain location.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Monsters are unwounded when a quest begins, but you can hunt monsters as you explore the locale in Wilds, so as the situation in the locale changes, monsters can have turf wars even without a hunter's involvement,” he says. “This means that a monster may already have multiple wounds by the time it interacts with the player. You can think yourself lucky and hunt a monster when it's in that state. There may also be special additional rewards for felling monsters wandering the locale. In some cases, there are even monsters that give gems as additional rewards."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this game, the use of Focus Mode and wounds has made it easier than before to land dramatically damaging attacks, like the Great Sword's Charged Slash. So were changes made to monster health and toughness to go along with the addition of these features?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not as if that was our intention from the start, but health did end up being a little bit higher than World once we thought about maintaining appropriate playtimes and player satisfaction, compared to past titles,” says Tokuda. “Elements like flinch resistance are also higher, but this doesn't mean that hunts will be tedious. Part of the purpose of Focus Mode is to allow players to feel more accomplished through shorter loops. We tried to design it so that the time they spend hunting is even more concentrated than before."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Tempo of the Great Sword</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can imagine that tuning each of the 14 weapon types requires quite a lot of development work. We asked Tokuda if each weapon type had a dedicated director or designer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are some staff members who oversee multiple weapon types, which ultimately makes for about six individual planners, who are responsible for player experience,” he replies. “We don't just have game designers, of course. We include artists and animation designers to discuss details like what kinds of movements would be good and how that may mean a weapon could be better off used in a different way as we polish the weapons. We didn't have staff members assigned to weapons from the start; their number grows as development progresses. We generally begin by developing the Great Sword as a prototype, then verify weapons like the Sword and Shield and Heavy Bowgun, applying the knowledge we get from there to the other weapons as we create them."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Designers and artists work together to create a weapon's action as they think about how much fun it is to use along with how good it feels to look at. It seems that Focus Strikes were an inspiring idea for the art team led by Fujioka as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Attacks like the Focus Strike didn't exist in the series before, so now that we had this new form of expression available to us, we began by coming up with ideas while focusing on making it feel good over anything performance related,” Fujioka explains. “The Great Sword is an all-rounder weapon, so we generally begin with it when creating animations. It's one of the first weapons we created for the original Monster Hunter, and there's a strong sense of wanting to challenge ourselves with the Great Sword first. We felt excited when we first made the Focus Strike for the Great Sword, thinking that if we were able to create something that feels this good, we'd be able to do even more with the other weapons."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that the Great Sword has an even larger presence when it comes to the development of Monster Hunter's animations than we expected. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda continues: "I feel like weapons with a sense of heavy tempo like the Great Sword are rare in other action games. That's why it's a Monster Hunter standard to begin by making sure that the Great Sword is fun to use. The concepts for the other weapons come together in part by placing the Great Sword at the center and seeing how we can differentiate each of the other weapons from it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I guess you could say that once you're used to the game, you'll have noticed that the Great Sword is the most rounded of them all. While the speed of weapons like the Dual Blades or the Sword and Shield will always result in there being technical elements needed in order to earn damage in small ways, you're able to go straight to defeating a monster once you're good at using the Great Sword's style as it exists. It can even block, it has area of effect attacks, and it can create moments where you can deal solid damage. It's actually made so that you can go back and forth with a monster in the most straightforward way if you can just get used to its weight."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Creating a game that's fun to play using the Great Sword's weight makes it easier to create weapons that fight with a quicker tempo,” adds Fujioka. “If high-tempo weapons become the focus, or if we match the speed of the monsters to them, movements will just get quicker and quicker. I think that we're able to create a game that feels like Monster Hunter when you play it by making sure that both sides are properly tuned with a weapon that has the Great Sword's tempo."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Weapons with Personality</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Every hunter has a favorite weapon, with strong feelings about weapon types in general. But at the same time, it's an unavoidable fact that there will always be a most used and most popular weapon along with a 14th-place weapon. Players will make themselves heard if they feel that a weapon is being treated unfairly, and many players will inevitably pick a weapon up if its strengths are easy to understand. There are no right answers when it comes to weapon tuning, which is why these creators aim to bring out their individuality instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka explains, "We always think that it's better to focus on how to design what makes a weapon unique rather than trying to make all weapons equally easy to use. That said, we do think it's a problem if players can't have the gaming experience we want them to have. Of course, it's not a good thing to have a weapon that's both easy to use and overpowered, so there are weapons we've made a lot of changes to for the release version of the game given what we saw in the open beta."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What exactly does he mean by "what makes a weapon unique?” Tokuda explains, using the example of the Hunting Horn. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the outset, I told the team that I wanted the concept of this weapon to be that it can produce proper amounts of damage when used where it performs best, the area around you,” he says. “Instead of being able to unleash one attack after the next, you can use something like an Echo Bubble to deal damage by controlling the area. Since we have this element of sound that other weapons can't produce, how do we make use of that while outputting damage? That's the kind of thing we challenged ourselves to do with the weapon. Instead of thinking that it's all about damage, we care more about making the most out of each weapon's personality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now that you're able to carry two weapons in this game, there was some discussion during the open beta about the most powerful choice being to buff yourself with the Hunting Horn before switching to another weapon and fighting. We're tuning the release version, balancing with the end content in mind, to make sure that the Hunting Horn isn't the only choice for a secondary weapon by having self-buffs be worthwhile but not too strong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are always going to be certain weapons that do better or worse against each individual monster. The developers accept that these discrepancies are going to exist, but they want to avoid there being a certain build for a certain weapon that would allow anyone to hunt every monster in the most efficient way possible. Of course, the range of monsters that players target will narrow the further into the endgame they go, and weapon usage will narrow to some degree from an efficiency standpoint. Yet flattening the uniqueness of the game's weapons and monsters would be to erase the roots of Monster Hunter. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka has this to say. "While I think that weapons that stand at the top in terms of time efficiency–ease of use and ease of hunting–are going to see more popularity, we have made it so that if you really care about a weapon type, you'll be able to beat a monster through enough trial and error." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regarding this, Tokuda brings up the fact that hunters can carry a primary and a secondary weapon in Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even if you have somewhat specialized weapons, it'd make me happy if players brought two in order for them to complement one another as they play," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Build Your Own Skills</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When thinking about weapon performance, one ultimately begins to wonder about the endgame content that is decorations. The decoration system affects skill builds, so what does it look like in this new title? Tokuda explains.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Decorations are currently similar to the system in World, with decorations having specific skill abilities,” he says. “These skills are still activated by placing them into weapon or armor slots (In Wilds, weapon and armor skills can each be activated separately). However, you can make single-skill decorations through something like alchemy. So in [Wilds], players won't have the issue of never being able to get a specific skill."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka nods vigorously from his seat beside Tokuda before speaking about his experience with World. "I never ended up getting it once. My Shield Jewel 2... I ended up finishing the game without having completed my build." (Read more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-monster-hunter-wilds-surprising-skill-and-weapon-changes-preview">how equipment skills work in Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that we are on the subject of builds, I decide to ask the duo about their favorite weapons. Tokuda says he often uses long-range weapons like the Heavy Bowgun and Light Bowgun, and the Sword and Shield which has high adaptability to show monster actions and movements, because as the game's director, he needs to explain what's going on as he plays. He says that he'd like to take plenty of time after the release of Wilds to try out all the weapons now that hunters can carry two. Meanwhile, fans are aware that Fujioka's favorite weapon is the Lance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm a Lance main, or rather, I only use the Lance,” he admits. “I think that the Lance is a weapon where positioning is very important, as you stick to a monster's feet or some other part. Until now, you had to perform this kind of positioning by walking or sidestepping, but in Wilds it's now a lot easier to make minor adjustments, like shifting over slightly as you attack. It's a simple change, but it's important for players to have more choices, so in that sense I think that's one of the positives for Lance users in this game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then again, the Lance is also the weapon that generated the largest reaction during the open beta. While the developers have already announced that major tweaks will be coming to a number of weapons before the official release, we ask Tokuda about the user reaction they received during the beta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We received a lot of feedback during the open beta test, and to be honest, one of the largest reactions we got was that the Lance isn't embodying its concept as a weapon,” he says. “Our intention was for players to guard in a variety of ways, sticking to a monster as required and counterattacking. But there were a lot of actions that weren't working properly, such as it being hard to use and perform the right action at the right time, actions going off by mistake, actions coming out late, and so on. Surrounded by so many other actions that worked properly, it ended up feeling like a pretty dull weapon. We're now making major improvements to this for the release version, and we hope you look forward to that."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at the time of our interview, the Wilds creators were working tirelessly in order to give hunters the best time they can. They've heard what players had to tell them during the open beta. Both as developers who've made Monster Hunter for many years now and as hunters, they're coming face to face with the 14 weapon types to build the greatest gaming experience. Monster Hunter continues to be an unmatched action game series because of the support it receives from both the players' passion and the developers’ tireless spirit of inquiry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see for yourself just how much the Monster Hunter Wilds developers take feedback from passionate players into account in their official detailed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update video</a>, where Tokuda covers performance enhancements, detailed weapon changes, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shuka Yamada is a freelance writer for IGN Japan.

            <p>
EA has lowered its financial forecast for its current fiscal year, pointing to the 'underperformance' of EA Sports FC 2025 - which it says accounts for the "majority" of the shortfall - alongside lower-than-expected interest in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.
</p>
<p>
As noted in EA's <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx">revised outlook</a> for the year ending 31st March 2025, the company was previously forecasting a  "mid-single-digit growth in live services net bookings". However, it now expects a "mid-single-digit decline", blaming the "majority of the change" on EA Sports 2025 - which saw a "slowdown in momentum" following its release in September.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA has reported lower-than-expected interest in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, saying BioWare's fantasy RPG "engaged" approximately 1.5m players during the quarter - a number it describes as being "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations."

<p>
All this means the publisher now anticipates net bookings of approximately $2.21 billion for its third fiscal quarter and an updated range of $7-7.15 billion for fiscal year 2025.
</p>
<p>
"During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio, EA CEO Andrew Wilson wrote in a statement accompanying today's revised guidance. "However, Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> underperformed our net bookings expectations." Even so, Wilson says, "We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline."
</p><p>
Despite Dragon Age: The Veilguard failing to meet EA's business expectations, BioWare's latest was well-received by critics when it launched in October 2024. "It's warm and welcoming, funny and hopeful, gentle when it needs to be, and of course it's epic," Eurogamer's Robert Purchese <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">wrote in his five star review</a>. "The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell was less enthused by EA Sports FC 2025, however. "Another year where the annual tweaks settle in such a way as to recreate, or reposition, the same old problems that have been here since the beginning," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">wrote in his three star review</a>. "This is EA Sports FC 25. I love it. I hate it. It'll probably be like this forever."

<p>EA has announced that Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet the company’s internal expectations. In its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Pre-Announces-Preliminary-Q3-FY25-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preliminary Q3 FY2025 earnings report</a>, EA revealed that it was forced to lower its revenue forecast for both the quarter and fiscal year after the first Dragon Age game in 10 years missed expectations by a wide margin. </p>



<p>“Dragon Age engaged approximately 1.5 million players during the quarter, down nearly 50% from the company’s expectations,” the company said. </p>



<p>Because of the lower player engagement of Dragon Age: The Veilguard—as well as EA Sports FC 25—EA adjusted its expected net bookings for the year to be between $7-$7.15 billion compared to the originally expected $7.5-$7.8 billion. For the quarter itself, EA has adjusted its expectations to $2.21 billion in net bookings.</p>







<p><strong>“</strong>During Q3, we continued to deliver high-quality games and experiences across our portfolio; however, Dragon Age and EA SPORTS FC 25 underperformed our net bookings expectations,” said EA CEO Andrew Wilson in a prepared statement. “We remain confident in our long-term strategy and expect a return to growth in FY26, as we execute against our pipeline.”</p>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was released on October 31, 2024 to generally favorable reviews from critics. The game’s director, Corine Busche, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-vielguards-game-director-has-reportedly-left-bioware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently left BioWare</a> after 18 years with the company for a new opportunity.</p>



<p>EA will present its full earnings on February 4 at 5pm ET/2pm PT. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the call when it takes place. </p>

                <p>Several popular gaming-related subreddits are banning posts that link to social media site X (formerly Twitter).

Since the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/2025/01/22/x-ban-spreads-across-reddit-as-communities-react-to-musks-gesture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">influx of blacklisting</a> began, there have been a number of posts made across various subreddits raising the question of if the respective subreddit should follow suit.

The extent of the bans vary from subreddit to subreddit, with r/Nintendo and r/SteamDeck allowing screenshots while r/WOW is prohibiting images as well.</p><p>The official reasons for the ban vary, though many cite Elon Musk's recent actions as the primary motivation. Musk, who owns X, recently attended President Trump's inauguration and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was seen doing a Nazi-like salute</a>. However, different forums have also cited X's lack of moderation and "increasingly hateful" content as reason to blacklist the website.</p><p>"This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now," r/PCGaming moderator Shock4ndAwe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship-pandemic-middle-earth-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> board game is coming to store shelves. Z-Man Games, the studio known for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-legacy-season-0-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is using their beloved game system as a foundation for <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>, a take on Tolkien's iconic world.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, Z-Man Games provides an overview of <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>. It is, as expected, an adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy where players must work together to destroy The One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.</p>

Each player starts controlling two characters in their canon locations. Frodo starts in The Shire, Arwen starts in Rivendell, etc..From there, players can move characters to different places and join friendly characters and troops to form their fellowship.</p>

<p>Once the players finish their turn, shadow troops will deploy from Mordor and spread out, attempting to capture safe-havens. In addition, Sauron commands the Nazgul to stop Frodo from reaching Mount Doom. For the players to succeed, they will need to use stealth, resistance, friendship, and valor to overcome these dangerous challenges.</p>

<p>Like other <em>Pandemic</em> games, <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is replayable. The game includes 24 objective cards, each one based on iconic moments from the books, Each time you play, you can choose a different subset of cards, leading to other scenarios. Of course, there is the straightforward, but challenging scenario fans are familiar with.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Z-Man Games has adapted a beloved fantasy property with their <em>Pandemic</em> system. The studio also adapted the iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wrath-of-lich-king-board-game-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em></a> to gaming tables back in 2021. It even dipped into space fantasy with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-clone-wars-pandemic-game-coming-to-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></a> adaptation in 2022.</p>

<p><em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is available for pre-order right now. There is no official release date, but early adopters will receive a promotional Gandalf The White meeple and character card at no additional cost.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is getting five new maps in Season 2. The first details for those maps were confirmed via the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-2-trailer-gives-more-details-on-maps-modes-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 launch trailer</a>, but, now, Activision has released full details on the new multiplayer maps coming to the game. </p>



<p>The five new maps are Bounty, Lifeline, Dealership, Grind, and Bullet. Three maps—Bounty, Lifeline, and Dealership—will be available at launch on January 28 while the other two will come mid-season. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-zombies-season-two-maps-modes-announcement#Maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Details of each map</a> can be found below via Activision.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-2-multiplayer-maps">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 Multiplayer Maps</h2>



<p><strong>Bounty</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Bounty is a new 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a penthouse at the top of an Avalon skyscraper. </p>



<p>“From the starting point of a pristine Patio, move inside an opulent, gold-plated Nightclub and Lounge where top-shelf entertaining was provided to a variety of rich guests,” the map’s description reads. “Ambush enemies by jumping over the light fixtures hanging over the Lobby below.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Lifeline</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It may seem similar to Black Ops 2’s Hijacked map, but Lifeline appears to be much smaller an more chaotic. A new small-sized map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6, Lifeline sees you fight on a high-end yacht that’s burning in the middle of the sea.</p>



<p>“From Bow to Aft, it won’t take long to collide in the center Bar and gambling den, the disco room, or along the steps on Portside and Starboard,” says Activision. “Keep your head on a swivel or risk getting thrown overboard.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Dealership</strong> <strong>(at launch)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The last of the three Season 2 launch maps, Dealership is another medium-sized 6v6 map that takes place around the Pallasar car dealership. And while it looks like a dealership on the outside, it’s actually a front for a black market where cars are traded for weapons.</p>



<p>“Battle around the wreckage in the Car Lot and Showroom, pushing the fight into the interior Commissary and Lounge or out on the Courtyard and once offered an idyllic vista,” it’s description reads. “Open the sliding doors to either side of the Garage for a quick ambush or close them to stall incoming enemies.”</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Grind</strong> <strong>(mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A remaster of the classic map from Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Grind is a 6v6 medium-sized map that takes place in a skatepark. In addition to the outdoor skatepark, there is a pro shop and indoor stadium to fight your opponents in.</p>



<p>“Use the ramps for cover and to get above the competition and bust out your best tricks like the 360-corkscrew one-shot. Also expect an additional surprise related to this map, later in the season,” Activision said.</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>Bullet (mid-season)</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, Bullet is another small map for Strike 2v2 and 6v6 multiplayer matches. The map takes players aboard a bullet train where you can go between train cars with little room to hide. If inside gets too tight, players can head to the roof of the train to fight.</p>



<p>“Race through the automatic sliding doors separating each car, from the first-class lounge through the dining car, second-class seats, and up to the cab where the fallen conductor dispels any hope of reaching the destination in one piece,” Activision writes.</p>

It comes with news about all the maps, modes, guns, and changes set to arrive when Season 2 starts next week.

The Titanium Core skin is ripped straight out of the movie, featuring the machine’s iconic, cold facial features and glowing red eyes. The T-800 skin, meanwhile, aims to bring Schwarzenegger's appearance to the battlefield, though it doesn’t exactly look like the younger version of the action star it’s based on. Still, it’s no doubt a fun callback to a classic series that also comes with four Weapon Blueprints, a special finishing movie, the “Tracking…Tracking…” emote, “What Pain?” emblem, and “Lookin’ Fly” calling card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Terminator Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 2 crossover content doesn’t stop there. From February 6 to February 20, Warzone, Multiplayer, and Zombies players will enjoy The Terminator event, which sees players collecting skulls to unlock up to 13 rewards. This is in addition to two other events – Shadow Hunt and St. Patrick’s Day: Clover Craze – which will add even more unlockable upgrades in February and March, respectively.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tempest-rising-preview-an-rts-that-takes-me-back-to-the-90s<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As soon as I fired up the Tempest Rising demo for the first time, I had a good feeling. Watching the opening cinematic, which set the tone with cheesy dialogue from bulky armored soldiers and a reedy scientist, I couldn’t help but smile. The music, UI design, and units seem tailor-made to take me back to high school, when I’d stay up late playing Command &amp; Conquer with my friends, hopped up on Mountain Dew, taco-flavored Pringles, and sleep deprivation. Recapturing the feeling through a new game in the modern era is a blast, and I’m excited to see what else the developers at Slipgate Ironworks have in store at launch and beyond. Whether I was jumping into Skirmish to play against bots with clever AI, or Ranked Multiplayer, playing Tempest Rising feels as comfortable as putting on my well-worn baseball glove.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My initial reaction is no accident, either. The developers told me they <em>set out</em> to create a nostalgic real-time strategy (RTS) game that evoked the classics of the 90s and 2000s, with quality-of-life improvements expected of modern games. Set in 1997, Tempest Rising takes place in an alternate history in which the Cuban Missile Crisis exploded into World War 3. In the wake of widespread nuclear bombardment, strange flowering vines started to grow. These plants contain vast amounts of electrical energy, ushering in a new era of power for those prepared to withstand the fallout to harvest them.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tempest Rising Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the build I played was focused exclusively on multiplayer, I’ll have to wait to see what story mode will bring, but it will feature two replayable 11-mission campaigns, one for each of the main factions available in the preview. The Tempest Dynasty (TD) is an alliance of Eastern European and Asian countries who were the most devastated by WW3. The Global Defense Forces (GDF) on the other hand, are an alliance between the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. There is a third faction, but we’ll have to wait to learn more until the campaign is available, as they aren’t playable in the preview build, the Steam RTS Fest demo, or at launch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the two factions, the Tempest Dynasty called out to me, not just because they can create an incredibly silly ‘death ball’ vehicle called the Tempest Sphere, which rolls over enemy infantry, squishing them into a fine paste. The Dynasty also has access to something called ‘plans,’ which are used to activate faction-wide bonuses of three specific kinds. Your Construction Yard, the main building everyone starts with, can activate one plan at a time. All you need is a little extra power generation and, apart from the 30 second cooldown for switching plans, you’re good to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Logistics Plan let me build new structures faster and harvest resources more quickly. Mobile resource harvesters move more quickly, too. The Martial Plan boosted the attack speed of my units and gave them resistance to rockets and other explosives, as well as giving Machinist units the ability to drain their own health to gain 50% additional attack speed. Finally, the Security Plan cut the cost of making units and buildings, improved the Repair function certain units have, and expanded Radar vision. I found a fun rhythm by alternating between economy-boosting phases where I would gather more resources with the Logistics Plan, then sped-up building phases under the Security Plan, and finally going on the offensive with the enhanced combat potential of the Martial Plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This sort of flexibility extends to other aspects of the Dynasty, as well. Instead of having to establish a base with a Refinery to harvest nearby fields of tempest (like the GDF does), the Tempest Dynasty builds Tempest Rigs, vehicles which drive to a resource-rich area and harvest until the field is depleted, then are free to pack up and go somewhere else. Because of this, my favorite ‘fast expand’ RTS strategy is easier than ever, particularly because it doesn’t matter how far away from my base these self-contained units go. In fact, sending a few Tempest Rigs to faraway places was a great way to let them harvest in peace, generating reliable cash for me without being discovered by my opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dynasty also has a fun unit called the Salvage Van, which repairs nearby vehicles. It can, however, also be converted into Salvage Mode, which destroys nearby vehicles no matter who they belong to, giving resources back to the salvaging player. I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I love sneaking up on opponents who aren’t paying attention, parking a salvage truck next to their vehicles, and destroying them to both deplete their army and claim those resources for myself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, power plants created by the Dynasty can switch from power generation to ‘Distribution Mode’ which speeds up the construction and attack speed of nearby buildings (yeah, some upgraded Tempest Dynasty buildings have cannons. It’s awesome), at the cost of taking damage while the mode is active. Thankfully, the mode will stop affecting buildings at critical health, so I didn’t need to worry about destroying my own base for the speed boost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While I prefer the Tempest Dynasty, the GDF certainly has its allure, too. They focus more on buffing allies, debuffing enemies, and exercising control over the battlefield. My favorite synergy between GDF units revolves around the Marking mechanic. Certain vehicles and infantry can ‘mark’ the enemies they target. Marked enemies drop Intel when defeated (a currency used for creating advanced units and structures), but if you invest in certain Doctrine upgrades (Tempest Rising’s version of ‘tech trees’), Marked enemies will get various debuffs including dealing less damage, taking more damage, and even increasing the range of certain units who attack them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each faction has three tech trees to explore, which is where you’ll decide which part of your faction you’ll lean into. Like the GDF ‘Marking &amp; Intel’ tree, the Dynasty has a tree which boosts the effectiveness of their ‘Plans,’ and that’s just the start. In addition to fun tech trees,there are cooldown abilities enabled by constructing specific advanced buildings. They cost money to activate, and each has its own cooldown, but these abilities are powerful ways to swing the tide of battle while adding flavor to the type of strategy each faction excels at. While both factions have abilities which deal damage in an area, or spawn extra troops, the GDF can also create spy drones, spawn beacons to allow building in remote locations, and even stop enemy vehicles from being able to attack for 12 seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Dynasty has fewer buildings, with each basic building capable of being upgraded into the advanced version, losing a structure to an enemy Engineer can be rough. To counter that, the Dynasty has a special ability called Lockdown, which prevents enemy takeovers, but simultaneously stops the building from taking action. The Field Infirmary was the ability I got the most use out of, which let me drop a stationary troop-healing area anywhere on the map. This ability is a great compliment to the Dynasty, which already has both special infantry units and vehicles to repair mechanized allies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is more to dig into, and I can’t wait to do it, particularly because the launch version will let me jump into Custom Lobbies with friends, letting us team up against the very clever AI bots (which used impressive hit-and-run and harrying tactics on me during Skirmishes). Until then, I’ll have to settle for fighting alone, squishing my bot enemies with swarms of death balls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Brian Barnett writes reviews, features, &amp; more for</em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/Ribnax"><em> </em><u><em>IGN</em></u></a><em>, GameSpot, &amp; Kotaku.
