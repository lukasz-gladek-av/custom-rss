			<p>Today, Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room have released a trailer showcasing the characters from the Camarilla Court in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. If you've been wanting to get a closer glimpse into the characters from the game, this trailer shows you what you can expect from how the Kindred interact with players and how they move around the streets of Seattle. The characters all have drastically different personalities, with Benny being a stern character with a potty mouth. Tolly is a unique character with a big personality; Safia is forgetful and quaint, while Lou is demanding and ever-present.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - ‘A Betting Man’ Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2cXtEoGx7E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a short trailer just over a minute, the characters all get a brief showcase so you can see them in action, whether it be in combat or conversation with the characters mentioned. This trailer ties in nicely with Dev Diary 15, which was released in August, and discusses the Dialogue Choice system and how you will be able to interact with the different characters in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-dev-diary-explains-dialogue-choice-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We have already covered</a> this dev diary,&nbsp;</span>and we trimmed it down into bite-size pieces for you to read through.</span> Although the trailer showcases the characters ever so slightly, it doesn't provide much information about them other than their main traits and tiny glimpses into their interactions with others.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-dialogue-choice-systems" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dialogue choice system</a> that The Chinese Room have put in place, it gives you many different options on how you can interact with the characters in front of you and it's mentioned in the dev diary that they wanted to make sure that the choices didn't have any hidden dialogue or choices that may screw over your character unintentionally due to context not being added. This is something that can happen easily in story-based games, as sometimes prompts don't give the entire conversation, or the characters react in a way that seems totally unexpected.</p>
<p>Hopefully, as we get closer to the release date of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, we will get to see more of the Camarilla Court. Additionally, <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-camarilla-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary 16</a> was about the Camarilla Court and provided some additional context which can help you read between the lines from the short trailer that was provided today. The dev diary gives quotes from each of the characters, as well as an in-depth description of who they are and what role they play within the court.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween.1024551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-horror-games-to-play-this-halloween/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're looking to get stuck in with the scary season but aren't sure what games to play for <a href="https://wccftech.com/halloween-getting-unreal-engine-5-game-john-carpenter-involved/">Halloween</a>, this list compiles some of the best horror games that you can pick up. The list will include both indie games and triple-A for those who prefer a smaller-scale experience. Hold on to your hats, as this list features some of the best scares you can get on the market right now.</p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>Whether you play the original Silent Hill 2 or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> that was recently released, you're in for a good time. The Remake did a great job of keeping it authentic and much like the original, but added in some extra scares and puzzles to keep the game fresh. For the best experience, you'll want to play this game with headphones, as Bloober Team knocked the sound design out of the park. From Mary's little gasps to the possible chance of hearing whispering from the original, you're not going to want to miss out on all the easter eggs they've included in the Silent Hill 2 Remake.</p>
<h2>Outlast</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238320/Outlast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlast</a> is one of the classic horror games that most people play or try to play when diving into the horror genre. If you haven't played it already, you're missing out. Having to explore an abandoned asylum where the lights don't seem to work very often adds to the atmosphere. Combine that with having to use your video camera to be able to navigate and see your surroundings; it can get pretty intense.</p>
<p>Be warned, there is a ton of nudity and a lot of gore, so it may not be the horror game for you if you're the squeamish type.</p>
<h2>Crow Country</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crow Country</a> was released earlier this year and took the gaming world by storm. This was the perfect game to bridge the gap while waiting for the Silent Hill 2 Remake, as it takes place in a theme park, much like some of Silent Hill 3. It also features amazing PS1-style graphics, which are perfect for those who are looking for a hit of nostalgia in their horror. The style of the game is great for those who want to feel on edge and have a little bit of fear running through their veins but don't want to experience the realistic jumpscares that are found in more modernized horror games.</p>
<h2>Phasmophobia</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for an all-around comedic time with some friends, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phasmophobia</a> is the way to go. Of course, just because you're with friends doesn't at all mean you're safe, and you may find yourself getting jumpscared a fair few times. The game is quite goofy and is a lot of silly fun, but sometimes the silence is so thick it puts you on edge, especially if you're hunting ghosts by yourself. Make sure not to get killed by the ghost, and everything will turn out fine. Luckily, Phasmophobia just came out on console, so you can now play with your friends on PlayStation and Xbox if you're on PC!</p>
<h2>Alan Wake 2</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's pretty recommended to play the original Alan Wake games before jumping into <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, but you're in for a wild ride when you do get around to it. Not only are the graphics absolutely stunning, but there are more scares than ever. If you're a fan of survival horror, Alan Wake 2 is a great game to get stuck into. On top of that, it's perfect for those who love a twisty story, as there is certainly plenty of that.</p>
<p>The Lake House DLC just came out for Alan Wake 2 as well, so it's a perfect time to get stuck into the game with all of the DLC available. It will also get you excited for the upcoming title, Control 2. You can't go wrong with any of the Remedy Entertainment games, but Alan Wake 2 is certainly one you don't want to miss out on.</p>
<h2>Dead by Daylight</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight</a> is another perfect game to play with friends or family. Whether you're the killer and you're hunting them down, or you choose to survive along with your friends (or strangers), there's plenty of fun to be had. You're likely to spend the entire time on edge while trying to fix generators, only for the adrenaline to really get pumping if you miss a skill check on the generator.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are many iconic killers that you can find yourself running away from, including the beloved Xenomorph, Pyramid Head, and even Michael Myers. Dead by Daylight is highly accessible, too, as it's on every platform and is cross-play, allowing you to play with your friends who may be on a console while you're on PC.</p>
<h2>Alien: Isolation</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien: Isolation</a> is one of the most iconic horror games from modern-day gaming. First released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, the graphics were really ahead of its time. Even now, the game looks absolutely phenomenal, and you will be on edge as you explore the ship. There are plenty of moments for a false sense of security, and the Xenomorphs aren't the only thing you have to worry about on the ship with you.</p>
<h2>Still Wakes The Deep</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622910/Still_Wakes_the_Deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Still Wakes The Deep</a> is one of the more recent horror games to be released, and it certainly lived up to its name this year. If you're looking for a Halloween horror, this stunning and horrifying game is perfect for you. Taking place on an oil rig, you have to try and survive while dealing with the otherworldly creature to try and save yourself and your crew mates from certain death. If you have a fear of the ocean or deep sea creatures, you may want to avoid this one.</p>
<h2>Mouthwashing</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mouthwashing</a> is a recent release and is the perfect game to play for Halloween if you're looking for a game that is tense and confusing and has that PS1 surrealist vibe to it. It will leave you on edge and also feeling very confused about what's going on as you slowly uncover the story of the crewmates on the spaceship named Tulpar. The crew mates descend into madness, and you aren't far behind.</p>
<h2>Visage</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you're looking for a game that has a P.T. feel to it,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/594330/Visage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Visage</a> is the perfect game. Not only are there episodic stories for you to work through, but there are also puzzles and great sound design that will torment you long after you've completed the game. Visage is quite jumpscare-heavy at times and tackles a lot of difficult themes, but it is absolutely worth playing if you've got the time this Halloween.</p>
<h2>Little Nightmares</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/424840/Little_Nightmares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares</a> is the perfect horror game for those who are a bit sensitive to jumpscares and other elements you'd typically find in horror. It's scary without their heavy jumpscares and relies on great character design, storytelling, and puzzle-solving to keep you on edge. Little Nightmares also has some great DLC to accompany it, as well as a sequel if you find that you have enjoyed what's on offer from this title.</p>
<h2>Resident Evil 7</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>While a lot of the Resident Evil games focus on killing zombies and trying to fight for your survival against hordes of enemies and the like, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/418370/Resident_Evil_7_Biohazard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 7</a> goes down a more stereotypical horror route. You have to explore the grungy southern farmhouse and uncover a ton of horrifying secrets. The family you meet are not what they seem, and they are bound to have you on edge. If you find yourself enjoying Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village ties in nicely to 7 to finish the story.</p>
<p>That concludes our list of horror games to play for Halloween. What will you be playing this Halloween?</p>

The franchise has been in a bit of a lull lately, despite routinely setting new sales records, and this game especially needed to be a slam dunk given its unique position.

It almost seems like with every new entry of late the series has strayed from the desires of its outsized and fairly casual audience. <em>Call of Duty </em>is, after all, one of those games that most people pick up once a year and play till the next one comes along, much like a sports game. Folks who play those games tend to want refinements of core principles rather than drastic or convoluted reinventions.</p><p>All of which is to say, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s return-to-basics approach was a welcome bit of news among the cacophony of showcases, directs, and overbearing blog posts about why <em>this </em>game would be the best <em>Call of Duty </em>ever. After <em>MWIII</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005">flop of an open-ended campaign</a></span>, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>doubled down on having a cinematic, blockbuster story mode like the best in the series have offered. Its iteration on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562">Zombies feels like a healthy mixture of new and classic features</a></span> and mechanics. Even the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">multiplayer feels sensibly pared back</a></span>, and it restores tenets that fans have missed, like the prestige system. Treyarch and Xbox clearly want us to think that <em>Call of Duty </em>is “back,” but is it really?</p><p>According to the reviews that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is accruing on Steam, the answer’s a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no. Fans seem to generally agree that the campaign here is better than average, and some are even calling it the best story mode in a <em>COD </em>game in years. And of course there are players who have cherished the simplified renditions of both the competitive multiplayer suite and the cooperative Zombies mode, myself included. As is always going to be the case with a series this big and this polarizing, though, the more you look, the more people you’ll find who are disappointed in some of the game’s features.</p><p>One of the biggest problems many seem to have with <em>Black Ops 6 </em>actually has little to do with the game itself and more to do with the packaging, specifically the launcher, <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>. While the tool has been reworked since its initial release, it isn’t significantly better, and it seems to be even worse on PC, where fans of the series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502">seem to hate it more than I do</a></span>! One review joked that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is actually a “game is updating simulator.”</p><p>Elsewhere, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s various modes are causing division. Some are appreciating their time with the competitive multiplayer suite, but there are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799">repeated mentions of terrible maps and spawns</a></span> throughout the reviews. Having played the beta extensively, as well as jumping in after launch, I can kind of agree that there don’t seem to be any unilateral winners among the crop of multiplayer arenas available right now. Zombies has enjoyed a more positive reception than multiplayer, but still there are players who are unhappy with the settings and crying out for more ambient (spookier) maps in the future.</p><p>Overall, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>seems to be earning its “Mixed” reception on Steam. It isn’t the greatest game, but it’s a perfectly fine and fun middling title, and that’s about all I need from it to have a great time. The divisiveness surrounding the game is at least producing some good material in the Steam reviews page, though, so read it and weep. </p><figure id="" data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-recommend-id="image://f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-format="png" data-width="1248" data-height="480" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Campaign is pretty good and zombies is like Cold War with Classic features mixed in.

<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-ranked-play-release-date">Black Ops 6 Ranked Play release date</h2>



<p>Ranked Play will arrive in Black Ops 6 on<strong> November 14, 2024</strong>, which is also when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-battle-pass-release-date-season-one-pass-details/">Season 1</a> begins. As soon as the first season update lands for Black Ops 6, players will be able to dive in and start their competitive journey, where they’ll be progressing through ranks and playing against similarly skilled enemies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ranked-play-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ranked Play work in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.treyarch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Treyarch</a> will likely follow the same format as previous Ranked Play modes, with teams of 4 battling it out on a pool of carefully selected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/">maps and modes</a>. Players will have to build their loadout, working around restricted weapons, Perks, and Equipment in the Gunsmith. </p>



<p>The restrictions and rules are based on the Call of Duty League (CDL), the esports scene for the iconic FPS franchise. Players will climb <strong>Skill Divisions</strong>, which could be the same ones found in MW3, Bronze to Iridescent. As you win games, you gain Ranked Points that move you up these divisions, while if you lose the opposite happens.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-modes-are-in-black-ops-6-ranked-play">What modes are in Black Ops 6 Ranked Play?</h2>



<p>We expect Black Ops 6 to have <strong>Hardpoint, Control, and Search and Destroy</strong>, but Treyarch are yet to confirm the modes. This is based on the modes that were available in MW3’s Ranked Play, which we expect to be similar to BO6’s.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-ops-6-have-ranked-play-rewards">Will Black Ops 6 have Ranked Play rewards?</h2>



<p>We haven’t got much information regarding Black Ops 6’s Ranked Play just yet, but <strong>we assume that the mode will come with a reward system</strong>. Players will likely receive various rewards based on the Skill Division that they reach, the higher up the ladder they climb, the better the rewards. </p>



<p>If the rewards are similar to previous iterations of Ranked Play, you can expect to earn Calling Cards, Emblems, Weapon Skins, and more.</p>

                <p>In 2008, Liam Neeson reinvented himself as an action star in Taken, a story about a former CIA officer who went to great lengths to rescue his abducted teenage daughter. That movie appears to be one of the primary inspirations behind Indifferent Penguin's upcoming game, Tackle for Loss. But the unnamed hero of this game has his own set of unique skills to unleash on the people who dared to kidnap his daughter in Tackle for Loss' reveal trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bq_EOKUhVYY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bq_EOKUhVYY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the other inspirations for the game seems to be chronic traumatic encephalopathy--or CTE-- a neurological disorder that is often associated with concussions suffered by American pro sports athletes, especially football players. The lead character in Tackle for Loss is aware of his condition, and the violence that it brings out of him. There's also a touch of tragedy to his story, as he admits to not being able to remember his daughter's name. All he knows is that he loves her, and he'll get her back no matter how many bad guys he has to pulverize.</p><p>Tackle for Loss has a very retro visual style that seems reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hotline-miami-review/1900-6410681/" data-ref-id="1900-6410681">Hotline Miami</a>. The game does include some strategy by allowing players to unlock moves and upgrade their attacks as they progress through the story. Along the way, players will discover the truth behind the daughter's abduction and uncover a deeper conspiracy connected to the criminal underworld that took her.</p><p>German game developer Daniel Wichterich created Tackle for Loss by himself for his company, Indifferent Penguin. The game doesn't currently have a release date, but it is available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930270/Tackle_for_Loss/?curator_clanid=44965716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam's wishlist</a>.</p>

                <p>The debut of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass seemingly had a noticeable effect on engagement on Xbox, while the PS5 edition of the game saw a big jump as well in terms of active users. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l7swcxzmmr2l" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Call of Duty HQ app--which includes Black Ops 6, Warzone, and Modern Warfare III--was played by 52% of active Xbox Series X|S users and 34% of active PS5 players on October 28. That compares to 19% and 18% on October 23 for Xbox and PlayStation, respectively.</p><p>The 52% for Xbox and 34% for PlayStation figures represented all-time highs for Call of Duty HQ, according to Piscatella, who was citing Circana's own Player Engagement Tracker.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The previous highs for US daily active player engagement for Call of Duty HQ on Xbox Series X|S was 34% (August 31, 2024) and 27% on PS5 (September 7, 2024).</p><p>What does this all mean? Piscatella wants to see more data before drawing conclusions, but for now, he said it supports the idea that Black Ops 6 coming to Game Pass "very likely helped" improve engagement results on Xbox while also not significantly detracting engagement statistics on other platforms. "Still early, needs more data," Piscatella said.</p><p>"(And btw... over HALF of all daily active players on a platform playing one game [Call of Duty HQ] is bonkers engagement)," Piscatella said.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision previously announced that Black Ops 6 had the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">"biggest" three-day opening weekend in franchise history</a> for total number of players, hours played, and matches. It was also recently confirmed that Activision has now sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">more than 500 million Call of Duty games.</a></p><p>During an earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's release on October 25 set a record for new Game Pass subscriber additions on launch day, though he didn't offer a specific figure. Nadella <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1851744627226734807" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">went on to say</a> that Black Ops 6 sales on PlayStation and Steam were up "over 60% year-over-year" compared against 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p><p>Black Ops 6 expands this week with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">highly anticipated Nuketown multiplayer map on November 1</a>.

            <p>
PUBG Studios, the studio behind, yup, PUBG, has unveiled Project ARC, a new 5v5 PvP shooter viewed from a top-down perspective and featuring 'shared real-time line of sight'.
</p>
<p>
Project ARC is officially described a "realistic and fast-paced top-down shooting experience inspired by PUBG: Battlegrounds" that promises "skill-based, thrilling" gunfights - utlising the likes of assault rifles, submachine tunes, shotguns, snipers, grenade launches, and more.
</p>
<p>
Its shooting action is built around what publisher Krafton calls "widely-known bomb mission rules" (and, yes, I had to look that up), with teams either attempting to hack or defend a hidden crypt each game. The hacking team must blow up the walls surrounding the crypt to gain access and install a Decrypter device, while the defending team tries to stop them.

<p>
All this is viewed from a top-down perspective, with Project ARC also touting a shared real-time line of sight. "Modern warfare," explains Krafton, "[is] based on disrupting the enemy's line of sight, securing your view quickly, and attacking before the enemy notices you... Real-time line of sight shared with your teammates... creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates".
</p>
<p>
Project ARC's characters are all said to have their own preferred weapons and distinctive gadgets, with the latter including grenades, recon drones, grenade launchers, proximity explosives, and throwable items including flashbangs and smoke grenades.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release for Project Arc just yet, or even platforms <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/Project_ARC/">beyond Steam</a>, but you can take a look at its action in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hTTvybcp7o">announcement trailer</a> above.

                <p>It's been tough times of late at Sony Interactive Entertainment, as the PlayStation company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">began the year by cutting 900+ jobs and cancelling games. </a>In July, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">axed a number of positions from its Destiny studio, Bungie</a>, and announced a reorganization effort there. Then in August, Sony's Firewalk team launched a multiplayer FPS called Concord, only to close it quickly and offer refunds, before the studio itself <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">shut down for good</a> after reportedly spending $200 million+ on it. In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, SIE co-CEO Hermen Hulst reacted to these dramatic moves, saying they all took place as part of the company's effort to run a "sustainable business."</p><p>"I will say a few things on that. It's our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business," he said. "That's part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it's very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we've had some layoffs."</p><p>Hulst went on to say that the PlayStation Studios division is actually "much greater" today in terms of employment numbers than it was five years ago. "It's grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through [mergers and acquisitions]," he said.</p><p>Hulst's defense of Sony's major cuts sounds similar to what Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said about Xbox's own dramatic business shifts that included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">2,500+ layoffs in the past year and numerous studio closures.</a> In March, Spencer said the initial round of job cuts announced in January was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">necessary to help Xbox become a profitable business</a> following the blockbuster buyout of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>2024, like 2023 before it, has been a brutal for layoffs in the video game developers and staff at Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft, and many other companies. Some estimates suggest there have been more than 11,000 layoffs in the video game sector in 2024 alone.</p><p>A former PlayStation executive recently shared his thoughts on the cuts, claiming they are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. This executive, Chris Deering, was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p><p>A labor union, the Communication Workers of America (CWA), recently criticized Sony's decision to close Firewalk and shut down Concord, lamenting the kinds of decisions made by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/" data-ref-id="1100-6527505">"highly insulated video game CEOs."</a></p>

<section><p>Illfonic, Gun Media, and Boss Team Games have quickly become the go-to teams for translating classic horror movies into innovative video games.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Nearly a decade ago, in 2015, Gun Media and IllFonic were working together on Summer Camp, a horror game built to look like the slashers of a bygone era. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU-UTbmlQK0">announcement trailer</a> gives off strong Friday the 13th vibes, right down to the canoe wading through a (likely haunted) lake that surrounds the titular camp. No one knew it at the time, but this game would go on to ignite a spark in the video game horror space for years to come. Today, the trend of asymmetrical multiplayer horror games using licensed slashers and other Hollywood monsters still feels like it's only just begun.</p><p dir="ltr">Early on, Summer Camp was purely a homage; it was meant to recall the imagery of Jason's attacks on camp counselors through the '80s and '90s, but it wasn't officially attached to the IP. Around the same time, the Friday the 13th licensor group Horror Inc. and Crystal Lake Entertainment caught wind of the project during a period in which they had already been working with Steve Harris, today the CEO of Boss Team Games, and his partners at Diversion3 Entertainment to help find collaborators for a video game based on the IP. Summer Camp looked to be a great fit. Rather than a new slasher character meant as an ode to Jason Voorhees, what if the game could use the killer himself in his iconic hockey mask and all?</p><p dir="ltr">Harris and his partners approached Gun Media and asked if they'd be interested in changing its game from a clever homage to an officially licensed tie-in. Naturally, that was enticing for everyone. Following another investment round and a few more years of development, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/friday-the-13th-game-closes-with-800000-plus/1100-6432300/">hugely successful Kickstarter campaign</a>, Friday the 13th: The Game launched in 2017. Overloaded servers marred the game's early days, but it eventually grew to nearly 15 million lifetime players while bringing the many iterations of Jason to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside Dead By Daylight, launched just a year earlier, Friday the 13th revealed a burgeoning market for asymmetrical-multiplayer horror games. On one team, you have the killer, and on the other, you have several of his would-be victims--a natural fit with many horror franchises.</p><p dir="ltr">It's interesting to see what this subgenre looks like today and to estimate how it may look a few years from now, considering so much of the landscape is owed to a <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/18-3123/18-3123-2021-09-30.html" rel="nofollow ">landmark legal case</a> involving the Friday the 13th licensing rights and some of the original film's collaborators. First argued in court in 2020 and settled a year later, the outcome demanded that products using the Friday the 13th IP could no longer be sold or worked on. For Gun and IllFonic, this sadly included their game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393001" data-ratio="0.58506493506494" data-width="1540" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393001"></a><figcaption>Friday The 13th: The Game is, in some ways, the inception point for a trend that looks like it'll continue for years to come.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393001-4149604-f13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">DLC plans such as new maps, characters, and cosmetics were abruptly cut short; the game's post-launch support was no more. Effectively, it was snuffed out like one of Jason's victims in the shower; they never saw it coming. Both Gun and IllFonic were forced to move on to other projects, but because of their success with Friday the 13th, something else began to take shape.</p><p>From the cemetery plot of the Friday the 13th game, several more projects of a similar nature have sprung out of the ground: games like Gun's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, IllFonic's Predator: Hunting Grounds and Killer Klowns From Outer Space, and Boss Team Games' Evil Dead. Hollywood is increasingly interested in video games, and the people and teams that helped transpose Friday the 13th from film to a modern console and PC multiplayer game are being leaned on to make more magic happen with other icons of the horror genre.</p><p>Seeking to understand better how such deals are made, why they may sometimes fall through, and what else horror fans can expect to see in this emerging pocket of the games industry, I spoke to Steve Harris, CEO of publisher Boss Team Games, Wes Keltner, CEO of developer-publisher Gun Media, as well as Jared Gerritzen and Jordan Mathewson--chief design officer and design director, respectively--of developer-publisher IllFonic.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these talks, it became clear to me that licensing is sometimes a minefield that these horror-obsessed teams navigate nonetheless. Though it was a love of the genre that got them involved in the first place, they're now being viewed as the go-to creators when Hollywood comes calling with more horror icons in need of video game adaptations.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When A Licensor Calls</h2><p dir="ltr">"The appetite's there," Keltner told me. "Hollywood is starting to understand that video games are bigger than movies and music combined. I think, before, the conversations I was having, even in 2018, there were still film companies out there that were looking at video games as a way to market a movie. And obviously that's not how you do it."</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, on the Hollywood side, collaborators are too focused on the <em>next</em> part of a franchise, not what Gerritzen called "the beloved part," which may be the original, such as it is in the case of Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Other times, it may be a blend of parts, like with Friday The 13th: The Game, where many iterations of Jason are represented because he isn't really in the first movie and doesn't don his iconic mask until the third one. IllFonic would later use a similar approach with Predator: Hunting Grounds; in the game, the many versions of the titular creature span all of the movies and then some. The essential parts that make sense as a game can vary, but movie studios don't always envision those parts as important in the first place. </p><p dir="ltr">For "the better part of the last 15 years," Keltner said, movie studios have been involved in games but in a different way, and it's a way that studios like his and the others I spoke to aren't really interested in as much, if at all. "What they've been leveraging their IP to do is free-to-play mobile games" as a way of "supporting a movie that was about to come out," he continued. "And in their eyes, the cheapest way to do that and to get the maximum amount of eyeballs was to do a mobile game, make it free. And maybe it generates money, maybe it doesn't. But that wasn't their motivation, necessarily.</p><p dir="ltr">"So you had some folks that kind of understood video games, but they understood it from a mobile space. But what I've been seeing in the last few years is folks coming over, they've been at AAA publishers, and they're coming in and saying, 'Mobile is one facet. If your goal is just word of mouth to support a new movie, stick with mobile. It's probably not a bad idea. You're going to get it done faster. Gonna be a lot of eyeballs that won't cost as much. Go for it. But if your goal is to potentially create a whole new platform, where a new generation of people are going to experience this IP in a way they couldn't before, you need to start looking at console and PC. It's gonna cost more, it's gonna take longer, but the impact is 1,000 times what could have happened if you just made a mobile game.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner explained how his team has used Friday the 13th as a "case study" to bring to interested rights-holders from the movie world to demonstrate how a well-made video game can be the rising tide that lifts all proverbial boats for an IP. "You're going to see more people--a whole new generation of people--renting your movies, buying your movies, buying merch, looking for Halloween costumes. You're going to start trending on Instagram, TikTok--like, all this is going to happen from the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Harris added that the film industry has "caught on" to the enormity of video games, he told me. There's money to be made, and where that's the case, Hollywood is open for business. "Most of the studios," he said, "now have gaming divisions," naming MGM, Lionsgate, and Legendary as examples, who seek out the right developers to adapt their IP. "They understand what the process is, and they understand the challenges that we have from the development side and marketing side. But they're astute. They know what's involved."</p><p dir="ltr">IllFonic expressed the same. "There's just been a major amount of growth in the past few years of respect for video games," Gerritzen said. "Because when [Friday the 13th] happened, it was still that era of like, 'Oh, IP, slap a game together, make a game.'"</p><p dir="ltr">All three teams said the change seems to be driven largely by a generational divide. As older Hollywood executives have been filtered out for younger people who are more likely to have played games all their lives, these people have built bridges between the old guard within Hollywood and the game developers who are eager to bring their IP to life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393023" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393023"></a><figcaption>Gun's Texas Chain Saw Massacre was the first licensed horror PvP game to use a 4v3 setup.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393023-ss_3e8183bd7b7897405eb3503658af2a56533e1222.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"They're starting to see that there are passionate people in [the games industry] who are wanting to do a lot to elevate what they have into something that's going to attach to the generation of people who are much more into video games, and they're starting to understand it as the entertainment medium that it is," Mathewson told me.</p><p dir="ltr">The appetite is so strong, I was told, that these studios are more often being pitched <em>to</em> rather than proactively sending out feelers to see if they can get ahold of a beloved horror property. While Boss Team sometimes enjoys a more direct line to Hollywood given Harris' prior career in filmmaking, serendipity has been a reliable ally, too. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre game, for example, grew from Ian Henkel, son of the film's writer Kim Henkel, having played and enjoyed Friday the 13th. The younger Henkel wanted to see Gun's take on his family's IP, and a few years later, it exists--as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">one of the scariest games I've ever played</a>, no less.</p><p dir="ltr">IllFonic's Predator: Hunting Grounds has a similar origin story. Gerritzen said it started when the team "high-leveled" the game's concept one night. "The next day, [IllFonic CEO Chuck Brungardt] walks past a guy. He gets introduced to a guy from [20th Century] Fox, and he's like, 'Oh, we were just talking about Predator last night.' And then they talk, and he's like, 'Yeah, I just got a new creative director; his name's Jared.' And the guy knew me, and he's like, 'Oh, let's jump on a call next week.'"</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rosemary's Maybe</h2><p dir="ltr">But just having a line to communicate isn't enough to make a deal happen. Scheduling meetings eventually means negotiating, and sometimes those talks break down for a number of reasons.</p><p dir="ltr">"I would say a half-dozen to maybe 10 other horror IP [rights holders] have come to us that we had to politely decline. They just either didn't fit what we wanted to do, we didn't really feel that passionate about the property, or the terms that were being discussed were not conducive to our side really making any money," Keltner revealed. He gave an example of how an early meeting might unfold, telling the licensors, 'I want to take your movie. I want to turn it into a game like this. And here's what Gun does. Here's what we've done in the past. This is my budget, and this is the team that's going to work on it.'</p><p dir="ltr">"You find out whether or not it's going to fit right. And we usually get to the money, like, real fast, because that's usually what can throw everything off. Like, what are the terms of this deal? So you don't get into the nitty-gritty of the creative around the game. You always go for the big thing first, which is, like, 'What do you want? What cut do you expect from this,' you know?"</p><p dir="ltr">The snag, Keltner told me, is "almost always money or creative control." Gun had even made it to the prototyping stage with one project before it had to bow out. "That company wanted complete creative control and ownership of the code, and I'm like, 'You don't get that. That's not how this works,' you know? And they're like, 'Well, then we're not doing this deal.' And I go, 'Okay, see ya.' And we had to stop everything."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393025" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393025"></a><figcaption>Some horror icons have shown up all over games, like Ghost Face shown here in Hunt Showdown, but don't yet have their own games to call home.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393025-unnamed%289%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As Gerritzen has learned working at IllFonic, Hollywood behaves very differently from the games industry. In his mind, it operates more like a "giant quagmire" when it comes to ownership. "A game is an employer paying people. A movie is like a bunch of outsourcers, I'll say, or contractors. And it's like, 'Okay, well, anything that I make, I own because you want to pay me the cheapest.' Now, you have all these people owning different pieces of different things and all of that." In seeking the right partners to adapt IP, IllFonic has "gone through it all, really," he said. "And so now when we look at IPs, those are major factors that have to come into play [...] Is this free and clear? How many people are in it? We could talk about, 'Oh, man, wouldn't it be cool if <em>this</em>, and wouldn't it be cool if <em>that</em>?' And then you start to talk to people, and it's like, 'Oh, that's owned by 13 different people.'"</p><p dir="ltr">While doing research for this story, I learned that the licensor for the Scream franchise is not the same entity as the licensor for Ghost Face, the iconic mask worn by the killers throughout the film franchise. To my dismay, this seemed to be news to each of the teams I spoke to, which hinted to me that none of them are secretly making the asymmetrical Scream game I long for. But it also elicited varied reactions from the developers I met with. The idea of multiple licensors was sometimes seen as a red flag. But sometimes, having multiple licensors isn't the headache it might appear to be.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Evil Dead, there were five different licenses involved in that," Harris told me. "Frankly, I thought it would be more challenging than it ended up being. But you know, it was [about] coming up with an idea that allowed us to sort of very cleanly divide what we were doing with each of the [licenses] and got everybody on board with the idea that we were going to do this mash-up. And once everybody had signed off on that, it was pretty easy."</p><h2 dir="ltr">I Saw The IP Glow</h2><p dir="ltr">Even for those with proverbial scars from the Friday the 13th court drama, more recent and tidier collaborations have renewed the hope that this subgenre can survive Hollywood's IP quagmire. Keltner spoke highly of the Henkel family, who, in stark contrast to much of Hollywood's MO, exclusively owns the rights to the original 1974 Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The Henkels have worked with the studio to bring several new characters to the game based on a lore bible that the film's screenwriter, Kim Henkel, has kept for decades.</p><p dir="ltr">This allowed the team to expand on but remain faithful in spirit to the source material. It's even led to a new mode in the game called Rush Week in which Johnny, one of the characters exclusive to the video game, leaves the infamous Texas home to torment sorority sisters in the vein of an entirely different horror classic, Black Christmas.</p><p dir="ltr">That sort of freedom to take the IP and build something new is crucially important to the game makers, who need to know the film studios or other rights-holders will trust them and give them the space to experiment at times. Because both parties are fans of the IP, it's in everyone's interest to adapt it in a manner that feels true to the source, even when things stretch beyond a movie's original vision.</p><p dir="ltr">"We put [makeup effects artist and director Tom] Savini and Elvira into [Killer Klowns From Outer Space] and it was just like--this doesn't make sense, but they're [horror] royalty," Gerritzen said excitedly. "In Predator, we made female predators. In Ghostbusters, we added a ton of new stuff, talking spirit guides and all that. You have to know the IP before you start working on the IP. It's kind of like if someone were to come to IllFonic or me and say, 'Hey, I want to write a book about you,' or 'I want to do a documentary about you,' and they don't know anything about you. It's like, I'm not going to trust them to do this."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393026" data-ratio="0.56203164029975" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393026"></a><figcaption>Game studios working with licensed IP sometimes want licensors who grant them the latitude to mix things up in novel ways.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393026-killer-klowns-from-outer-space-elvira-tom-savini-novita.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because IllFonic has established itself as a major player in this space, licensors have come to trust the team with their IP more easily, usually thrilled to see what a game can add to the franchise in ways the movies never could. "Like, we're really massive horror fans," Gerritzen told me. "And, you know, I definitely think that the horror community is so welcoming to so much stuff [...] For us, it's like, we can do something really huge. We can do these things that would have blown their budget out of the water in most cases. And so for us, when we talk to the creators or the IP owners, and we get deep into it, most of the time they're beyond ecstatic that we're adding to their world and to their universe."</p><h2 dir="ltr">I Know What You Did Last Collab</h2><p dir="ltr">Working in the space of licensed asymmetrical horror games also comes with an added complication: Dead By Daylight (DBD). Behaviour Interactive's horror game has been the genre leader for years, even as its intentions are slightly different. Whereas games like Killer Klowns, Friday the 13th, and Evil Dead are bespoke, standalone games meant to capture the spirit of singular movies or franchises, Dead By Daylight is basically spooky Fortnite, with a roster of dozens of monsters--some original, but many licensed, too. The list of screen legends includes characters in these other teams' games, like Michael Myers and Leatherface, but also many others who haven't been given their own games (yet), like Chucky, Freddy Krueger, and my personal favorite, Ghost Face.</p><p dir="ltr">Harris told me the DBD question does come up at times, but that it usually isn't something that prevents a standalone experience existing alongside it. "I've had conversations with different rights holders [and asked] 'Well, if you do a Dead by Daylight character, or put it in Fortnite, or whatever it is, does that limit your ability to do a standalone game?' [...] I don't really think so. I think they're very distinct in terms of what they're trying to accomplish and how the games would play."</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner similarly cited how DBD brings in many iconic characters, but always does so in the context of the game's 4v1 mode (or the newer 8v2 mode) that involves starting noisy generators to open an escape path as killers stalk the map. DBD can fit almost any horror icon in its format, but it's always going to be in <em>its</em> format. "All the power to [Behaviour], because people love it," Keltner told me. "And we went down this other route, which was cinematic and true to the one, singular IP. So instead of trying to be the Swiss army knife where you can take any IP and stick it in this thing, we wanted to concentrate on, 'Let's make the complete Jason experience.' And seeing those two avenues, I think Hollywood looked at that and went, 'Oh, wow, look what you could do.' You could leverage single characters, or you could take the entire IP and try to make a game based on it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393027"></a><figcaption>Dead By Daylight has helped shape the genre, even as it intends to do something different than most of its genre counterparts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393027-screenshot_3_33879d7bc3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asymmetrical games just provide this perfect chemistry when you're trying to bring these things to life," Mathewson said. "Because I think we all recognize there's a really substantial cross-pollination between the fanbases of these types of movies and people that like to play games. And we are <em>them</em>. We grew up with these things, and we had that connectivity and really resonated, you know, at a younger age. And now, we're getting to this point, we're making games, and we have access to this new game type that really fits in well with these different IPs."</p><p dir="ltr">Being the subgenre's busiest, most-called-upon studios could also drive competition amongst the teams. Perhaps when you're operating at the level of popular FPS or sports games, that's truer. But the people I spoke to only had nice things to say about their peers from other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's rival schools," Gerritzen said. "Like, that's all it is. It's not like Halo versus COD type of stuff. You know, it's fun. It's a lot of fun."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm ride-or-die for IllFonic," Keltner told me. "We've been in the trenches. We spent five years together [on Friday the 13th]. I mean, you get to know every lead and every person under their lead, and their wives' names, and you're hanging out at their studio, you're getting pizza and beer with them at night, you're setting up at three in the morning waiting for the build to cook, and you're just telling stupid stories so you don't fall asleep. I mean, it's just, they are bros, through and through, right? So anytime I see them get [an IP], I'm the first cheerleader. I never look at it like, 'Oh, dang it. I should have [gotten] that' or whatever. And I want to work with them again, 100%."</p><p dir="ltr">"We're all off working on different things and trying to bring new experiences into the world in slightly different ways," Harris said. "I would have loved to do something with Predator, but IllFonic did it. They may have wanted to do something with Texas Chain Saw Massacre, but Gun did it. So fortunately, if you look at the products that are coming out, we're all trying to be very faithful to the source material. We're trying to advance gameplay within the asymmetrical space. And you know, as long as we have some success in doing that, I think the real winner there's the player."</p><h2 dir="ltr">House Of 1000 Concepts</h2><p dir="ltr">Harris' words spoke to one other insight I sought from each of the teams: their horror IP wishlists. Let's imagine, I told them, there is no quagmire. They can have any IP. They're all open and willing to collaborate. Which series do they reach for first? The answers were excitingly diverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Keltner named several that have been stirring in my mind for a while too, such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing. "I also have a soft spot for Return of the Living Dead, just because it was a very different, very punk, very nihilistic approach to making zombie stuff. And it just felt like it carved right through pop culture to where now people say 'braaaaaiiins' and that didn't exist before that movie." He named one more too, presumably knowing it's spoken for: Halloween. Though Boss Team recently published RetroRealms Arcade--retro-style platformers based on Halloween and Ash vs. Evil Dead--the team has also revealed a second Halloween game is in the works, built in Unreal Engine 5.</p><p dir="ltr">Specifics about the gameplay or its genre beyond being a horror project have not been revealed yet, but it would stand to reason it may be something like the asymmetrical games we've seen to date. Curiously, the folks from IllFonic were cagier in naming specific IP on their wishlist, laughing off the question and insinuating that perhaps one or more of the franchises that would be on their wishlists has already been checked off but not yet revealed publicly.</p><p dir="ltr">Joked Mathewson, "I tried to think of something, but yeah, it's a no-win scenario." Whether IllFonic is Boss Team's partner on the upcoming Halloween game, I can't say for sure. But Mathewson did note that IllFonic has no plans of exiting this space any time soon. "We're going to use everything that we've built up to this point to continue to thrive, to bring everything to a new level, because we love games," Mathewson added. "We love these types of games specifically, too, and we feel like there's a lot more to add to it, and we're going to keep doing it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4393028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4393028"></a><figcaption>A Nightmare on Elm Street's dream setting seems like it would be conducive to crafting interesting new gameplay hooks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393028-3897432-dek-freddy.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Harris and Keltner said similar things, though everyone stressed the need to keep pushing the genre forward. If these asymmetrical horror games feel too similar, you'll lose everyone but the "5%" of players, Kelter said, who are the "horror nerds" like those within these studios and who would play them anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">"Anything can become oversaturated, but I think that reflects back on ourselves and the other companies that you mentioned, always advancing that genre of games," Harris told me. "Otherwise, it will just become stale. I mean, if you're not doing something new--put the IP aside for a second--if you're not making a game that's offering players something new, then there's not a point in doing it."</p><p dir="ltr">For Keltner, it's about aligning his team's vision with IP partners who can match their zeal. "What are their goals? What do they want to achieve? I want authenticity. I want a white-glove approach. I want interesting design. I want forward-thinking design. And I want horror nerds who are not going to leave any stone unturned, and that it's something that, hopefully, can stand the test of time."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends Bans Linux, Leaving Steam Deck Out in the Cold]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-bans-linux-leaving-steam-deck-out-in-the-cold.1024482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and developer Respawn have announced that&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>can no longer be played on Linux operating systems, potentially leaving Steam Deck players out in the cold without a workaround.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/article/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an update posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Respawn puts the decision down to a desire to maintain "competitive integrity" in&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The developer says Linux is a "path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=llo29sIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=gzFlRQtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Linux&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>player, Respawn has bad news for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Respawn admits that the&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Linux population is "small", but the "impact" of those players "infected a fair amount of players' games".</p>

<p>Addressing the issue in a more nuanced way would have required an "outsized level of focus and attention" given the Linux platform's size, so the decision was made to ban Linux outright instead. This decision takes effect "immediately", too, so you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>on Linux anymore.</p>

<p>If, however, you decide to install Windows on your Steam Deck, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>that way. If you prefer to play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>directly from your Steam Deck's OS, however, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This also won't affect&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>players who are playing on Steam via Windows platforms, nor, of course, those who are playing on console or anywhere else (unless that "anywhere else" happens to be a PC running Linux, of course).</p>




<p><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>has run into problems with cheaters in the past.</p>

<p>Back in March, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-global-series-hack">bizarre hacking incident</a> saw professional&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>players being hit with a hack that injected various unfair advantages into their games, including wallhacks and aimbots. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/someone-is-repeatedly-breaching-apex-legends-accounts">not the only time</a> the game has run afoul of cheating and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-hacked-with-save-titanfall-message">hacking</a>, either.</p>

<p>This announcement also comes shortly after Valve announced that developers who want their games to be on Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure">must declare</a> whether their titles have kernel-level anti-cheat mechanisms in place.&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>is one such game; it uses the popular Easy Anti-Cheat software.</p>

And now Panic has confirmed that a second season is coming at some point in 2025.</p><p>As for what will be included, we don’t have a lot to go on right now. Panic says that “details on price, the exact number of games, and the developers behind the games of season 2 will come in 2025.” But during a livestream today, the company said it would probably feature “about a dozen games” and will also include a “really cool surprise.”</p><p>Last year Panic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a Playdate store called Catalog</a> where developers could release games outside of the season structure, and during today’s presentation the company said that the shop had surpassed 200 available games. We also got a glimpse at some titles in development, including the adorable word game <em>Bwirds</em> (launching November 26th), a grappling hook-powered platformer called <em>Owlet’s Embrace </em>(later 2025), the cozy puzzle adventure <em>Comet </em>(listed as coming soon), and the self-explanatory <em>Office Chair Curling</em> (also coming soon).</p><p>You can check out the full presentation for more on these games:</p><p>There’s also some good news on the hardware front: Panic said that the hard-to-find handheld is available to order now with an expected shipping date of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a series of images showcasing the in-progress rework of Customs, one of the most iconic and popular maps in the pioneering extraction shooter title. It has been years since Customs was first added to the game, and it already been altered a few times, but this latest change is nothing short of an overhaul.</p>



<p>Check out the images below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mad-changes">Mad Changes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games is taking Customs and turning it on its head, implementing some major changes that’ll make it seem like an entirely new map. That’s what the team did recently with Factory, adding new areas and adjusting what was existing to make it feel much bigger and more detailed.</p>



<p>The latest images reveal the opening of buildings that were previously inaccessible, or adding extra details to those that were. </p>

<p>It looks like the Repair Shop and the area around it have been upgraded immeasurably, and some of the smaller interiors around the Scav Checkpoint have been altered. Further underground portions have been added, which will add more depth to the relatively one-dimensional map. </p>



<p>Battlestate flicked through <strong>many </strong>changes coming to Escape from Tarkov in the next and future updates, including a rework to hipfire and ADS mechanics, winter clothing, new weapons, and an array of grenades and attachments. It’s a tasty package, that’s for sure.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-zombies-halloween-event/</link>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s super-spooky Halloween event is live now, and it’s forcing players to contend with bloodthirsty zombies on Labs. As if the map wasn’t tough enough already, the latest update has pumped the undead into The Lab, and entry to the map, which is usually locked behind a keycard, is free.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-and-loaded">Locked and Loaded</h2>



<p>If you’re heading to Labs, you’ll need to go loaded for action – zombies are running rampant and taking no prisoners.</p>



<p>Because zombies don’t really do that.</p>



<p>When you enter the map, you’ll be hit by a blast of radiation that doesn’t dissipate and surprise, surprise – there are no gas masks to be found anywhere within easy reach. </p>



<p>Presently, it seems like there are no special tactics involved in taking them down, but they are tanky. It’s best to go with the age-old tactic of shooting them in the head with some large-calibre weapons if you want the most successful journey through the map.</p>



<p>Players are still discovering the event as we speak, so more secrets may be revealed as the night goes on and Halloween hits in earnest.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Escape from Tarkov and are eager to explore the Halloween update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This remake of Pokemon Yellow mixes in Pokemon Go-esque catching mechanics and places the Pokemon on the map, removing random battles as a result. It's a more streamlined experience, but it's still a great way to revisit the Kanto region.</p><p>One quirk about shopping for Switch games at Woot these days is that you <strong>aren’t guaranteed to receive a North American version</strong> <strong>of physical titles</strong>. Nintendo Switch is region-free, however, so if you’re sent a UK or Japanese version, you’ll still be able to play it in English without any issues. If you decide to purchase DLC, just make sure you’re purchasing the DLC for the region of the game--for example, if you’re given a UK version of Pokemon Scarlet, you’ll need to use the UK eShop to purchase The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Available Ahead Of This Week's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/targets-exclusive-shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-is-discounted-just-weeks-after-its-release/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-and-peach-starter-sets-get-first-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">New Lego Super Mario And Peach Starter Sets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-movie-tv-series-box-set-collection-amazon-halloween-deals/1100-6527353/">Best Horror Movie 4K Box Sets And Steelbook Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-limited-time-amazon-deals-all-6-dune-books-for-38-4k-box-set-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6527343/">Dune Limited-Time Amazon Deals - All 6 Dune Books For $38, 4K Box Set For Lowest Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> is one of the only battle royale games that lets you play on a Steam Deck gaming handheld — <em>Fortnite, Valorant, PUBG</em> and more never supported it in the first place, citing concerns about anti-cheat. But today, Electronic Arts and Respawn are taking the game away for that very same reason. </p><p>“In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,” writes EA, <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">in a blog post explaining the decision</a>.</p><p><em>Apex Legends did</em> have anti-cheat software that <em>did</em> run on the Steam Deck — specifically, the game uses Epic Games’ Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), which has been compatible with the Linux gaming handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">for over three years now</a>. But that wasn’t good enough for Epic Games’ own <em>Fortnite — </em>Tim Sweeney explained that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">the “threat model” was too large in 2022</a> — and it’s apparently no longer good enough for EA now.</p><p>“Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention,” EA writes today.</p><p>Riot Games has similar concerns. Like many competitive multiplayer game developers, it also doesn’t support <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em> on Linux due to the increased possibility of cheating. In a recent interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Phillip Koskinas, director of anti-cheat on <em>Valorant</em>, discussed why game developers are shying away from Linux support. </p><p>“You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,” says Koskinas. “You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.”</p><p>Linux is so open that you can run an emulated version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> right now on a Steam Deck and still have a cheat on the device. “Imagine if Steam Deck just has the security handled so we know it’s a genuine device, it’s fully attested, all these features are enabled, we’d be like cool, go game, no problem” says Koskinas.</p><p>As usual, it’s not clear if this is mostly a Linux problem, or mostly a problem of needing to spend more money on creative solutions than the small number of players might be worth. Last December, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told us he <em>could</em> possibly justify putting <em>Fortnite</em> on the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">if it had “tens of millions of users” there</a>, and EA writes today that it weighed its <em>Apex </em>decision based on the “small” population of Linux players versus how “their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games.”</p><p>EA says you’ll still be able to play <em>Apex Legends</em> on a Steam Deck if you install Windows. Valve still hasn’t released its own dual-boot installer to make putting Windows on a Steam Deck easier — the feature has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954455/the-ability-to-dual-boot-windows-is-still-high-on-the-list-of-steam-deck-priorities">“high on the list” for some time</a> — but it has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot#:~:text=Yang%20on%20that%3A-,As%20for%20Windows,-%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20preparing%20to">plugged some of the big holes</a> in its Windows drivers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Gaider recently spoke to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s Robert Purchese, aka The Lovely Bertie, about how he and BioWare came up with the setting. The result is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">a jolly article on world-building</a>, from which I have dutifully plucked out some intriguing snippets.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Gaider asserts the importance of doubt and free interpretation when unearthing the history of Thedas. "To get the truth, you kind of have to pick between the lines," he says in the piece. This is especially true of the oldest tales about the setting's origins and in particular, the Fade, an engulfing dimension that is the source of magic. "In general, the further the history goes back, we always would purposefully obfuscate it more and more, make it more biased and more untrue no matter who was talking, just so that the absolute truth was rarely knowable," Gaider goes on. "I like that idea from a world standpoint, that the player always has to wonder and bring their own beliefs to it."
</p>
<p>
As Bertie points out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> could be a big step towards resolving Gaider's original "uber-plot". Without giving away too much, one story theme is the return of a bunch of ancient Elven gods who can remember the early days of Thedas. I have yet to play The Veilguard myself - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Nic's review is here</a> - but in theory, those fey antiques are in a position to clear up any disagreement about, say, the precise nature of the ethereal Black City that supposedly once harboured the world's creator. 
</p><p>
"Yeah, we have access to people who can tell us the truth from first-hand experience," Gaider comments, "although again, it depends on what the writers did with it." He's interested to discover whether Bioware have continued the "tradition" of leaving players in doubt about the fundamentals. Interested and perhaps a bit alarmed. 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, will they one day definitively tell you about the Maker? Will we crack the big mysteries of the world and just make them answered finally? And does that ruin one of the central precepts that Dragon Age is founded upon? Maybe. Ultimately, that lore, when you make it big and you hint at it and hint at it and hint at it, it becomes a Chekhov's Gun of sorts. Eventually you got to pony up."
</p>
<p>
I like fantasy worlds that offer me a spectrum of competing lies, with truth inevitably found in the eye of the Beholder. While I'm not above the lure of a fully filled-out codex, I've always felt it's a shame that so many RPGs default to treating the setting like an unlockable encyclopedia, where clarity and certainty are simply a question of putting the hours in. Mind you, I also think it's a shame that so many RPGs keep you guessing about certain world and narrative threads, in order to leave room for sequels or expansions. Much like Dragon Age, I am an inconsistent being. Anyway, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-today-and-players-are-celebrating-the-famous-bioware-turn">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out today, and apparently people are going nuts about turns</a>.

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The staff and contributors that make up Remap play all sorts of video games, and you hear us talk about most of them on weekly episodes of Remap Radio. But even with nearly three hours of banter, some games don’t make the cut, or simply do not fit into the flow of conversation. We also don’t do a lot of “reviews” here at Remap, so we needed to find something that fit in-between.</em></p><p><em>Every month, Remap Recommends is a chance for each of us to sit back and reflect on a game that’s continued to sit with us, to the point that we want to tell you, in writing, why it’s interesting.</em></p><p><em>These aren’t traditional reviews. They’re not long essays. This is “Hey, check this out. I liked it.”</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends%E2%80%A6unsorted-horror">Patrick Recommends…<em>Unsorted Horror</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2433730/Unsorted_Horror/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="http://itch.io/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>itch.io</u></a>)<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Short Form Horror<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Number of Jump Scares: </strong>Three<br><strong>Spiders?: </strong>No comment</p><p>I have an affinity for short form horror specifically because it squeezes out what crushes most scary stories in longer formats: characters. A clever idea, or creepy design for a monster, has trouble holding up over the course of two hours without decent characters to string you along. Characters can elevate gimmicks to something special. But sometimes, one good idea, or good twist, can be enough! </p><p>In <em>Unsorted Horror</em>, an anthology series of interactive horror shorts, you are not experiencing hours of tension and release. You’re spending 15 or 20 minutes in one of five vignettes determined to make you squirm. It doesn’t have to justify a skill arc for the character, or a series of interactions that need to feel good seven hours from now. It turns the screws quickly, before hitting you with a singular relief: the credits. </p><p>Finally released, you can move onto the next set of nightmares.</p><p>P.S. If you're looking for good horror short story anthologies, my favorites include Clive Barker's <em>Book(s) of Blood</em> and Stephen King's <em>Skeleton Crew</em>. The latter includes King's horrifying <em>The Jaunt</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-football-tactics-glory">Rob Recommends… <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375530/Football_Tactics__Glory/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>)<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics, sports<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> 4<br><strong>Offsides Called:</strong> 12</p><p>A month or so ago, we had a long conversation on the podcast about how we wished there were more sports games that had space to go wild with the concept and embrace the weirdness that is often sanded-down in officially licensed games. That led to a brief interlude where we were delving deep in Steam to look at sports games from further afield than the likes of EA Sports and super crunchy management sims. One of the things that caught my eye was <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em>. The Steam page pithily describes it as “XCOM meets Football Manager” and that’s pretty much accurate and it’s as cool as it sounds.</p><p>The game slowly layers in complexity via a long tutorial, and one of the things that distinguishes it from <em>XCOM </em>is that your footballers move a bit more like chess pieces than squaddies do in <em>XCOM</em>. Certain players are able to do special movements and maneuvers just by virtue of what positions they have been assigned, so the same guy can do things as a wing that he can’t do as a defender, even if his stats are appropriate for both. On the other hand, every player learns special abilities that they <em>can </em>take with them no matter where on the pitch they are playing.</p><!--members-only--><p>It‘s a <em>lot </em>to keep track of, to be honest, and I think it’s harder for me because I don’t have an intuitive sense of soccer’s logic. <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>relies a lot on that across its tutorial-packed opening hours. But it’s also an incredibly charming and rewarding game. Seasons change as you play, the stadiums you play in get fancier as you climb the ladder into serious professional play, and you watch your hopeless little rookies slowly develop competitive identities that turn them into superheroes on the pitch.</p><p>It’s also, frankly, a game that seems to resist becoming rote in the way that some tactics games do. Because so many plays require precise positioning, and the only way to get enough actions to complete your set-pieces is to use your players’ special abilities successfully, each turn feels a bit more like you are solving a chess-puzzle. Think more <em>Into the Breach </em>or <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> for how you have to plan your attack.</p><p>People who know soccer better could probably tell me how right or wrong I am on this score but <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>feels like it is actually a pretty brilliant interpretation of soccer, and one whose rules and mechanics do a lot to teach the intricacy of the beautiful game.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-the-jackbox-survey-scramble">Cado Recommends... <em>The Jackbox Survey Scramble</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image f</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>), <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/the-jackbox-survey-scramble?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Basically Every Console</u></a><br><strong>Genre: </strong>Party Game<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Volume When Yelling at My Team During Bounce: </strong>+20 dB<br><strong>Schmitty?: </strong>No, thankfully</p><p>It’s honestly a bit of a surprise that Jackbox has taken this long to hop on the “Family Feud” style survey based games, about as surprising as the way this game seemed to stealth drop this month. It’s almost like Jackbox was trying to scrub everyone’s collective memory of that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2652000/The_Jackbox_Naughty_Pack/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>unfortunate pack</u></a> they dropped last month that was rightfully lambasted for grossly misunderstanding why it’s fun to put obscenities into Quiplash. It’s not funny when the cum jokes make sense in context!</p><p>In Jackbox Survey Scramble, you and your friends are treated to four different survey based games, all with slightly different setups but seemingly pulling from the same pool of survey material. The sets range from opinion based questions like “What is something that you could crush in your hands” to the more subjective brand of “My Ex thinks I’m …” with one common thread: every answer can only be one word. The games themselves have you either trying to guess what’s at the very top or very bottom of the list for points (HiLo) to trying to fill in as much of the list as possible (speed), to breaking your group into teams for versions of Tic Tac Toe (Squares) and Breakout (Bounce) that have you using the range to try and place your team’s X/O/Paddle in just the right place.</p><p>I had a ton of fun with all of these games aside from speed, which requires a focus that has you head down and not interacting with the people around you, a failure as far as party games are concerned. The team games in particular are really great and had a ton of opportunities for chatter and teamwork with really hilarious arguments over whether something comes higher or lower on the list. Do you think babies or depression are higher on the list of “things that make you cry?” Like a lot of good Jackbox games, the correct answer doesn’t even matter, it’s all delicious fodder for jokes, arguments, and good times with friends.</p>

The only thing standing between the surviving trio and having their greatest desires granted is one last trial and the looming presence of Agatha’s newly revealed ex, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598">Death</a></span> (Plaza). The first half of the two-part finale focuses on this trial, which asks the witches to make something grow in a concrete and metal enclosure bereft of life.</p><p>Despite having twice as long to tell the end of its tale, however, <em>Agatha All Along</em> rushes through the end of the Witches’ Road. This results in Jen, whose story about being mysteriously bound a century ago has been teased for several episodes, getting a quick bow tied to her whole arc and being sent away with little fanfare. It’s a deflating moment, as the show has implied that this is some big thing waiting to be revealed, but when the only revelation is that Agatha accidentally bound Jen in the past for some quick cash, it goes nowhere and the two resolve their differences in a couple of minutes. Jen has never been one of the strongest characters on the show, and concluding her arc with this haphazard ending a week after Patti LuPone delivered the show’s best performance in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675">defining episode</a></span> is a major misstep.</p><p>Once Jen is out of the picture, <em>Agatha All Along</em> is free to refocus on its greatest aspect, the relationship between Agatha and Billy. With death seemingly imminent for the two as they can’t pass the trial, Agatha is able to help Billy connect with his powers and discover where his lost brother is, thus fulfilling the wish that led him to the Witches’ Road and sending him to safety, leaving Agatha alone to die. This moment also leads to the show’s most gut-wrenching revelation: Agatha’s son wasn’t sacrificed by her on the Witches’ Road at all, he just died. When Kathryn Hahn quietly tells Billy that sometimes boys just die, it’s a heartbreaking confession that there is no power in the world that can keep death away. </p><p>But as this is a Marvel property and we aren’t even through the first half of this finale yet, we can’t end on that emotional note. The climax of part one devolves into another special-effects-heavy brawl as Death and the team of Billy and Agatha fire different colored magical blasts at each other. Until now, <em>Agatha All Along</em> has largely steered clear of action, instead choosing to focus on interesting puzzles the coven has to face in each trial. Trading all that originality in for action that makes your eyes glaze over just made me wish the show would end as quickly as possible.</p><p>Thankfully, the show comes to an end quick enough. Agatha chooses to sacrifice herself in order to save Billy, which she does by sharing a passionate kiss with her longtime lover, Death, that immediately leads to Agatha keeling over and dropping dead. It’s nice that we actually got a kiss between Plaza and Hahn in the show as they’ve played their characters as explicitly queer, but it’s almost laughable that Agatha is killed off immediately after this display in what has to be one of the most eye-rolling cases of “kill your gays.” Oh, and we actually have a whole other episode to get through!</p><figure id="" data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might wonder what there is left to wrap up, the show’s titular character just died! But part one ends with the reveal that the Witches’ Road was conjured into existence by Billy’s powers unconsciously turning his dreams into reality. It’s a reveal that fans had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479">already clocked</a></span>, but one that still feels like a cheap trick that does nothing but take away meaning from what has largely been an excellent show.</p><p>Yet before we even get to that, the last episode of <em>Agatha All Along</em> begins with a lengthy flashback that reveals the story of Agatha’s son, Nicholas. It turns out that the boy was fated to die in childbirth, until Agatha pleaded with her lover to spare his life. All deals have a price, of course, and Death warned Agatha that his time would still be limited. Naturally Agatha and Nicholas live a fairly happy life for a few years, until one night Nicholas dies in his sleep. What’s supposed to be a window into Agatha’s soul at her most vulnerable, however, feels instead like padding to a finale that has already overstayed its welcome. Marvel projects, on both the big and small screens, seem to think subtlety is the enemy. This is just another example of that mentality, as the single quiet moment between Billy and Agatha in the first part of the finale contains exponentially more meaning and power than this extended sequence. Instead of “show, don’t tell,” Marvel chooses to show and show and keep showing until they’ve beaten you over the head with the awareness that this should be sad. A parent outliving their child is inherently tragic, of course, but stretching this emotion to its limit has diminishing returns.</p><p>As its final and grandest reveal, <em>Agatha All Along</em> reframes everything we’ve seen before in a much poorer light. Rather than really being a show about Agatha, this is first and foremost Billy’s show. The deaths of every other coven member (minus Jen, who survives) are just footnotes in his origin story. To justify the show’s choices, Agatha appears to Billy to act as his debate partner one more time, now in the form of a ghost—perhaps the most egregious example yet of Marvel so clearly being unwilling to commit to killing off a fan-favorite character despite the death it wrote them into. Like the show has stated before, this whole journey just shows that Billy is a killer just like his mother, one who is unable to control his dark powers. Just like the dead coven members who are nothing more than fodder for Wiccan character growth, the entirety of <em>Agatha All Along</em> feels like one more Marvel project that isn’t meant to stand on its own but is instead fodder for the grand MCU machine. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a fitting reveal for Halloween, NetherRealm Studios has revealed the first look at gameplay for Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1. The gameplay was revealed by franchise co-creator Ed Boon on <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1851993028170219571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>.</p>



<p>Ghostface, for those who don’t know, is the main antagonist from the popular Scream series. What makes them so unique is that it’s never the same person under the mask in the movies. In total, there have been 14 people behind the mask.</p>



<p>In the clip, which you can see below, Ghostface fights Johnny Cage. They have their distinct voice-changer that keeps their identity hidden while also equipped with a knife.</p>



<p>Ghostface will be available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting November 19 for those with Early Access. Everyone else can start slashing away on November 26.</p>

<p>Ghostface is just the latest fighter to be added to Mortal Kombat since the game’s release in September 2023. He is the 10th overall addition, and a part of the game’s Kombat Pack 2. Future additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster will include Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2.</p>



<p>NetherRealm will announce those releases at a later date. Whether there will be a Kombat Pack 3 also remains to be announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ghostface coming to Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for the best SWAT 5.56 loadout in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, we have recommended the ideal attachments, Perks, and Equipment to deal the maximum damage.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best SWAT 5.56 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Attach the <strong>Suppressor</strong> for reduced gunfire sounds and to hide yourself from the minimap. The <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> will drastically reduce horizontal recoil, so that will come in handy while using this DMR.</p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will increase the damage range while the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will improve the aiming speed of the weapon. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will increase the fire rate of the weapon but comes at a cost of reduced damage range, horizontal and vertical recoil control, and bullet velocity.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best Specialty for the SWAT 5.56 and to get that, use Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time in the respective Perk slots. This will give you a temporary buff to your movement speeds and health regeneration rate.</p>



<p>You can equip the <strong>Perk Greed </strong>Wildcard and keep <strong>Dexterity</strong> in the fourth Perk slot for reduced weapon motion while jumping, sliding, or diving.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon option for the SWAT 5.56 is <strong>Grekhova</strong> as this fully automatic pistol will add more firepower to your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is unlocked immediately and you can start creating custom loadouts after reaching <strong>player level 4</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is a decent weapon choice as there are better options available. The things that set this weapon back are its slow TTK and mobility – two crucial aspects of multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> is a great alternative to the SWAT 5.56 in BO6. However, if you want full-automatic options, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> are two meta weapons you can use right now.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the two CEOs at the top of Sony Interactive Entertainment, appeared in the same chat for the first time since being appointed. It’s not the most conventional way to run a company, but Sony’s CEO believes it’s a recipe for success.</p>



<p>Hulst manages the studio side of things while Nishino oversees the platform operations. In a recent chat with Variety, the pair was grilled about all things PlayStation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-our-duty-to-run-a-sustainable-business">“It’s Our Duty to Run a Sustainable Business”</h2>



<p>In Variety’s interview, the pair of CEOs first addressed the PS5 Pro, the next iteration of the PlayStation 5 that’s emerging at a very sketchy time for Sony. In recent months, the company has suffered under the weight of layoffs, studio closures, and scrutiny regarding the pricing point for this new powerhouse of a console.</p>



<p>Despite that, Hideaki Nishino remains optimistic:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launches — it was another five-year project for us.</p>



<p>… we’re kind of happy to see, like most engaged gaming users are interested in the PS5 Pro, and then I’m pretty sure new users will grab the PS5 Pro as well. If it’s the PlayStation you want to get, that’s the thing. So that’s where we designed the generation at this moment. We design everything with having one ahead in our mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hermen Hulst turned the talk away from hardware to what’s lined up in PlayStation’s portfolio, including new titles like Ghost of Yotei and live-action adaptations. He revealed that The Last of Us (HBO) was such a roaring success that it has been considered a ‘game changer’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We learned a lot from that.</p>



<p>At PlayStation productions, we have 10 productions now in the works: “The Last of Us,” “Twisted Metal,” a few others that we’re very excited about.</p>



<p>We’re talking about adaptations, but in adaptations, that’s taking the game and then see what else you can do with it. We’re actually looking to build from the ground up — as we tried to do originally with “Horizon,” in creating this world and creating this storyline — and how can you tell stories in this world on various mediums?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rounding out the interview with Variety, Hulst touched on a sore spot – the recent layoffs that hit PlayStation’s subsidiaries, including the shutdown of Concord and Firewalk Studios.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business. That’s part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it’s very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we’ve had some layoffs.</p>



<p>But it’s also important to realize that on the content side, PlayStation Studios is now a much bigger organization than when it started. It’s grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through M&amp;A. So the organization, the employment is much greater now than it was, let’s say, for example, five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want the full meat on the bones, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you can visit Variety</a> for the complete interview.</p>
