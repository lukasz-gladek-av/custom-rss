<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158177/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>This review was originally published in November 2009. We're updating and republishing it in honour of the game's arrival on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> as part of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-online-games-list-every-nintendo-classics-retro-game-on-nso-plus-expansion-pack#nintendo-switch-online-switch-2-gamecube-games-3">the Nintendo Classics GameCube lineup</a>.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Meet the Sandersons, your atypical, dysfunctional American family.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanderson is an out-of-work engineer-cum-manchild who lives on the lounge sofa playing with action figures and watching his favourite superhero program Space Ranger Drake Redcrest™ (apologies if that hits too close to the bone for some readers).</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanderson is trying to keep everything together in the wake of her husband's apparent disinterest in finding gainful employment and his habit of spending their meagre funds on toys.</p>
<p>And their daughter, Jenny, wears a frog costume and refuses to communicate in anything but frog language. She worries about her family's future now that Mom won't let Dad sleep in their bedroom, instead locking herself up at night to go over the family finances.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158174/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>In a move that infuriates Mrs. Sanderson, Mr. Sanderson brings home yet another new toy in the form of Chibi-Robo, a tiny robot whose mission in life is to become the number one Chibi-Robo in the world by giving happiness to the people in his new home. Thus is the stage set for one of the most charming and endearing games ever to grace a console as players assume the robotic role in order to restore harmony and happiness to the Sanderson home.</p>
<p>The game's sights and sounds are an immediate draw: the house is a bright and colourful mix of different eras, with a TV that looks vintage 1960s set amidst a timeless household decor filled with all manner of odd and lovable characters. The music is simple and light, punctuated by musical notes that play in time to Chibi-Robo's footsteps and change depending upon the surface he's walking on. The speech is an appealing musical gibberish that is commonplace nowadays, though the English subtitles are well-translated, conveying each character's own unique personality. Whilst this mid-2000s classic deals with serious issues like death and divorce, it doesn't get too heavy and being an active participant in the story's unfolding is one of the great joys of playing the game.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158173/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's a bit difficult to describe what kind of game Chibi-Robo! is. It's not really an action game, although Chibi-Robo can obtain a weapon (the Sonic Blaster) and destroy little enemy robots called Spydorz. It's not really an RPG, though he does gain larger battery capacity as he rises through the global Chibi-Robo rankings and you advance the story by talking with other characters. It's not really a platform game, either, though the game's setting in the Sanderson's family home does have ample platforms to traverse in Chibi's travels. Whatever the genre, it's definitely a fun game and that's what counts!</p>
<p>Chibi-Robo lives in a plugged-in house on the living room floor with his companion robo ("manager") Telly-Vision, who floats about giving advice and taking him home when the day is done, or if he fails to get to a plug in time and collapses on the floor with a spent battery. Initially, Chibi-Robo's out-and-about times last for 5 minutes, but this can be quickly upgraded to 10 or 15 minutes. You may also use Moolah to buy upgrades or other items. If you fight Spydorz and destroy them, you can pick up pieces of scrap metal for making Utility Bots that act as ladders or bridges in various rooms to reach high places.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158175/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Robo's activities alternate between day and night periods. During the day the Sandersons are active and can be chatted to, whereas toys are inert. Everybody loves Chibi: Mr. Sanderson bought you and he likes gadgets, so he just thinks you're the best (changing the TV channel to his favourite show gets you some bonus Happy Points, although given that his slovenly behaviour is a big cause of strife in the house, this might not be the best choice); Jenny likes drawing pictures of you and if you bring her frog rings found scattered about the house she'll bestow you with kisses; Mrs. Sanderson enjoys having tea and being able to discuss her problems with you (though she hasn't gotten your name right and insists upon calling you "Cheebo"); and their dog, Tao, just growls at you (it's a shame you can't speak dog - yet).</p>
<p>At night, the Sanderson house takes a darker turn and not just because the lights are out. Mr. Sanderson sleeps on the sofa with the dog and can be heard muttering "Sorry, dear" in his sleep. You'll find Jenny outside of her mother's bedroom with a sorrowful look on her face, while mother herself can be heard inside the bedroom telling everyone outside to be quiet and muttering about the finances.</p>
<p>The household toys all come to life at night and they all have their own dramas to entangle Chibi-Robo in and provide windows into how the Sandersons got where they are now. Of course, with drama and strife comes the opportunity to make people happy - whether that person is a Sanderson, a doll, an action figure, or one of those novelty musical dancing flowerpot things.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158169/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The active inhabitants of the Sanderson house may be different day or night, but one thing never changes: the house is a mess. Chibi-Robo! is a great way to work out your obsessive-compulsive disorder as the start of every active period reveals more rubbish to pick up and stains to clean off the floors and carpets. This ends up being rather satisfying and a good way to ensure a steady flow of Happy Points and Moolah for your coffers.</p>
<p>Whilst Mrs. Sanderson may have opposed your presence initially, your helping out around the house is greatly appreciated, so she gives you a bonus of both Happy Points and Moolah after a certain number of stains are cleaned or bits of rubbish collected. You never know when these bonuses are assigned, so it pays to never leave a pawprint unscrubbed or crumpled paper uncollected.</p>
<p>This game was absolutely made for anyone who enjoys exploring virtual worlds. Chibi-Robo is less than 10 centimetres tall (much like a certain diminutive plant-loving space traveller), so the Sandersons' modest two-bedroom home is a massive world to navigate. The genius of the game's design is shown by the many ways this world can be navigated, not all of which are immediately apparent. Part of the fun is simply looking around for objects of note and then figuring out how to reach them using stacks of books or shimmying up shoelaces, electrical cables or purse straps.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158170/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Chibi-Vision gives you a first-person view through the robot's eyes, highlighting special items and enabling full camera control beyond what's present in the normal third-person view. Items for Chibi-Robo's use in cleaning make themselves known immediately, but the function of other items won't be clear until a conversation or some other event takes place.</p>
<p>If there's a criticism to be made, it's that the automatic camera will sometimes allow objects to block your view of Chibi or have trouble changing perspective when navigating a corner of the room. Thankfully, manual control with the C-stick is available and does a good job of moving around obstacles, though the camera won't pass through walls, so sometimes it can only be moved in one direction. That this minor issue is the only serious complaint shows how well-crafted this game truly is.</p>
<p>Throughout, you get the sense that developer Skip really did its best to bring this world to life and let players have fun exploring it. Rather than using a mission structure or outright telling you what to do, you're given the tools and then enticed into moving the central story along by dropping hints that something interesting could happen if you go somewhere or take a certain action. At any given time you can have multiple avenues of exploration open, with different storylines happening, so if you run into a dead end with one, you can focus on another.</p>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158178/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The bite-sized gaming portions and ability to save anywhere you can plug in to recharge batteries also makes Chibi-Robo! well-suited if you don't have time for lengthy play sessions. Best of all, after the credits roll, the game doesn't stop; you can choose to continue and tie up loose ends or find more secrets.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chibi-Robo is an oddity: a game with a simple goal but a great deal of freedom in making the journey. It's a game about tiny altruistic robots helping humans with real problems, told in a light-hearted manner that will appeal to a wide audience. This is a game that really defines where Nintendo is coming from as a company: focusing on making people happy and doing good deeds; on helping people rather than shooting them in the face.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rue-valley-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/time-loop-rpg-rue-valley-set-for-november-release-date.1276887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Owlcat Games and developer Emotion Spark Studio have announced the release date for their time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, and it's hitting PC and consoles in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on November 11th. It'll serve as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/owlcat-publishing-rpgs" rel="nofollow">inaugural publishing project</a> for Owlcat; the studio is mainly known for developing CRPGs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pathfinder-wrath-of-righteous" rel="nofollow">Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>is one of two publishing projects currently in the works at Owlcat; the other,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, is a "turn-based RPG where feudal Japan meets magic and machine", although unfortunately, it doesn't have a release window yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=AU3lrV79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rue-valley-release-date-corkboard.jpg?itok=m1waU7zw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time loop RPG&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>arrives in November.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, it's a time loop RPG heavily inspired by&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/longdue-hopetown-kickstarter-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">far</a> from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">only game</a> for which that description feels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">appropriate</a>).</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>takes place during a time loop, you'll have the opportunity to shape the protagonist's personality as you see fit. You can, as Emotion Spark puts it, "be a cold-hearted loner who overthinks everything or a melodramatic loudmouth who always trusts their gut instinct".</p>

<p>As you play, you'll store your memories in a special graph, and you'll use those memories to inform your personality and skills. Just like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>de-emphasizes traditional combat in favor of a more psychological approach to the genre.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley</em>, which gives you a sense of what you're in for if you decide to pick it up in November, right here.</p>




<p>While Owlcat may be moving into publishing with&nbsp;<em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Road</em>, that doesn't mean the studio is abandoning development; it's currently hard at work on <i>Warhammer 40k: Dark Heresy</i>, another turn-based RPG set in the grim darkness of the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p><em>Rue Valley&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/rue_valley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rue-valley-48a101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Store</a>, as well as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014770/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/rue-valley/9pjmhlrct0j2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch, on November 11th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vampire-survivors-balatro-kill-the-brickman-poncle-roguelike-2000619132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-survivors-dev-publishes-surreal-roguelike-about-shooting-human-brick-heads-you-can-play-right-now.1276878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> takes the basic premise of the arcade classic Breakout and adapts it to a <em>Baltro</em>-style deckbuilder roguelike where you shoot custom bullets to break bricks, win cash, collect upgrades, and extend your run. So far, so neat. But no small part of <em>Kill the Brickman</em>‘s staying power is its surreal presentation that puts Blendo Games-looking faces on all the violence. The bricks you kill? Human. The bullets you shoot? Human. It all adds up to a punchy bite-sized arcade experience published by <em>Vampire Survivors</em> dev Poncle that’s just weird enough to keep me coming back.</p> <p>Revealed during the Microsoft Gamescom showcase on Thursday, <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is out August 21 on Xbox and PC. In keeping with its publishing partner’s tradition, the game is only $5. It’s made by Doonutsaur, a small U.S.-based team whose only other project on Steam is a similarly offbeat roguelike called <em>Meow Legion</em>. Poncle director&nbsp;Luca Galante apparently got an email about the game, immediately fell in love, and signed it just a few days later. “Imagine <em>Tetris</em>, but if the bricks had anger issues and a taste for human flesh,” reads the tag line in the press release.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="poncle presents | Kill the Brickman - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NHXV2qa9jE?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Kill the Brickman</em> has you control a revolver at the bottom of the screen that you load custom bullets into. Some do more damage. Some have more bounces. Others can deal corrosive damage, and so on. Think the original <em>Breakout</em>, or one of its many clones, but instead of bouncing a ball to break bricks like a spin-off of <em>Pong</em>, you’re playing a turn-based puzzle shooter infused with light <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> RPG elements.</p>

 <p>Why are you killing the Brickman? Well, if they get to close they will hurt you and deplete your health. Once all your hearts are gone the run is over. But like any good roguelike, skill and intuition will only get you so far. You try to complete mini-objectives in each level to score extra cash, which compounds interest just like in <em>Balatro</em>, to purchase the sorts of upgrades that will make or break your run later on. There are relics to collect that provide special bonuses, and different gun chambers that will augment bullet effects based on the pattern you reload them in.</p> <p>I’ve only played a couple hours (Poncle provided Kotaku with access to an advance copy), but it’s one of those games I’ve been trying to make 10-15 minutes for at the end of each day and end up playing way longer than I expected. <em>Kill the Brickman</em> is a tight set of gameplay concepts wrapped up in a cool CRT pixel art aesthetic and a bizarre sense of humor, or is it horror? I’m excited to keep playing and see where it goes.</p>

The publisher has issued a takedown notice to Nexus Mods to remove a pair of custom nude mods that left the game's lead female character, Isabella Torrisi, without anything to wear.</p><p>Nexus Mods <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13520836-takedown-request-issued-by-take-two-interactive-software-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the request from Take-Two</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/take-two-lawyers-give-mafia-nude-mods-the-cement-shoes-treatment-dmca-projects-that-had-the-dons-daughter-parading-in-the-buff/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), and complied by removing the Nude Isabella mod and the Extended Textures for Nude Isabella mod, both of which were created by a user known as <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/norskpl/mods" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">norskpl</a>. PC Gamer speculates norskpl may have used Isabella's model from her love scenes in the game. Norskpl's non-nude mods created for The Old Country appear to have been left intact. That includes a few mods that let players assume the role of other characters from the Mafia franchise.</p><p>In the context of the game, Isabella is the daughter of Don Torrisi, the boss of the player's character, Enzo Favara. Although the Don is fiercely protective of Isabella and has his own ideas about who she should marry, she and Enzo have a clandestine affair behind his back. That's the primary romantic relationship in the game, and the source of inevitable conflict.</p><p>Getting rid of the nude mods may keep them off of Nexus Mods, but there's always the possibility that someone can create new mods and post them somewhere else. This may only be a temporary solution for Take-Two, and it only brought the issue to the forefront.</p><p>The Old Country developer Hanger 13 recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-will-expand-with-free-ride-mode-in-future-update/1100-6533987/" data-ref-id="1100-6533987">a future update will introduce a Free Ride mode</a> that will let players escape from the linear narrative of the primary story and allow them to explore the countryside around them. The game already has a free-roam mode through the Chapter Replay menu, but the background characters and their surroundings aren't as compelling to see in that mode.</p><p>Mafia: The Old Country is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, 2K Games acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a shake-up at Cloud Chamber</a>--the studio behind BioShock 4--following reports that the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">failed an internal review</a>. Now, a new report suggests that the game could have come out as soon as next year if BioShock 4 had been more favorably received by the company.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, BioShock 4 was planned for a debut in either late 2026 or early 2027. However, the subsequent layoffs at Cloud Chamber will likely delay the next BioShock game even further. Bloomberg notes that 80 employees from Cloud Chamber were let go, leaving approximately 170 people remaining at the studio.</p><p>Studio head Kelley Gilmore was ousted from Cloud Chamber after the game's internal review, according to the report. In his place, 2K Games has hired Rod Fergusson to take over the studio following his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">departure from Blizzard</a>. In addition to leading the Diablo franchise for Blizzard, Fergusson previously worked on BioShock Infinite and helped get that game's production on track.</p><p>The initial reports about BioShock 4's status suggested that 2K Games was unsatisfied by the narrative. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">a memo shared with GameSpot</a> by 2K Games, president David Ismaile said, "While we're excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we've made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game."</p><p>For now, there's no word about the release window of BioShock 4. Francis Lawrence is slated to direct a live-action BioShock movie at Netflix, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Analogue 3D has been delayed once again, this time to the fourth quarter of 2025, although Analogue says it's almost over the finish line with the beleaguered console.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue3d-shipping-in-q4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on its official website, Analogue says the new Q4 2025 release window has been "intentionally set conservatively", presumably so that no further delays happen and consumers aren't disappointed again.</p>

<p>The company says that the Analogue 3D is currently "at 99%", and that the project's "hardware, system, [and] packaging" have all been "set for months". It's "the last 1%" on which Analogue is currently "focused", although the company stops short of explaining exactly what that 1% constitutes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=rgc8Xjt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-white.jpg?itok=FjGFjwCz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's going to take a little longer for you to get your Analogue 3D, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p>Analogue closes its statement by saying it's "pushing without pause and appreciate[s] everyone’s patience and trust", promising to "deliver — delays or not". It seems the company is still confident you're going to get your Analogue 3D, although we don't know exactly when yet.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the Analogue 3D has been delayed. The console, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">first revealed back in 2023</a>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">pushed back to 2025 in late 2024</a>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july" rel="nofollow">moved once again back in March</a>, with Analogue pledging to ship the machine by July, although that's obviously a goal the company was unable to meet.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what the Analogue 64 is, it's a retro "reimagining" of the Nintendo 64; it plays real N64 cartridges and apes the original aesthetic of Nintendo's console, although mercifully, the controller with which Analogue recommends you play is a little more ergonomic.</p>

<p>Rather than using emulation, the Analogue 3D uses FPGA, which the company says effectively eliminates "incompatibilities found in software emulation like input lag, graphic/audio inaccuracies, timing/frame rate issues and more".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-arty.jpg?itok=vIf7g2qJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-q4-2025-arty.jpg?itok=JdT8U9Bd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll get your Analogue 3D...eventually. Hopefully.</figcaption></figure><p>The Analogue 3D is now set to launch sometime in Q4 2025 (although, depending on how Analogue calculates quarters, this may mean early 2026). In the meantime, if you want to claim a refund on yours, you can <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/contact" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">do so here</a>.</p>

<p>The catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> was one of our favourite announcements out of the Switch 2 reveal Direct back in April. A lot of us missed the original remake when it arrived on beefier consoles back in 2020, and even those who did manage to get around to it were excited by the prospect of playing it on the go.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Square Enix have kept quiet on any further information about the game in the months since (come on, we want a release date!), so we were pleased to see it join the third-party lineup in Nintendo's Switch 2 booth at Gamescom this year. With its 40+ hour campaign, this has the potential to be a pretty hefty port, so would the new hardware be able to keep up?</p>
<p>Fortunately, the lovely Felix was on hand in Cologne to blast through a 15-minute FFVII preview and fill us in on what we can expect. In short, it's looking really rather good.</p>
<p>Mr. Felix was happy to report that the portion of the game he got to sample ran super smoothly, with a frame rate that he put somewhere between 30 and 60fps. The accompanying over-the-shoulder footage shows it in action, and we have to agree, that smoothness is a welcome sight (particularly after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">worrying stories</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>).</p>
<p>Of course, he only got the opportunity to see the early introduction in this preview, so there's no guarantee that things will be quite so strong as the game opens up, but it looks promising so far! You can check out Felix's thoughts in full in the above discussion with the wonderful Zion.</p>
<p>Now then, how about we go more specific on that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-scores-switch-2-release-window">'Winter' release window</a>, eh?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-fans-face-burnout-as-battlefield-6-hype-soars.1276806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week was a big one for Activision and all the studios that work on the popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-call-of-duty-games-from-worst-to-best-1844765026"><em>Call of Duty</em> franchise</a>. At Gamescom, devs took to the stage of Opening Night Live to show off our first real look at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, the new main entry in the franchise. But due to various reasons, including hype for EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em> and fans feeling burned out, the vibes are all off, and for the first time in years, it feels like the <em>Call of Duty</em> empire is shaking.</p> <p>Even before <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s big gameplay reveal at Gamescom, the upcoming shooter was being targeted online by fans and critics who loved the <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>. Players, myself included, praised <em>BF6</em>‘s gritty combat, boots-on-the-ground action, sharp visuals, squad gameplay, and snappy shooting. For many players online, it felt like a return to the realistic military sims that once dominated the industry back in the early to mid aughts. I’m talkin’ games like <em>Battlefield 3</em>, <em>Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter</em>, and<em> Rainbow Six Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><em>BF6′</em>s beta, its popularity, and the reaction to it led to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-is-going-to-boot-stomp-black-ops-7-because-call-of-duty-has-become-lazy/">former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra tweeting</a>: “<em>Battlefield</em> [6] will boot stomp <em>CoD</em> this year. But the real win here is <em>CoD</em> won’t be lazy anymore, and we’ll all get better FPS games for it.” It didn’t help that during the <em>BF6</em> beta, <a href="https://x.com/CallofDutyWire/status/1954624776921894980">a <em>Call of Dut</em>y rollercoaster gun went viral</a> for all the wrong reasons. And before that, players were upset over expensive crossover skins, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmvByyks-Fc">including<em> American Dad</em> and <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead c</em>osmetics</a>, that some felt were turning<em> Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone</em> into <em>Fortnite</em>, a game famous for its wild IP sandbox that features Goku, Batman, and more.</p>

 <p>This all led to Tuesday, when <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s first gameplay trailer premiered at Gamescom. It did so under a lot of scrutiny and in an atmosphere where even longtime vets of the series weren’t happy about the state of the game. So when the trailer showed off wild, trippy gameplay involving dream worlds and robots and strange sci-fi tech, it went over very, very poorly online. On Reddit, you can find fans saying they are done.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9txkGBj_trg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another indicator that this new <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal isn’t landing with fans is how poorly it has been received on YouTube. The comments below the trailer are filled with players claiming they are going to pre-order <em>BF6</em> instead and wondering what happened to <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1958183849877201177">As reported by <em>CharlieIntel</em></a>, the <em>Black Ops 7</em> reveal trailer has only around 36k likes. That makes it one of the least liked trailers in the franchise’s history.</p> <p>Things only got worse when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked Miles Leslie</a>, associate creative director on the game, if<em> Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;was going to feature silly crossover skins. Leslie claimed that the devs were “always looking at community feedback” and then proceeded to offer up a nothingburger answer about trying to “calibrate” future skins based on “feedback” and making sure “all fans feel represented.”&nbsp; This answer didn’t go over well with players, especially when <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/it-has-to-be-grounded-battlefield-6-devs-say-cosmetics-wont-be-as-goofy-as-call-of-duty-but-that-sounds-almost-too-good-to-be-true/">compared to the response given by <em>BF6</em>‘s design director Shashank Uchil</a> when asked a similar question about cosmetics.</p>

 <p>“It has to be grounded. That is what <em>BF3</em> and <em>BF4</em> was—it was all soldiers, on the ground,” said Uchil. “It’s going to be like this. I don’t think it needs&nbsp;Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p> <p>It would be foolish to count <em>Call of Duty</em> out in 2025. The franchise is still incredibly popular, especially with people who aren’t online every day, posting on Reddit and Discord. In 2024, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgg2djbq4c2n"><em>Black Ops 6</em> was still the best-selling premium video game of the year</a>, and the overall franchise sold more games last year than any other series. I would be shocked if <em>Battlefield 6</em> outsells<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> this holiday season. Still, it’s clear that the vibes are rotten with this year’s <em>Call of Duty.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It feels like fans are getting burned out on back-to-back direct sequels (something the franchise avoided for nearly 20 years), expensive cosmetics, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">AI-produced slop</a>, the series getting wackier and weirder, and a sense that the people making the games aren’t listening to the people playing the games. This isn’t entirely new. For as long as<em> Call of Duty</em> has been popular, people have been hating on it. But this year, grumpy fans and tired vets have<em> Battlefield 6</em> to rally around, an FPS that feels like it was designed in a lab to recreate the experience of playing those old Xbox 360-era military shooters people loved so much. In a way, it almost feels like <em>CoD</em> fans are hoping for <em>BF6</em> to punish<em> Black Ops 7</em>, and they seem willing to pay money to help kick Activision in the gut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TT Games is back with a bang with the upcoming release of LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, telling the story of decades of the Caped Crusader’s history, and multiplayer details have already been announced.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-revealed-at-gamescom-onl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revealed at Gamescom</a> with a 2026 release window, eyebrows have been raised following news that LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight seemingly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-will-feature-only-7-playable-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only has seven playable characters</a>, which would be a huge change given previous titles have featured hundreds of minifigures to choose from.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been a core feature in TT Games’ LEGO franchise for years, with no major changes to the format so far. Here, we’ve got all the details on whether that approach is being adjusted with the new LEGO Batman title.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-online-multiplayer">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Online Multiplayer?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Switch up. Image via TT Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not support online multiplayer or co-op, it has been confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>In an <a href="https://legogamessupport.wbgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/43979623023123-LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ post</a> about the game, it was announced that online co-op will not be available, continuing the trend from other LEGO titles from TT Games.</p>



<p>The most recent release, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, also did not feature online co-op. While there has been a desire from players for the feature to be added, it will not be available in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight.</p>



<p>It remains be seen whether any future LEGO games from TT Games change this trend, though it doesn’t seem likely currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-have-split-screen-co-op">Will LEGO Batman: Legacy of The Dark Knight Have Split-Screen Co-Op?</h2>



<p><strong>While LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight does not have online co-op support, two-player couch co-op has been confirmed as a feature.</strong></p>



<p>Couch co-op is a staple of TT Games’ LEGO titles, and, while couch co-op is becoming increasingly rarer in modern gaming, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight will not be removing the feature.</p>



<p>Only two players are supported at a single time, however, which makes sense given that a fair amount of screen space is required to truly enjoy the LEGO experience.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the next couch co-op title to play with a friend, partner, or other relative, LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight could tick the boxes.</p>



<p>What do you want to see featured in LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight? Let us know in the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <p>
John Carpenter's Halloween is the latest horror movie classic to get the multiplayer treatment, and it's coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026.
</p>
<p>
Halloween is being developed by Illfonic, the studio behind the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game, and Predator Hunting Grounds. And like those movie adaptations, Halloween is also being designed as a "one-versus-many" asymmetrical horror affair as the iconic Michael Myers pursues the residents of Haddonfield.
</p>
<p>
"In dynamic and ever-changing 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer matches, hero players must arm themselves with everyday household items, weapons, and knowledge to combat an unpredictable and unkillable enemy," Illfonic explains. "Convincing townsfolk and contacting the police will lead to increasingly powerful and thorough neighbourhood patrols. To even the odds, you can command and equip NPCs with weapons to outsmart or even overpower The Shape, providing precious windows for escape."

<p>
Illfonic reckons its take on Halloween "masterfully recreates" the ambience of the original 1978 movie, with talk of multiple maps set across "authentic" Haddonfield locations, and a soundtrack inspired by John Carpenter's classic score. Notably too, its familiar asymmetrical multiplayer mode will be accompanied by an offline single-player story mode featuring bots.
</p>
<p>
There's no word of a release date for Halloween beyond its "2026" arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, but there's a mood-setting trailer above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Excitement levels continue to rise for Hollow Knight: Silksong ahead of release, and a flood of new gameplay from a demo has made its way online, leading to the question of whether it can be downloaded.</p>



<p>In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">hands-on preview</a>, we made it clear that the hype for Hollow Knight: Silksong is well placed, and the assessment from others who have gotten a chance to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play at Gamescom</a> is similar. Now, though, players around the world want their own chance to play.</p>



<p>The guide below details everything we know about the Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, including whether you can add it to your library to try out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-available-to-download">Is The Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo Available to Download?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth the wait. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is not currently a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo available to download, and all gameplay footage currently emerging is from Gamescom.</strong></p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is playable on both Xbox and Nintendo Switch platforms at Gamescom in Cologne, but it is exclusively available at the event for the time being. Therefore, it cannot be downloaded.</p>



<p>The demo is also the same stage of the game that was first playable at E3 2019 six years ago, which, though it may be surprising, could mean it takes place very early in the game.</p>



<p>Fans around the world will need to wait at least a little while longer to get a taste of the game, as currently the only details we know about the playable demo is it’s availability at Gamescom. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-demo">Will There Be A Hollow Knight: Silksong Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>No announcements have been made regarding a Hollow Knight: Silksong demo, but there could be one provided before launch.</strong></p>



<p>A big Hollow Knight: Silksong announcement is coming today via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XGeJwsUP9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, which could reveal the release date or details about a demo, early access, or other details.</p>



<p>If there is a demo, expect it to be available across all platforms, though given the hype for the game, it could release without one. </p>



<p>For now, though, there isn’t a way to play Hollow Knight: Silksong early, but keep an eye on Insider Gaming for more coverage and news as it breaks.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has received its official ESRB rating, sparking hope that release date news is on the way soon.</p>
<p>Now updated on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoq0XKl9zufnvocUdO1Qzyc9ZClShISZIsMBBfKAd94rNIsaJFY2">US eShop</a>, Metroid Prime 4 has received a Teen rating, with animated blood and violence. In the UK, it has a provisional PEGI 12. These ratings are the same as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>.</p>

Oi oi, where my Janeway fans at? Where my Parisians and my Torresians? Can I get a whoop, whoop for Chakotay? A high five for Seven of Nine? Daedalic have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, a "story-based survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game" adaptation of the loneliest of the classic Treks. Created by developers gameXcite, who I may yet forgive for capitalising their name that way, it asks you to "manage systems and crew, engage in diplomacy, navigate difficult moral decisions, and face the unknown". It's got a cutaway dollhouse spaceship and a HUD made up to resemble a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a> bridge display. Also, Ensign Harry Kim is here! He wants orders. Kim, your orders are to roll that trailer.

<p>
Here's some blurb from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">the Steam page</a>: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Set aboard the U.S.S. Voyager and deep in the unexplored reaches of the Delta Quadrant, Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown invites players to relive--and redefine--the legendary starship's journey back to earth. The game blends exploration, ship &amp; resource management, roguelite elements, and meaningful choices. Experience crew dynamics and a fresh take on a beloved sci-fi universe -- with what-if scenarios that open up new possibilities. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If you're like me, you are presently being torn in half by the contrast between your apathy for yet another set of "roguelike elements", and your enthusiasm for the what-if scenarios. Maybe an episode where Janeway becomes the Borg Queen? Maybe the Doctor gets to be captain? Maybe Neelix undergoes some kind of Garrus-style reinvention as a badass with hairy ears? All that may have actually happened, I can't remember. Some more from the Steam page: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don't react accordingly. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There's a base-building component: you'll add facilities to the Voyager's innards as you go, in the manner popularised by XCOM: Enemy Unknown. I'm less sold on the tiddly, top-down spaceship movement within solar systems, which recalls <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> at its dinkiest and makes the Delta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quadrant">Quadrant</a> seem as strange and enveloping as Center Parcs. But I do like the sound of the away missions, in which you get to handpick a team of named faces and redshirts.</p><p>"A team with skills that complement each other might be best suited for the task, but it is up to you to call the shots," the developers comment. "Minimize the risk for the team's members, rush headlong into danger, or take a scientific approach - you decide." All this and, of course, ship-to-ship combat, in which you'll assign crews to stations and target individual systems.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date. In case it wasn't obvious already, my excitement about this game is at least 80% nostalgia spike, with another 5% consisting of furtive teenage memories of certain saucy fan fiction websites. Finally, we can make Paris and Chakotay bone. The developers don't have much form for space sims: going by their website, they have hitherto specialised exclusively in Asterix comic adaptations. I guess a starship is a kind of Gallic village? Let's finish off by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMHx7fiLEow">watching the original Voyager intro</a> again.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WarGaming’s World of Tanks: HEAT might have turned a few heads when it was first announced during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, but after getting hands-on with the game in a behind-the-scenes opportunity, I’m pleased to say it’s awesome!</p>



<p>For full disclosure and context, I have played a few hundred hours of World of Tanks and World of Tanks: Blitz, so I am pretty familiar with WarGaming titles and the mechanics behind tank combat in their games (important for later). Unfortunately, my hands-on opportunity was limited to around 15 minutes against AI bots, which, for a multiplayer title, is never great. Still, I managed to gain a good understanding of where the developers want to take HEAT and why they picked this particular direction.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-meets-tanks">Call of Duty Meets Tanks</h2>



<p>I don’t think anyone was crazily surprised to see yet another free-to-play multiplayer shooter announced during Gamescom, but WarGaming’s World of War: HEAT has something fairly unique going for it – Tanks. Sticking with the World of Tanks has been criticised by the community that has been testing the game under the codename Project Cold War, but honestly, after getting hands-on with the game, it makes sense. While I understand that the World of Tanks brand is catered to a specific audience that prefers accuracy, HEAT offers the brand a chance to tap into a wider and more accessible audience.</p>



<p>The only way I can logically describe HEAT is that it’s similar to Call of Duty in terms of accessibility and gameplay loop. If you view the Tanks as Weapons (which I suppose they are), things make a lot more sense. In HEAT, your Tank can be fully customized just like a weapon in Call of Duty with paint jobs, charms, and even a 100-point system for different upgrades (similar to Battlefield 6’s 100-point system for firearms). </p>



<p>The Call of Duty similarities don’t end there, either, with HEAT offering players various game modes, including Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>However, one layer of complexity that’s still maintained in the game from the classic World of Tanks title is that players still have to learn Tanks’ weak spots and vulnerabilities in their armor. However, to make the game more accessible to players, the crosshairs are similar to those in World of Tanks Arcade mode, where they indicate the armor’s penetration points, but this time in a handy x-ray-like vision.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-a-hero-shooter">A Hero Shooter?</h2>



<p>The game’s setting in an alternative WW2 universe gives the developers the chance to be a little bit more creative with the tanks and their accessories, allowing for some tanks to have Gatling guns, missiles, and so on attached to the vehicle. </p>



<p>In HEAT, the ‘heroes’ are the Tank drivers, who, at launch, only have two tanks assigned to them. The developers tell me that on launch, each character will have an initial tank unlocked, with the second tank being unlocked through progression, or, of course, paid premium features to make the progression faster. They also tell me that this is just for the initial launch of the game, and that more tanks per character will come at a later date.</p>



<p>Other additions to tanks outside of the customization options are a boosting feature, which allows you to get from point A to point B quickly, or flank around enemies to hit their weak spots. At one point, I needed to unleash my inner ‘Fury’ and boost around an enemy and hit the tanks weapon spot from behind.</p>



<p>Just like in other hero shooters, Tanks also have abilities, which charge up over time, allowing for some hectic moments with weapons, shields, and more, which can change the course of a match in a matter of moments.</p>



<h2 id="h-genuinely-great">Genuinely Great</h2>



<p>It isn’t often that I walk away from a game demo, especially at a convention where you’re tired and playing on an unfamiliar setup, but overall, I think that WarGaming does have something special on their hands with HEAT.</p>



<p>The potential to grow the game beyond what I played with other progression options, expansions, and even Esports, which the developers say they currently don’t have planned, but is something they will do if there’s a demand, is exciting.</p>



<p>As for the release date, the developers tell me that while an exact release date isn’t planned, they are aiming to release World of War Tanks: HEAT in 2026 on the PC (and Steam Deck!), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. I did ask about Nintendo Switch 2, but currently, they are focused only on these platforms and will reevaluate when the game launches.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to World of Tanks: HEAT?</p>

<figure><a title="Gulikit - TT PRO and MAX" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/17baa59efc7bb/gulikit-tt-pro-and-max.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gulikit has unveiled two new premium controllers at its booth in Gamescom, both of which will be fully compatible with the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Dubbed the <strong>TT PRO</strong> and <strong>TT MAX</strong>, the design is kind of a cross between the Xbox and PlayStation, utilising the former's overall shape, yet shifting the left analogue stick to the bottom for a more symmetrical design. The controller was originally showcased last year as the 'Libra MAX', but Gulikit has since been hard at work finalising the design and specs.</p>
<p>Both models utilise Gulikit's brand new 720° tension-adjustable TMR analogue sticks with adjustable star-ring RGB lighting, rumble motors with a total of nine adjustable levels of vibration, 'Smart Trigger' technology to let players toggle between mouse-like micro-switch triggers and pressure sensitive analogue Hall Effect triggers, and of course, gyro aiming.</p>
<p>You've also got two different types of 'floating' d-pad designs (though we're not <em>completely</em> sold on the satellite dish-inspired design), four swappable rear paddles, and an extra ABXY key-cap kit in case you want to swap between Switch and PC layouts.</p>
<p>As for the differences between the two models, the TT MAX offers up an extra stick cap kit to customise your analogue sticks between three different height options, the ability to toggle between 8-directional and 4-direction d-pad functionalities, and motion-sense technology for PC gaming.</p>
<p>Gulikit is aiming to release both controllers in <strong>October 2025</strong>, with the PRO priced at <strong>$49.99</strong> and the MAX at <strong>$69.99</strong>. As with the company's recent releases, both models will be able to wake the Switch 2 from Sleep Mode - bosh.</p>

You really have to hand it to the publishers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>. They are the absolute masters of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, the doyens of stepping on rakes, even as they near the checkered flag. The long-awaited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> got a new trailer and what may actually prove to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">the final release date</a> at Gamescom Opening Night Live this week. The trailer was a feisty show of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>-esque mayhem, and the hands-on verdicts I've read (save for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-action-than-rpg-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-struggles-to-convince-after-a-few-hours-play">stinky uncle Eurogamer</a>) have been positive. Ours is forthcoming.
</p>
<p>
But then came the revelation that this much-delayed sequel to a quintessentially faction-led RPG from a company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">famous for downloadable add-ons</a> would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">sell two of its vampire clans as day-one DLC</a>. How we laughed! How we clutched our faces and chittered like gerbils! How we ran outside, begging for the moon to fall on our heads! Despair springs anew.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Our reporter on the ground at Gamescom is hardware editor James 'Hardwearing' Archer. He caught up with current and hopefully, final Bloodlines 2 developers The Chinese Room in person yesterday and, much like a parent coaxing a child away from a poisonous snake, casually asked them 'What's the thinking behind splitting off two of the clans as DLC?' 
</p>
<p>
The answer, broadly, is that the new clans represent additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game - sometimes at Paradox's request - so it's fair to flog those bits separately. As for releasing the DLC alongside the main game, which naturally suggests that it could be sold as part of the main game, a PR told James, not in so many words, that they don't want players to have to wait.
</p><p>
Narrative director Ian Thomas attempted to spell it all out. "It's worthwhile saying that the game - well, I've only been on the game, I think, for two and a half years - but during that period, we've had huge cycles of 'What are the player base thinking? What are they asking for? How does that fit in? What does the early alpha testing say, and what are they actually asking for?'" he said. (Side note to any more prosperous game developers reading: I feel like you are all taught by media training people to stall for time with rhetorical questions. Please stop doing this, it's very exasperating and only makes me suspicious.)
</p>
<p>
"So we've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like," Thomas continued. "Including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it."
</p>
<p>
According to Thomas, The Chinese Room are still "adding additional content even over the last few weeks". The extra clan material and associated story bits fall into this rubric of post-concept 'fattening'. So do certain character customisation features like hairstyles, piercings and tattoos, according to project design director Jey Hicks. "It's not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in," he said. "It's all got that same quality there." 
</p>
<p>
The original Bloodlines shipped with seven vampire clans, including one of the clans Bloodlines 2 wants to paywall. They appear to be very different games, however - Paradox have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">describing the sequel as a "spiritual successor"</a> - as one might expect from the fact that The Chinese Room have sod-all experience making CRPGs. I think it would be fair to argue that Bloodlines 2 only having four clans by default simply reflects a necessary change of direction, however much fans of the original might dislike that change of direction. It's also worth noting that the conditions of game development have changed enormously since 2004, and that given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">the turmoil of Bloodlines 2's overall development under Paradox</a>, it's miraculous they have anything to show at all.</p><p>But that's not the case the developers made to us at Gamescom. And in particular, none of the above really explains the decision to ship features returning players would reasonably expect to form part of the base package as day-one 'extras'. The "additional work" argument would ring truer if the DLC clans landed after release; as it is, the designation as to what constitutes the original concept and what constitutes an 'extra' seems totally arbitrary. The language about not wanting fans to wait just feels like predictable camouflage for the boring truth that they'd like to make more money.

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to grow bigger and better, and Season 4 is now rapidly approaching. We’ve got all the details on when it’s expected to drop and what could feature.</p>



<p>Following the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-5-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3.5</a>, which introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-blade-guide-release-date-stats-abilities-team-up-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blade as a playable character</a>, the game has been transitioning toward Season 4, which takes place after the defeat of Knull and Hela, who became the Queen in Black.</p>



<p>If you’re anxiously awaiting the drop of the new season, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-date-amp-time">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New battles. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although yet to be officially confirmed, Season 4 in Marvel Rivals is expected to begin on September 12, with several hints suggesting this is the case.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, that would mark the four-week point since the start of Season 3.5, which is the Marvel Rivals schedule for new season drops, and the <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250819/41548_1254783.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ancient Powers Awaken event</a> is due to end on September 12.</p>



<p>The end date for the event should line up perfectly with the start of the new season, though the rewards will be available to earn permanently if you purchase the Premium Pass. The end time has been confirmed to be <strong>September 12th at 2am PT.</strong></p>



<p>In the table below, we’ve detailed what time the release will be in your timezone. However, remember that end of season patches come alongside downtime, so you’ll need to wait a little while longer for servers to open.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Marvel Rivals Season 4 Release Date &amp; Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">02:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">04:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">05:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">09:00, September 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00, September 12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-marvel-rivals-season-4">What’s Coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4?</h2>



<p><strong>Full details of exactly what is coming in Marvel Rivals Season 4 are yet to be shared, but we know it will feature a new character, new maps, and a new Season Pass.</strong></p>



<p>Following several leaks at launch, we know a long list of characters that have been found in datamines, but developers are keeping their cards close to their chests. However, there have been some teases during Season 3.5 on what may be coming.</p>



<p>In the game’s lore, Hela was defeated by Blade with Dracula’s sword and escaped to a mysterious Eighth City, expected to be the ancient city of K’un-Lun, and met a shadowy figure by the name of Dizang. Artwork for the character, who has glowing eyes and horns, has led many to speculate that one of the new heroes will be Daredevil.</p>



<p>The lore text also mentions that Hela is likely to be pursued by “one of her kin” for her actions and, with Loki and Thor already in the game, that could open the door to Angela.</p>



<p>If the pair are to feature, it could be Angela that appears first, as Dizang has previously been a possessed version of Daredevil who leads The Hand, and he could therefore take the role as Season 4’s main antagonist, before being rescued and restored to a normal state for the second half of the season.</p>



<p>This is all merely speculation at this stage, however, but it won’t be too much longer until we have an official reveal.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is getting a new DLC update as well as its next story chapter on the 10th September.</p>
<p>The story update, which will be free, has you investigate a series of murders. It follows on directly from the main story of the base game, and will take you beneath Arrakeen where all manner of secrets await you.</p>
<p>As for the DLC, it'll cost $12.99 and is dubbed the "Lost Harvest" DLC. In it, you'll be called to a mysterious crashed ship out in the desert, and be able to build a new ground vehicle: The Treadwheel. This offers "no material benefit" over base vehicles in the game according to the Dune: Awakening DLC blog post, and can be traded with other players without the DLC.</p>

            <p>JRPG Lost Hellden has received a fresh gameplay trailer to show off its "Deep 2D" painted art style and action battle system.</p>
