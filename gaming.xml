In theory, nothing would stop players from creating a third-party marketplace on a subreddit or Discord server where people who have tons of duplicates sell them to the highest bidders. </p><p>That’s possibly one reason why the development team is restricting <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s trading feature to one-star cards and below. The rarest cards, like specific gold variants <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-poke-gold-price-1851744809">with only a .053 percent chance of dropping</a></span>, will remain locked to players accounts. They would still be able to sell entire accounts to one another, but that would sort of defeat the whole purpose of playing the game and collecting cards in the first place.</p><p>Of course, all of this is violates <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s rules, but that’s never been enough to completely stamp out cheating and other illicit practices in other economy-driven live-service games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. The proof will be in how many players <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> potentially ends up banning for this sort of thing, and if it publicizes those numbers as has become common across lots of other online games. </p><p>The <em>Pokémon Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>-inspired set Space-Time Smackdown arrives this week, alongside the new trading feature, but those cards will also be excluded from trades at launch. Creatures Inc. and DeNA have said exchanging cards with friends will only be available for existing the Genetic Apex and Mythical Island sets at the moment.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-satchels-for-a-sheet-metal-door-in-rust/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of life’s little joys is learning<strong> how many satchels for a sheet metal door</strong> in Rust. It’s a memorable moment, your first-ever raid against your neighbor, and likely to stick with you. In the early game, you likely won’t craft a metric ton of explosive ammo, and C4 is still a few workbenches away, but a satchel is easily accessible and open to most skill levels. Here’s how many it takes to get through your neighbor’s front door!</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>Assuming your raid target upgraded to a sheet metal door, which most Rust players should do immediately after building a base of any size, it will take a few satchels to blow through. In total, you need four satchels for a sheet metal door in Rust. That’s not many, and crafting satchels is not overly expensive. But hey, that’s just door number one!</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Door Type</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Satchels</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wooden Door</td><td data-align="center">2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sheet Metal Door</td><td data-align="center">4</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Garage Door</td><td data-align="center">9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Armored Door</td><td data-align="center">12</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>A sheet metal door has 250 health points and is more damage-resistant. A single satchel will deal approximately 61 HP damage to the door. As such, it requires a minimum of four satchels, with 6 HP leftover on the door after the fourth explosion, so you could waste a fifth satchel or use explosive ammo to blast the last few HP. Basically, hit it with anything else. Don’t waste a fifth satchel!</p>



<p>If you’re playing in a group, which Rust genuinely promotes, try to farm for C4. It’s a much better tool for raiding in Rust.</p>

              <section>

                <p>There was a point in time when it would have been unthinkable for Xbox-exclusive titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo or Gears of War to ever make the leap to PlayStation 5</a>. But the recent cross-platform push by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer may make those rumors into a reality. Now, Thomas Mahler--the creative director of Moon Studios and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review/1900-6416053/" data-ref-id="1900-6416053">Ori and the Blind Forest</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-review/1900-6417425/" data-ref-id="1900-6417425">Ori and the Will of the Wisps</a>--has endorsed Spencer's approach and suggested that it may be what's best for the video game industry.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883273827284599091" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy post on X</a>, Mahler argued that it no longer makes sense for Xbox and PlayStation consoles to compete when the hardware is so similar and the user base is "stuck attracting the same 100-150 [million] players for over two decades now." He argues that the key to growth is to make it easier for players to get their desired games regardless of which console they buy... with the exception of Nintendo, which doesn't have to play by anyone else's rules. Mahler added that "rooting for one huge corporation to sell more boxes over another strikes me as fantastically senseless... We should all just share in the love for games!"</p><p>For now, Spencer's platform agnostic position has not been adopted by Sony, but Mahler suggested that the PlayStation maker has already bent towards that reality by bringing its exclusive titles to PC, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-ps5-exclusive-hits-pc-in-march/1100-6529029/" data-ref-id="1100-6529029">recently announced Rise of the Ronin port</a>.</p><p>"We'll see how long Sony will keep limiting their software sales to one platform," <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/1883284453251813472" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote Mahler</a>. "There's a reason why they’re already releasing some games on PC now. It's money. They can probably ignore Xbox for now, since Xbox Series hasn't sold all that well, but that might change if Xbox makes a great console again. If they end up with a better machine than whatever the next PlayStation is and if players adopt that, Sony's platform-exclusive strategy is history."</p><p>Some of the most prominent cross-platform titles that are confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 from Xbox-affiliated studios include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-be-the-end-of-the-series/1100-6529013/" data-ref-id="1100-6529013">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. Microsoft also owns Activision, which released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's best-selling game</a> across all consoles in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. The upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-next-console-will-drive-major-industry-growth-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6528534/" data-ref-id="1100-6528534">launch of Nintendo's Switch 2</a> may also help the industry grow this year, and Spencer has already pledged that Microsoft will support the new console as well.</p>

			<p>It was announced that the first batch of third-party games will be arriving on the Epic Games Store on mobile. So far, there are nearly 20 third-party games available on the client, with games like Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe now on Android worldwide and i<a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">OS in the European Union</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside the third-party games being added to the mobile version of the store, they have also announced the free games program on mobile, allowing those who want the opportunity to redeem their free game in the store and keep it forever. At the moment, Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee is available to obtain on Android and iOS through the Epic Games Store mobile app until February 20. Bloons TD 6 will also be added to the program. As they get underway, there will be new games offered each month, and they will eventually move to a weekly schedule later on in the year.</p>
<p>The catalog of third-party titles consists of games such as Evoland 2 and Blade of God X: Orisols, with games like Eastern Exorcist and Mr Rider coming in the near future.</p>
<p>While the new third-party games are the main focus of the announcement from Epic, they've also added some new app features for iOS and Android. This includes Epic Account login, with a persistent status across Epic's games on iOS and Android. For those who want to, they've also added a new auto-update feature, meaning you can jump into your games without having to wait for them to update.</p>
<p>Additionally, they've made some announcements for the developers out there who are considering using the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store to publish their titles</a>. Epic has confirmed that the terms they carry for the PC version of their app carry over to mobile, including the 88/12 revenue share for payments and 0% on third-party payments.</p>
<p>The Launch Everywhere with Epic program was recently released, where it offers a royalty rate reduction from 5% to 3.5% on all platforms and stores for eligible Unreal Engine games that are published on the Epic Games Store from 2025 onwards. In order to be eligible for this, the games must ship on the Epic Store before or at the same time it's released on other stores. By doing this, it's helping the developers maximize their profits from releasing the game and having its initial run in the Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>Will you be playing any of the third-party titles on mobile with Epic Games Store? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>
Assassin's Creed publishers Ubisoft are making another round of layoffs as part of wider efforts to persuade their investors to stop yelling at them. They're letting 185 people go across their European operations, and will be closing UK-based Ubisoft Leamington, whose recent projects include supporting development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull And Bones</a>. All this less than two months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">jettisoning</a> the hundreds of people who worked on free-to-play shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">XDefiant</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 "As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritize projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft Düsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site," reads a statement sent to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-confirms-185-layoffs-as-it-closes-former-dj-hero-studio-and-downsizes-others/">VGC</a>. "Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft are currently in rather dire straits. Their share price fell precipitously last year, thanks in part to mixed reactions to Star Wars Outlaws. Earlier this month, their executive board <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-march-as-ubisofts-board-consider-a-company-sale">announced</a> that they were not only delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to boost its chances, but "[appointing] leading advisors to review and pursue various transformational strategic and capitalistic options to extract the best value for stakeholders". In short, they might be about to sell the company off.
</p>
<p>
It's claimed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">Bloomberg</a> that the company's founding Guillemot brothers and Chinese publishers Tencent - both minority stakeholders - are trying to found a new venture of some kind made up of Ubisoft corporate assets.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Leamington used to be FreeStyleGames, founded in 2002 by former Rare and Codemasters developers. They made break-dancing sim B-Boy for the PSP. Activision bought them in 2008 and put them to work on various music games, including the well-regarded DJ Hero in 2009 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guitar-hero">Guitar Hero</a> Live in 2015. Amid declining interest in peripheral-based rhythm games, Activision cut FreeStyle back and eventually sold them to Ubisoft in 2017. Since then, they've worked alongside Newcastle-based Ubisoft Reflections as a support studio.
</p><p>
Other Ubisoft developers have been paying tribute to the team on social media, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2">Tom Clancy's The Division 2</a> narrative director Lauren Stone. "If you liked the Classified Assignments, the Leamington Spa team led that feature," she <a href="https://x.com/laurenistone/status/1883914722195694027">wrote</a>. "It was a pleasure to work with them, and I consider this a huge loss. They were some of my favorite collaborators. I hope they find safe harbors soon to set anchor."
</p>
<p>
Best of luck to everybody affected by all this, in Leamington, Newcastle, Düsseldorf, Stockholm and elsewhere.

<p>Into The Breach, a United Kingdom-based esports organization, is winding down its operations due to its CEO’s embezzling of funds, leaving the organization in an “unsustainable” position. According to one of the organization’s CS2 players, the CEO “scammed” players out of thousands.</p>



<hr>



<p>Per an <a href="https://x.com/ITBesports/status/1883909874561831187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> from the organization, an investigation into the company began after “recent events…highlighted significant mismanagement.” ITB discovered that “an individual entrusted with all financial and monetary decisions was embezzling funds.”</p>



<p>On X, ITB CS2 player Owen “smooya” Butterfield <a href="https://x.com/smooyacs/status/1883910676902769137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed</a> the finger at CEO Sam “STM” Macedonio, claiming he was the one laundering money and scamming $500,000 from his own players. In his own post on X, Macedonio <a href="https://x.com/SlayTheMinotaur/status/1883911595975233999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted fault</a>, owing the decisions he made to a “destructive, alcoholic narcissist” side of him “hellbent on self-immolation.” Macedonio noted there will be “several legal consequences” that he will accept and face.</p>



<p>In the replies of his post, Macedonio said that Into The Breach made around £5.5 million between 2023 and 2024. He said that he took around £600,000 in “director’s loans,” which he claims he blew on “benders and self-harm action.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In his post, Macedonio made mention of the breakout moment for Into The Breach, when the relatively unknown organization surprised the Counter-Strike world with a playoff run at the BLAST Paris Major in 2023. The success brought on by that run prompted the organization to return to Dota 2 and Rainbow Six, and also enter competitive Halo for the first time.</p>



<p>Both Into The Breach and Macedonio have said that any available funds will be given to players who have lost money. All players across the various ITB esports divisions will now become free agents.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo Games is finally delivering a PC port for the popular open-world action RPG Rise of the Ronin on March 11, 2025. This guide will take you through the minimum and recommended system requirements for Rise of the Ronin.</p>



<p>Rise of the Ronin was released for PS5 in 2024, where players got to experience this open-world action RPG for the first time. The game is set in Japan’s Edo period, where you shape your destiny by interacting with actual historical figures and learning their ideologies. The game’s highlight was its gameplay, with players instantly falling in love with the plethora of combat styles available for the title’s various weapons. Additionally, the world created by Team Ninja is nothing short of beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-ronin-pc-system-requirements">Rise of the Ronin PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>To experience Rise of the Ronin on PC in all its beauty, the developers have provided a set of minimum and recommended system requirements. However, players will need 16 GB of RAM, 180 GB of SSD Storage Space and a broadband internet connection to run the game on either set of requirements. Additional notes state that “poor SSD performance may affect gameplay”, and multi-channel memory architecture is recommended. </p>



<p>Check out Rise of the Ronin PC’s minimum and recommended specifications per the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam listing</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum">Minimum</h3>



<p>The minimum requirements are not very demanding. Players only need an Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 1600 CPU and NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) GPU. This minimum set of requirements will allow Rise of the Ronin to run at 1080p/30FPS.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Specifications</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Minimum</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">Intel Core i5-10400 or better, AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 (VRAM 6GB) or better, AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (VRAM 8GB) or better</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB of RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">180 GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Audio</td><td data-align="center">16-bit stereo with 48KHz playback</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">OS</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10/11 64bit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX Version</td><td data-align="center">DirectX 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Network</td><td data-align="center">Broadband Internet Connection </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-recommended">Recommended </h3>



<p>Rise of the Ronin PC’s recommended system requirements allows players to experience the game at 1080p/60FPS under the standard graphics settings (upscaled). The recommended CPU and GPU specifications aren’t very high either, with the player needing an Intel Core i5-10600K/AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Super (VRAM 8GB)/AMD Radeon RX 6700XT (VRAM 12GB), respectively. The recommended requirements will allow players to experience Rise of the Ronin as the developers intended. </p>

                <p>A new trailer for the next EA Originals game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, has gone live and shows off more of the Hazelight-developed game in action. Narrated by game director Josef Fares, the gameplay trailer shows off two levels--one set in a sci-fi world, the other in a fantasy land--and how players will use unique co-op gameplay elements in each one to progress. For the sci-fi level, there are anti-gravity sections and bike chases to look forward to, while the fantasy level features shape-shifting gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlySOphMuo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big feature shown off in the Split Fiction video are Side Stories, optional one-off adventures that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Discovering one and exploring it will transport players to even more worlds influenced by sci-fi and fantasy fiction, with some of the levels including outer space, an Alice in Wonderland-themed world, and a stage that looks heavily influenced by the recent Dune movies.</p><p>Developed by the studio behind the critically acclaimed It Takes Two, Split Fiction was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-only-split-fiction-is-an-impressive-leap-forward-from-the-makers-of-it-takes-two/1100-6528426/">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a>. A mandatory two-player game, Split Fiction lets you play as two would-be writers: Mio and Zoe. After the pair sign up to participate in a new publishing program, they find themselves transported to virtual recreations of their stories by a shady tech company and have to work together to escape before they lose their memories.</p><p>Split Fiction is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on March 6, 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorders-for-it-takes-two-developers-new-game-split-fiction-now-live/1100-6528489/">and preorders are now live for it</a>. The great thing about the game is that it comes with a cross-play Friend Pass, allowing one user to invite a friend to join them even if they haven't purchased Split Fiction.</p><p>Thanks to its cross-play design, it also doesn't matter which of the three applicable platforms your pal is on either, as you'll both be able to team up for a jaunt across futuristic and magical lands. 2025 has quite a few exciting co-op games on the horizon, and if you're interested in seeing what else is coming out in this genre throughout the year, you can check out GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-most-anticipated-co-op-games-of-2025-and-beyond/2900-6144/" data-ref-id="2900-6144">most-anticipated co-op games of the year</a>.</p>

                <p>Sega recently filed trademarks for Skies of Arcadia and Eternal Arcadia, leaving fans hopeful that some sort of remaster or new entry in the Skies of Arcadia RPG series.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sega-trademarks-skies-of-arcadia-eternal-arcadia-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the two trademarks were filed on January 16 and made public on January 24. Skies of Arcadia, known as Eternal Arcadia in Japan, was a critically acclaimed RPG from Sega that launched in 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was later ported over to the Nintendo GameCube in 2002 as Skies of Arcadia Legends.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skies-of-arcadia/" data-ref-id="5000-891">Skies of Arcadia</a> follows Vyse, Aika, and Fina, who are part of a group of air pirates called the Blue Rogues as they resist against the tyrannical Valuan Empire. Additional ports of Skies of Arcadia have been highly requested by fans throughout the years, although Skies of Arcadia Legends has never been released outside of the GameCube.</p><p>Sega has not confirmed anything new regarding Skies of Arcadia. However, Sega has been on an initiative to revive some of its old franchises. Back in 2023, Sega <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">announced new entries</a> in the Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage franchises.</p><p>Sega is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-virtua-fighter-gets-unexpected-first-look-but-its-not-gameplay/1100-6528672/" data-ref-id="1100-6528672">new Virtua Fighter game</a>. Hopefully, now some sort of Skies of Arcadia revival won't be a pie in the sky dream after all.</p>

                <p>A modding group has released a mod that brings GTA: Vice City content into the GTA 4 engine, despite efforts from publisher Take-Two Interactive to stop them. This project by Revolution Team, called GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition, ported missions, cutscenes, and the world from Vice City into GTA 4's engine and initially required players to own a copy of GTA 4.</p><p>The development team said its YouTube channel was taken offline by Take-Two. That led to the creation of a new channel that houses a launch trailer for the mod, as well as a decision to rework the mod's requirement. Originally, the mod required GTA 4 to play--something that was done to "show respect to the publisher." Now, that requirement has been dropped, and the mod can be downloaded and played as a standalone game. As always, though, you should be careful about what you download online.</p><p>"Our team's channel was deleted by Take-Two Interactive two days before the project's release. A lot of time and effort was invested into its development, including hundreds of hours of streaming," Revolution Team's statement reads on an updated teaser trailer.</p><p>"[The teaser] gained over 100,000 views in less than a day. Unfortunately, it's absolutely impossible to restore it. We were forced to create a new channel, but it's unlikely that this trailer will reach the people who were truly waiting for it. Nevertheless, we're sharing the result of almost two years of hard work."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hqwmq6XT6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7hqwmq6XT6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Just last week, a mod known as Liberty City Preservation Project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reportedly-kills-another-gta-fan-project/1100-6528845/" data-ref-id="1100-6528845">was taken down after Rockstar contacted its creators</a>. "This isn't a DMCA, rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive," the Liberty City Preservation Project said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">GTA 6 is still set to release this year</a>. A parody game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parody-game-pulled-from-psn-resurfaces-on-steam/1100-6528952/" data-ref-id="1100-6528952">Grand Taking Ages</a> is also set to launch this year.

<p>First revealed during the The Game Awards last year, today's trailer now pops some off its focus on these "optional one-off adventures", which are nestled within the different levels of Split Fiction's main story.</p>
<p>This optional content is accessed via portals which Mio and Zoe can hop through, and includes moments where you can surf through a desert on the back of a giant sandfish or water ski behind a train. You know, as you do. In the words of studio founder Josef Fares, "this is side content you don't want to miss". You can check out the latest Split Fiction trailer below.</p>

<p>"Side Stories are anomalies that occur as a consequence of Mio and Zoe being stuck in the same simulation," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/an-introduction-to-side-stories">Hazelight furthered in a blog post</a>. "These portals are attempts by the simulation to steal unfinished stories and ideas that Mio and Zoe wrote when they were younger, leading to some truly weird, wonderful, and chaotic situations.</p><p>
"As these stories have been deeply influenced by our authors' pasts, they will experience long since forgotten ideas and secrets about themselves. Once a Side Story has been completed, our characters return back through the portal to the main level where they first entered the encounter, filled with even greater determination to escape from Rader’s machine with their memories and stories intact… so, going back to our original question, are you up to the challenge?"</p>

			<p>Despite having been only a one-off, few games have managed to leave a lasting impact on video games as much as Shadow of the Colossus did. Its unique atmosphere and storytelling and the tense battles against the gigantic colossi have etched themselves in the hearts of any who had the pleasure of experiencing them, turning the game into something truly special that has yet to be replicated, and understandably so, as the game by Fumito Ueda is really one of a kind.</p>
<p>The challenges coming with trying to attempt something unprecedented, however, did not stop Canada-based development studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-mike-laidlaw-new-studio-yellow-brick-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yellow Brick Games</a>. On the contrary, actually. While their debut game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-gamescom-hands-on-preview-magical-mayhem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eternal Strands</a>, is clearly inspired by that classic, this action-adventure title is also something more. It attempts to combine the intense fights against giant creatures seen in the PlayStation exclusive with exploration mechanics reminiscent of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a progression system inspired by the Monster Hunter series, a more involving narrative, and a truly impressive physics system that allows players to use the magical tools at main character Brynn's disposal in different ways to solve navigational puzzles and defeat both small and big enemies. Overall, this creates what can be considered in some ways to be as unique an experience as that of Shadow of the Colossus, albeit without the magical atmosphere of Fumito Ueda's legendary game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241231165255_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>One thing that Eternal Strands does not try to be is a narrative-driven experience, despite having been developed by Mike Laidlaw, the man behind one of the most celebrated narrative-driven RPG series ever made: the Dragon Age series. Still, the game does feature a tight narrative, with plenty of additional story content for those who want to experience more of the mystical realm of the Enclave, a magical city that ended up getting separated from the rest of the world by some sort of barrier known as the Rift. The young Weaver Brynn, together with other companions, manages to break through this Rift, enter the Enclave, explore its ruins, and eventually understand why and how the city was separated from the rest of the world and the dangers it hides.</p>
<p>While the world and the lore of Eternal Strands are definitely well-developed, with a lot of different political entities involved in the grand scheme of things, the story shouldn't be the main reason to play the game. It is most certainly not bad, but it's not particularly interesting either, as its pacing is extremely slow, and it is very predictable. The writing does not help much in this regard either, as conversations between characters tend to be a little long-winded and fail to keep the player's attention for long. After attempting to get into the story for the first 10 hours or so of the game, where literally nothing happens, my brain kind of checked out, but that's actually when Eternal Strands started getting good, as it is at this point that what feels like a massive tutorial session ends, and the game proper begins.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20241231173835_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At a glance, Eternal Strands doesn't look much different from your typical action-adventure game inspired by The Legend of Zelda. Controlling Brynn with a third-person perspective camera, players explore a variety of mid-sized maps featuring changeable weather conditions, including some extreme magical ones, defeat various enemies ranging from feral beasts to the magical Arks, the guardians of the Enclave, collect items to craft new gear and complete quests and generally try to stay alive as everything in the Enclave and its surroundings seem to want Brynn dead. It's the details, however, that make the difference in Eternal Strands' case. While exploration mechanics never truly take off (although they do improve as more magical powers are unlocked) since there isn't a whole lot to discover in maps besides items of interest that provide additional information on the game's universe and blueprints for new gear, it's the combat that truly elevates the experience, especially in the fights against the bigger enemies where the game turns into a unique combination between Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus.</p>
<p>While the three available basic weapons - sword and shield, two-hander, and bow - don't feel particularly satisfying to use, at least in their basic, non-elemental variations, also due to the limited stamina pool - the special powers Brynn can learn during the course of the adventure definitely succeed in that regard. Thanks to the game's advanced simulation mechanics, the entire game world essentially becomes a huge playground for the player to experiment with.</p>
<p>Fighting multiple enemies at the same time? Hurl them against one another. An enemy is way too mobile for your taste? Freeze them in place. Enemies are standing on leaves? Set them on fire to watch these enemies melt away. These are only a couple of the most basic things that can be done in Eternal Strands thanks to its physics engine, as multiple powers can be combined together for maximum efficacy. For example, it is essentially possible to create some sort of magical cannon to hurl debris at enemies, even flying ones; to make another, it is possible to use a gravity bomb of sorts that attracts everything in its vicinity to create a pressurized fire or ice bomb that will go off after some time to unleash elemental attacks in a wider range.</p>
<p>These elemental attacks also interact with the environment and with specific enemy types in a lot of different ways, forcing the player to adapt to the situation to win against some of them. Some enemies, for example, are covered in thick armor, and to damage them, you will need to find a way to make the armor brittle. In other cases, they have a massive shield that absorbs all damage, and you will need to get rid of this shield to damage them. Depending on how the enemy is defeated, they have higher chances of dropping specific items, so it's always a good idea to get creative and either burn or freeze enemies to death if you're looking for a certain material.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250103012516_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The similarities with Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus emerge in Eternal Strands when fighting the big enemies featured in the game, the Epics. Much like in Fumito Ueda's masterpiece, it is possible to climb on these big enemies to hit their weak points and defeat them, all the while using the elemental powers to gain some sort of advantage. The first time Brynn encounters them, she can defeat them by simply depleting their health to obtain a new power, but to further enhance this power, it will be necessary to absorb their essence, which can only be done after following a specific strategy to expose it, which often involves destroying certain parts of theirs, forcing them to perform certain actions and so on.</p>
<p>What must be done to expose their essence is highlighted in the in-game codex, which does an excellent job at providing hints without saying outright what must be done, although towards the end of the game, once a good understanding of the mechanics has been reached, it becomes possible to expose the big creatures' essences without the codex's help. This is actually a testament to the great enemy design, as the visual clues make the whole operation feel very organic with the combat mechanics. I just wish there were more of these Epic enemies, as fighting mobs becomes stale rather quickly in comparison, especially considering that character progression is limited to crafting new items, including elemental variations of all three weapon types that spice up the experience considerably, giving players more options. So, there aren't many reasons to fight them if the player doesn't need to farm items. However, we do know that more Epics are coming after launch, thanks to the partnership with Square Enix's Creative Studio III, which is helping design new creatures.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, character progression in Eternal Strands is limited to crafting and enhancing gear, and it's in this aspect that the game feels the most like the Monster Hunter series. Each equipment piece, which can only be crafted after finding the appropriate blueprint, comes with a passive skill that alters Brynn's abilities, such as higher health or stamina, faster mana restoration, and so on. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these passive skills are very basic and not particularly exciting, so don't expect to find the same involved build crafting seen in the CAPCOM series. Still, the system definitely has some interesting twists, as it is possible to slightly alter gear abilities by using different materials and even reforge pieces that have already been crafted to enhance them. The materials used also determine the color of the gear, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>While the gameplay loop is definitely simplified over that of the Monster Hunter series, in many ways, Eternal Strands manages to evoke those "one more run" feelings the CAPCOM series does, especially between the 10 and 20-hour mark, as exploration and combat finally become fun after the slog that is the beginning of the adventure. Unfortunately, the experience kind of takes a dive in the second half of the adventure, as it features very little new content.</p>
<p>At this point, all the maps have been discovered, all the big enemies have been fought, and most of the powers obtained and leveled up, taking away the sense of discovery that makes most of the first half of the experience fun, leaving only an uninteresting barrage of quests set in maps the player should know well at that point, and the uneventful story. It's a shame the game is so long, requiring close to 35 hours to complete, as it would have been a much tighter experience if it only ended shortly after unlocking the final map. The lack of new content in the second half of the experience is understandable, considering Yellow Brick Games is a small team, but cutting down the playtime would have been ultimately beneficial, in my opinion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20250107190545_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to visuals, Eternal Strands definitely delivers despite not featuring the most advanced graphics to date. Still, Yellow Brick Games took great advantage of the Unreal Engine 5 features to deliver some pleasant and colorful visuals in the vein of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Immortals: Fenyx Rising, giving the entire experience a unique feel with well-detailed fantasy locations and stylized character models that work quite well together.</p>
<p>The developer also managed to keep the known UE5 stuttering issues to a minimum, as the game runs rather well most of the time. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at 4K resolution, epic settings with NVIDIA DLSS at the Ultra Quality setting, and Frame Generation at an average of 118 FPS in a benchmark session held in the Upper Dynevron map, one of the maps featuring the highest enemy density. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation off, the game ran at an average of 89 FPS on the same map, which was extremely playable. The recorded 1% lows, 25 and 35, however, highlight how there's still some stuttering here and there, but it's honestly not that noticeable. Considering the state of the vast majority of Unreal Engine 5 games and all the taxing simulation the game is doing at almost all times, I was expecting much worse, but there hasn't been a single time in my 35+ hours playthrough where framerates dipped so low the game was unplayable.</p>

<p>Despite the beginning and the end of the adventure being kind of a slog and the predictable story, there's no denying that Eternal Strands is a solid action-adventure game that does a lot of things right, especially its combat mechanics and its fights against giant monsters that masterfully combine mechanics from Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus. Hopefully, Yellow Brick Games will get the chance to do one more entry in the series in the future and tweak the solid foundation they have created to build a better well-rounded experience that can stay fun from beginning to end.</p>

				<p>Despite pulling features and mechanics from a variety of different series, Eternal Strands manages to feel like a cohesive experience that really shines once players get the hang of its advanced physics and combat system. However, the average story and the game's repetitive latter half hold it back from being truly fantastic, making it a solid action-adventure that's just a few steps away from greatness.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Barry also says People Can Fly "can't share more just yet", so if you were hoping for more details than the scant teaser trailer provides, then you're sadly out of luck.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is, it's a prequel set fourteen years before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Gears of War</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement" rel="nofollow">last year's Xbox summer showcase</a>, the game will once again star Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago as they deal with the beginnings of the Locust invasion.</p>

<p>We don't know a lot about&nbsp;<em>E-Day&nbsp;</em>yet, although we do know it'll <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/gears-of-war-e-day-director-says-the-new-shooter-will-absolutely-be-doing-more-linear-levels-instead-of-gear-5s-open-ended-maps/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">focus more</a> on the linear levels for which the series became known rather than the open-ended levels of&nbsp;<em>Gears 5</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gears of War: E-Day&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010850/Gears_of_War_EDay/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/gears-of-war-eday" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet.

            <p>Look up, planet-lubber. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers-2">Space Engineers 2</a> launches into the starry depths of early access today, although it is currently limited to a single player creative mode. It's the sequel to the sci-fi shipbuilding game we quite enjoyed here at RPS. At this early alpha stage, the not-yet-a-survival-game invites players to create galleons of the galaxy, block by shiny metal block, and then drive those ships into one another at 300 metres per second. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's the new top speed you can travel in this sandbox sequel, we're told. And you don't even need a ship to reach it. Step into the vacuum to discover your boosty backpack will send your little spaceman flyin', so you can catch up to any drifting vessels.</p>

<p>The other new stuff so far includes a fancier graphics engine, a more stable camera while you're wandering on space rocks, undo and redo functions, and the ability to make "blueprints" for quick modular gizmo duplication. Not to mention an improved grid for the block-building system (in short: big, medium, and small blocks now snap together more intuitively).</p><p>The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> slowly dug itself a deep well of features over its own years-long journey through early access. It's one of our reader's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-space-games-of-all-time">best space games</a>. That means developers Keen will be playing a bit of "content catch-up". Their <a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2/#current">development roadmap</a> shows a few plans. They're going to add planets, multiplayer, NPCs, a story mode, and a bunch of other stuff, they say. Although the road map doesn't say exactly when each new shipment of goodies is planned to arrive.</p>
<p>Regardless, I have today strapped myself in to watch the various tutorials and briefing videos Keen Software have been steadily drip-feeding us, like zero-gravity lab rodents. There's a smattering posted on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419466">news feed on Steam</a>. I'll need them. The committee for space antics at RPS has appointed me meteor-explorer-in-chief, and requested a timely review of what this game is like to play so far. I travel in ill-fated footsteps. Not because the previous game was bad - far from it. But because a four-person crew of our finest wayfarers once shot off into that inky frontier and reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-engineers-diary-part-one-wolves">descended into space madness</a> over the course of a few months, culminating in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/death-and-betrayal-aboard-a-vast-steel-space-spider">a terrible disaster</a>. </p>
<p>I'm sure I'll be fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-first-escape-room-was-pretty-cool.1092897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/escape-room-first-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My main knowledge of escape rooms is that <em>Bob’s Burgers</em> <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8254030/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">episode</a> where two angry couples are trapped together in a crappy puzzle room, though my perception of them was slanted before that, too; I always imagined them as slightly hokey gimmicks perfectly calibrated to get you to fight with your friends. But I did my first one yesterday, and I actually enjoyed it a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, four friends and I went to Mysstic Rooms’ “<a href="https://www.myssticrooms.com/rooms/montauk-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Montauk Project</a>,” one of several experiences housed in an unassuming building in Brooklyn. The room itself had a loose plot about uncovering a mystery on an old Air Force base; my first surprise came from the fact that it wasn’t just a single locked room. I don’t want to spoil it (the escape room people were very uptight about spoilers, which is fair!), but it involved following a variety of clues and solving puzzles to power items, open padlocks, unlock doors, and uncover secret compartments.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m familiar with solving game puzzles from video games, but it felt really different to solve them in the real world. The physicality of it all heightened the way that game puzzles don’t always make narrative sense (why would moving X object cause Y to happen), but this suspension of disbelief seems necessary to make interesting puzzles to solve. Some of the puzzles got their complexity from requiring solving other puzzles to get their necessary parts, while others were standalone. Some were fairly obvious, while others required steps that wouldn’t have occurred to me and made me glad I was with a group. It was fun to rush around a room opening things and flipping over objects, and rewarding to have a physical response to solving a puzzle correctly.</p><p>The staff member running our room watched our entire hour-long session on a camera and intercom and was available to give us hints if we asked (both they and the website said it was totally OK to ask for hints, which I probably wouldn’t have done on my own). They also weighed in on occasion when they overheard us not being sure if we’d done something right, and in one moment when something accidentally triggered too early. At one point, I wondered aloud to my friends if it drove the staff crazy watching people try to solve the rooms when they knew the solution; the staffer butted in with a deadpan “yes.”</p><p>I was impressed with the way the room was designed to minimize getting stuck on the wrong path. The staffer told us in advance that puzzles were single use, and that the room didn’t require backtracking, which was helpful advice. There was minimal unnecessary decoration, and many things that weren’t clues were bolted down or clearly inoperable. (The staffer told us that people have often broken things in the rooms.) I assumed that a lot of the puzzles were manually operated by the staffer, but they told us afterwards that most of the room ran on sensors and magnets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’m pleased that my friends and I worked together well and didn’t devolve into bickering, especially as time started to run out. After we’d beat the room, our staffer told us they’d seen plenty of people fight, either because of the room or because they seemed to be in a fight when they got there. They also said they’d seen lots of first dates to escape rooms, which seems like a terrible idea for a first date to me, but also an admirably bold choice.</p><p>I was really curious about how the room’s design and staff interaction work with the time limit. Unlike a video game, where you have all the time in the world to poke around and go down dead ends once you buy the game, it seems tough to me to design a physical experience with a firm end, where you’d have to pay and start all over if you couldn’t beat it. I wondered how designers balance making a room hard enough that players would find it fair if they couldn’t solve it, while also making it solvable by a wide range of people without making it too easy. Our staffer told me that there are lots of things they can do behind the scenes to move players along, and that they can decide how much to help depending on how a group is approaching the room and how they seem to feel about solving it. It got me really curious about how escape rooms are designed and playtested, where you have to weigh so many constraints against the limitless ways a group of people might think. (If you are one of our Aftermath readers who works on these kinds of experiences, please weigh in!)</p><p>Overall, I was surprised to enjoy it as much as I did. I’ve played boardgames or <em>D&amp;D</em> with these same friends, but I don’t do a lot of game-playing in the real world or with other people, so it was a nice change of pace. It also got me curious to check out other escape rooms, not something I ever thought I would say. It definitely doesn’t seem like a good first date activity, though.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media"><h3>G/O Media Is Publishing AI Slop Again</h3></a><p>News site Quartz is publishing a whole lot of AI-generated articles</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The challenging times at Ubisoft continue, as the French gaming company has announced it is closing one studio and downsizing others in the firm's latest round of cost-cutting that will see about 185 people lose their jobs. Ubisoft underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">multiple waves of layoffs in 2024 as well.</a></p><p>Ubisoft has confirmed that it is closing Ubisoft Leamington, a support studio that contributed to titles like Star Wars Outlaws and Far Cry 5. The team created the DJ Hero series for Activision before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-buys-guitar-hero-live-dj-hero-dev-from-act/1100-6447034/" data-ref-id="1100-6447034">acquired by Ubisoft in 2017.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft told GameSpot that is is closing Ubisoft Leamington as part of the company's ongoing mission to "prioritize projects and reduce costs." In addition to closing Ubisoft Leamington, Ubisoft is undergoing "targeted restructurings" of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition," Ubisoft said.</p><p>This dramatic action wasn't totally unexpected, as Ubisoft said in a memo to investors in early January that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">continuing to look for ways to "drive significant cost reductions" in the business.</a> Ubisoft added that it will take a "highly selective approach to investments" during this period. In total, Ubisoft said it expects to see a reduction of €200 million ($206 million USD) as part of this plan.</p><p>This is all happening amid reports that have suggested Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">may be working with Tencent on some kind of business arrangement</a> to solidify its future. During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">conference call</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value.</p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft will releases its latest earnings report on February 13, at which time the company may share additional information about its future outlook. The company <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enters a "quiet period" beginning January 29</a>, so no one should expect Ubisoft to make specific announcements about its future business outlook between January 29 and February 13.</p>
