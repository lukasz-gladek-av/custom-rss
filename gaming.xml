The patch added a ton of content, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-tmnt-turtles-80-90-bundle-battle-pass-s2-1851765490">including some really expensive <em>TMNT </em>skins</a></span>, new weapons, and‚Äîmost importantly for <em>THPS </em>fans out there‚ÄîGrind, a skateboard park map. And it‚Äôs in here that we got out latest piece of evidence that a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>video game is soon to be announced. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Charlie Intel </em>on Twitter</a></span>, in the new Grind map, you can find a skate shop area and in there you can spot a small poster that clearly includes the OG <em>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater </em>logo as well as a date: March 4, 2025. In response to the teaser, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tony Hawk himself simply replied with eyeball emojis</a></span>, seemingly confirming that, yeah, this is for sure a teaser for a new game. (Xbox on Twitter also replied with the same emoji.) </p><p>Why did this appear in a <em>Call of Duty </em>game? Well, remember that before Activision was a <em>Call of Duty </em>machine, it published all the past <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. So this seems to be a bit of corporate synergy. How fun!</p><p>This is just the latest (and most concrete) evidence of a new <em>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-new-game-remaster-leak-confirmed-1851765242">Earlier this week</a></span> a skateboarder who appeared in the last game, 2020's <em>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 1+2,</em> claimed he‚Äôs appearing in a new <em>Tony Hawk</em> ‚Äúremaster.‚Äù <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawk-pro-skater-activision-new-game-confirmed-thps-1851646946">And in 2024</a></span>, Tony Hawk himself claimed the series had a future and that he was working with Activision again. </p><p>And on top of all that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Wednesday, it was reported</a></span> that Microsoft (which owns Activision) was planning to announce and release a new <em>Tony Hawk </em>game in June as part of a yet-to-be-announced summer event. The game is reportedly <em>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 3+4</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426?_gl=1*emnk8d*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg5NTkzMy4yMDAuMS4xNzM5ODk4NDQyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-call-duty-activision-1851459426?_gl=1*emnk8d*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTg5NTkzMy4yMDAuMS4xNzM5ODk4NDQyLjYwLjAuMA..">a project that was pitched years ago</a></span> but which Activision passed on. The game is claimed to be called ‚ÄúProject Chicago‚Äù internally and is set to shadow drop during the Xbox event this Summer. </p><p>We‚Äôll have to wait and see if that report is accurate and just what that <em>Call of Duty</em> map is teasing, but it does seem like something is coming pretty soon and as a massive <em>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater</em> fan, I‚Äôm excited. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Included with an ammo chest of new features, weapons, and more content was the return of the fan-favorite skate-themed map, Grind. The skatepark arena has been brought back mostly as fans remember it, with one exception being a giant, in-game TV screen featuring a very Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater-looking logo and a date of March 4, 2025.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6‚Äôs Grind MP map!</p><p>Announcement on March 4. üëÄ <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p></div>‚Äî CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It stops short of being in-your-face but is still undeniably an eyebrow-raising reference for fans who have been on the lookout for another entry in the Pro Skater series. Rumors that another installment could soon be announced began earlier this week when fellow skater Tyshawn Jones let it slip that he would soon be featured in an upcoming Tony Hawk video game (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-skater-claims-hes-in-a-new-tony-hawk-remaster-about-to-come-out/#google_vignette" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>VGC</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a Tony Hawk coming out, so that‚Äôs cool,‚Äù Jones said during a conversation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3umK3xG7Ly4&amp;t=1s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Breakfast Club podcast</u></a>. ‚ÄúThey got a new one they remastering so that‚Äôs about to come out.

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no telling what exactly that March date has in store.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision tried to breathe life into the franchise with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5">Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 5</a> back in 2015 but has yet to release another new numbered entry since.

Although there are a handful of crash fixes, there aren't many major issues at all in this patch, which Warhorse is calling Hotfix 1.1.2. Instead, the most exciting revision comes in The King's Gambit, where players can now keep the wine flowing for the king.</p><p>As related on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1imfa12/kcd2_cant_pick_up_white_wine_during_the_kings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, some players ran into an issue in The King's Gambit where the option to pour wine for the king disappears. When the king asks to switch from red wine to white, players failed the task when they couldn't fulfil that simple request.</p><p>Warhorse shared the Hotfix 1.1.2 breakdown on <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hotfix-1-1-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>. According to the developers, the primary adjustments include stability improvements and quest fixes. There's also a specific fix for the game on the Epic Games Store. Taken together, these changes may not seem very significant, but they're meant to help players have a more refined experience.</p><p>So far, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has been a massive hit for Warhorse Studios. It sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-tops-1-million-copies-sold-in-a-single-day/1100-6529264/" data-ref-id="1100-6529264">1 million copies in its first 24 hours</a>, and recently passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">the 2 million mark</a> as well.

Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-mods-are-coming-get-a-first-peek-with-henry-holding-a-fish/1100-6529434/" data-ref-id="1100-6529434">official mod support is coming</a> to the PC version of the game as well.</p><p>Players have also found entertaining details in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-a-secret-ending-you-only-see-if-youre-the-worst-person-ever/1100-6529439/" data-ref-id="1100-6529439">a hidden ending</a> that can only be achieved by letting the main character embrace all of his worst instincts.

                <p>EA and Hazelight Studios have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/it-takes-two/about/friends-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed information</a> about how Split Fiction's Friend's Pass and cross-play between different platforms work. There's even a free trial for players who don't own the game.</p><p>Similar to Hazelight's previous co-op games like It Takes Two and A Way Out, Split Fiction also offers a Friend's Pass. This allows players who bought the game to connect with someone who doesn't have a copy, and play through the game in its entirety. But this time, Split Fiction's version has some expanded features that weren't in those previous games, such as cross-platform play.</p><h2>How does Split Fiction's work?</h2><p>The first step is that one person has to own the game, whether it'd be a physical or digital copy. The next step is to have a buddy download Split Fiction's Friend's Pass on their chosen platform, whether it'd be PC, PlayStation, or Xbox through their respective digital storefronts. Just be aware that if you and your friend are playing on different platforms, for example PC and PlayStation, both of you need an EA account.</p><p>Next, the person who owns Split Fiction should send an in-game invite to their friend, whom then accepts the invite. Once that step is completed, both players can play through the entire game together.</p><p>What happens if neither of you own the game? No problem. The Friend's Pass offers a free trial for both players which includes the opening stages of Split Fiction. Both players will need to download the Friend's Pass version of the game, and once either of you purchase the full game, progresses can be continued.</p><p>Another aspect to note is that in It Takes Two and A Way Out, the player who was on the Friend's Pass version did not unlock trophies or achievements on their platform, while the one who owned the game did. At least in A Way Out, if the player on the Friend's Pass decides to purchase the full game later on, <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/a-way-out/a-way-out/play-a-way-out-with-the-friends-pass/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they will retroactively earn the trophies and achievements</a> they would have unlocked while on the pass. It's unknown whether this is the same case for Split Fiction.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AAzbMPitPI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>How does cross-play in Split Fiction work?</h2><p>It Takes Two and A Way Out didn't have cross-play, meaning that both players had to be on the same platform in order to play with each other.

			<p>Today, Hazelight Studios announced that their highly anticipated new adventure game Split Fiction will be playable through crossplay across all platforms. This greatly enhances any player's ability to play with their friends since Split Fiction, like Hazelight's prior games, is co-op only.</p>
<p>But there's more. While the studio's previous games also implemented free passes for friends, enticing a casual gamer to play with a more hardcore gamer who bought the game, this time there's an evolution of that.</p>
<p>Through the Friend's Pass Trial, even if neither player owns a copy of Split Fiction, they can still experience a trial version using the Friend's Pass. Once they both download and launch the Friend's Pass version of the game, they will unlock the opportunity to invite each other to play the opening stages of the game together. If they like the game, they can progress if just one of them purchases a full copy of the game, which will be priced at $49.99 when it launches on March 6 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store and the EA app.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | How to Invite a Friend for Free with the Friend's Pass" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AAzbMPitPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Josef Fares and his team garnered widespread acclaim, especially with their latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won several Game of the Year awards. Split Fiction is also about a duo, although a very different one.</p>
<p>This time, players will step into the roles of Mio and Zoe. They're both writers, although one writes sci-fi, and the other fantasy, and they have wildly different personalities. They both find themselves trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. Relying on each other to escape with their memories intact, they work together to master a variety of skills and overcome various challenges as they jump between sci-fi and fantasy worlds in what Hazelight promises will be an unexpected tale of friendship. The full PC system requirements for Split Fiction are available below.</p>

Well, I‚Äôm pleased to report that after spending several hours with it, it‚Äôs exactly as goofy and over-the-top as the title suggests. This cartoonish co-op adventure gives off a distinct Saturday-morning cartoon vibe with its bright colors, absurd gags, and dorky aliens with wacky voices, and blends 3rd-person action with real-time strategy elements that have really piqued my interest. But don‚Äôt be fooled by its family friendly ornamentation! As one might expect from a strategy game with XCOM creator Julian Gollop at the helm, this thing already started to show just how deceptively challenging it can be during my short time with it, which has left me eager to see more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chip ‚Äòn Clawz vs. The Brainioids threw me right into the middle of the action without much context behind its completely bonkers premise ‚Äì and I was extremely okay with that. I mean, what‚Äôs not to get about a reckless human named Chip and a robot kitten named Clawz, fighting against an alien race of brains inside jars called the Brainioids? My co-op friend and I worked our way through increasingly tricky levels filled with relentless alien baddies sent to kill us by someone named General Blobbius (who is not a military general, but the general manager of the Brainioids corporation, because of course he is). If you couldn‚Äôt tell already, Chip ‚ÄòN Clawz doesn‚Äôt exactly take itself seriously, to its enormous benefit. From the brightly-colored levels, dopey looking enemies, and ongoing childish banter, it immediately oozes a kid-friendly charm that lured me into a false sense of security that maybe this would be a pretty easy ride, even though I‚Äôd selected hard mode.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Chip ‚ÄòN Clawz vs. The Brainioids - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Our objective was the same for most levels: battle our way through alien hordes and destroy the mothership at the far end of the map using a legion of robotic minions as our allies. To do so, we have to work together to collect Brainium (the resource used for building) and make decisions about what to spend it on, whether that be the construction of new factories or to power up individual units so they‚Äôre more effective in combat. But what started out as a fairly by-the-numbers action game with light RTS components became more complex with each level, until we found ourselves screaming at the screen and at each other in a panic, as we were overwhelmed by the enemy on multiple fronts. That‚Äôs because Chip ‚Äòn Clawz definitely knows what it‚Äôs doing in the real-time strategy department, and in between the time I spent running around the map bonking aliens about with my melee weapon, I was toggling over to the build and command modes, which allowed me to construct new facilities or order my minions around, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are loads of things to consider, as Chip ‚Äòn Clawz slowly introduces new factories to build, units to control, and upgrades to apply to your character‚Äôs loadout that modify your abilities. You might, for example, want to take a perk that upgrades all your mining units that gather resources for building so that they‚Äôre faster and can withstand more damage from the enemy, or you might instead prefer to just deal more damage with your own melee weapons if you prefer to do more of your own dirty work. Then, during a certain level you might decide to spend your resources on a new artillery depot that supplies your character with a long-range gun, or alternatively you could use that Brainium to construct some stationary turrets to fend off enemies in the area automatically.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you‚Äôre introduced to more and more things to consider, the enemy quickly levels up their tactics as well, which spirals into some surprisingly formidable encounters. One level had me defending our mobile base from enemy attack on three different fronts while controlling dozens of units, while another required me to construct vehicles and jetpacks to reach far away areas in search of resources I needed to win the day. The jokey tone combined with frantic levels overflowing with ruthless alien goons reminded me a lot of the Overcooked series, which uses its seemingly simple mechanics and cheery art to disguise the friendships it will surely ruin in the coming hours. Similarly, Chip ‚Äòn Clawz cleverly disguises its difficulty by being one of the most immediately approachable RTS games I‚Äôve played, luring you into a false sense of security with its third-person action mechanics, but then hilariously kicks you in the face with demanding levels that require you to lean more and more into its complicated RTS mechanics a short time later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I feel like I‚Äôve only seen the tip of the iceberg from this surprisingly deep strategy game, and am looking forward to seeing how crazy things can get in later levels.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/history-evaporating-before-our-eyes-gamers-lament-twitchs-new-video-storage-limits/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>Popular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/amazon-not-google-reportedly-buying-twitch-for-1-billion/">Amazon-owned</a> game streaming platform Twitch <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announced Wednesday</a> that it will be imposing a 100-hour limit on the archived video highlights users can preserve permanently on the site. And while Twitch says that only 0.5 percent of users will be affected by these new limits, gamers are warning that the move threatens to eradicate large swaths of recent gaming history from the Internet.</p>
<p>Highlights, in Twitch's own words, are a way for Twitch streamers to "show off your best moments to new viewers who land on your channel page." Unlike VOD recordings of full Twitch broadcasts‚Äîwhich are deleted automatically after seven days (or 60 days for Twitch partners)‚Äîthese highlights provide a more permanent way to maintain an archive of important moments for many Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>That seeming permanence is set to end on April 29, though, when Twitch says it will start to delete content from channels with more than 100 hours of highlights, starting with the least-viewed highlights.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/video-on-demand">announcing the change</a>, Twitch cited the "costly" indefinite storage of these highlights, which it says are responsible for "less than 0.1% of hours watched" across the site. These highlights "haven't been very effective in driving discovery or engagement with viewers," Twitch wrote, and limiting them will "help us manage resources more efficiently... and continue to invest in new features and improvements to more effective viewer engagement tools like Clips and the mobile feed."</p>
<h2>An ‚Äúincalculable‚Äù loss</h2>
<p>On social media, though, many Twitch users are expressing outrage over what the loss of these clips will do to the shared history of their gaming communities. "Who the hell cares about discovery or engagement?" one streamer <a href="https://x.com/MrJimmysteel25/status/1892421085418643523">wrote</a>. "People use highlights to archive, and you're destroying YEARS of speedrunning and other communities' history."</p>
<p>The speedrunning community seems particularly likely to be negatively affected by Twitch's move. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTuber">VTuber</a> VanityFox <a href="https://x.com/VanityyFox/status/1892588675306815995">points out</a>, "many speedrunners use highlights to document world records and important moments... the amount gaming history they are deleting to save money and shove short form content on your feed is incalculable."</p>

                <p>Innersloth has made a series of Among Us announcements, including a brand-new game: Among Us 3D. A demo for the game, which shifts the perspective to a first-person view, will be available during Steam Next Fest beginning on February 24.</p><p>Among Us 3D for Steam allows players to join cross-platform lobbies with people playing Among Us in VR on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO. "Fans can expect the same intense, fast-paced gameplay, complete with voice chat, new customization options, game modes, roles, and all the deception-filled fun--without the need for a VR headset," Innersloth said in its announcement.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsx-s-upgrade-for-free-in-march.1114680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/gta-v-on-pc-gets-the-ps5-xsxs-upgrade-for-free-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rockstar has announced that Grand Theft Auto V on PC is getting a free upgrade, rolling in all the enhancements that were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/04/gta-v-and-gta-online-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date-set-for-15th-march/">made for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S back in 2022</a>. This includes new vehicles at Hao‚Äôs Special Works, animal encounters, improved graphics, faster load times and more.</p>
<p>The free upgrade will available from 4th March 2025.</p>


<p>Instead of just being a patch to download, this will be a new version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-v">GTA V</a>, and though it will be dished out for free, it will come with a one-time character migration for story and online, and will not be backward compatible for play between versions.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ quite odd, though can be pinned on the increased system requirements for graphical changes. It‚Äôs also quite odd that Rockstar are getting round to this now, three years after the same upgrade came to consoles. At the very least, they‚Äôre not trying to double-dip on this for PC, considering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/08/gta-5-online-ps5-cheap-upgrade-pre-load-character-save-migration-xbox-series-x/">the triple-dip that console players saw</a>!</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the breakdown from Rockstar:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enjoy a range of new vehicles and upgrades at Hao‚Äôs Special Works (HSW) that push automotive performance to new heights, and test your driving skills with Premium Test Rides, HSW Races, and HSW Time Trials.</li>
<li>Encounter Ambient Animals all across Southern San Andreas and take pictures of them to participate in the daily Wildlife Photography Challenge for new rewards.</li>
<li>PC players can sign up for GTA+ Membership to get special benefits in the upgraded version of <em>GTA Online</em> and beyond.</li>
<li>Track your criminal movements across all of <em>GTA Online</em>‚Äôs updates with the Career Progress feature as you build your empire.</li>
<li>Navigate a refreshed Landing Page as your starting destination to get straight into the action. Plus, take advantage of an improved introductory flow for newer players with a GTA$4,000,000 windfall to buy property, vehicles, and other items as you start off as an Executive, Gunrunner, Nightclub Owner or Biker in the Career Builder.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the technical side of things, there‚Äôs also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ray tracing features only available on PC such as ambient occlusion and global illumination ‚Äî plus ray traced shadows and reflections first debuted on consoles</li>
<li>Support for AMD FSR1 and FSR3, and NVIDIA DLSS 3</li>
<li>Faster loading times using SSD and DirectStorage on supported devices and configurations</li>
<li>Enhanced support for higher resolutions, higher aspect ratios, and higher framerates</li>
<li>DualSense controller support, with adaptive triggers</li>
<li>Enhanced audio with support for Dolby Atmos and improved fidelity of speech, cinematics, and music</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason why this is an optional upgrade is that the minimum requirements have increased. In particular on the GPU side of things, you‚Äôre jumping forward to the GeForce 1630 and Radeon 6400, compared to the GeForce 9800 GT 1GB / AMD HD 4870 1GB. You also need to run the game from an SSD.</p>

<p>One final oddity, this is all happening less than a year before the expected launch of GTA 6. Take Two has repeatedly affirmed that GTA 6 is expected to launch in late 2025, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">since stating this release window last May</a>. That release is only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though, with Rockstar always preferring to turn to the PC after the consoles. Recent reports have suggested that GTA 6 could come to PC in early 2026, but we‚Äôll just have to wait and see on that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-gets-another-major-tease/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The signs pointing to the next Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater game continue to find their way out, this time via a tease in a different Activision game.  </p>



<p>Spotted in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6‚Äôs Grind map, there is a skateboard area with a logo similar to that of Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skate 1 + 2. Within that logo reads a date: March 4, 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Coincidently, if you go by month-date-year formatting, the month and day equates to 3-4, the expected next remaster from the classic skateboarding series. </p>



<p>The latest tease comes just days after pro skater&nbsp;Tyshawn Jones said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-tony-hawks-pro-skater-remaster-is-coming-skater-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview</a> that a new game was ‚Äúabout to come out‚Äù. It was then followed up with claims from eXtas1s that the game will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-thps-remasters-will-shadow-drop-at-xbox-summer-showcase-its-claimed/">be shadow dropped</a> when it launches.</p>



<p>Tony Hawk‚Äôs Pro Skater 1+2‚Äîa remaster of the first two games‚Äîlaunched in 2020. That game was developed by Vicarious Visions, which has since been rebranded as Blizzard Albany after becoming fully merged into Blizzard Entertainment in 2022. There were talks that the follow up remaster was in development, but that it had been cancelled sometime in 2021-2022. In September 2024, however, Hawk himself said that there would be a future for the franchise as it celebrated its 25th Anniversary and that it was something <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he was excited about</a>.</p>



<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future,‚Äù Hawk said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-continues-to-tease-future-pro-skater-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram post</a>.</p>
