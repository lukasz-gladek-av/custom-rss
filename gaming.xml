			<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202409/18892" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Famitsu</a> about the Nintendo Museum that is due to open on October 2, industry legend Shigeru Miyamoto made some interesting comments about Nintendo's uniqueness and its desire to stand apart from what he called the 'performance console war' between Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox.</p>
<p><em>If the goal is to preserve all of Nintendo's past assets so that people can understand what Nintendo is, then it's not just about the employees; we now have people spanning three generations who know about Nintendo. It would be great if those people could see it and understand what Nintendo is. I hope that through this, people will understand and refrain from dragging Nintendo into competitions like the so-called 'console wars,' which focus on high specs and hardware performance (laughs). Nintendo will continue to use the various technologies available today to create things in a way that's unique to Nintendo. We're not just limited to games; we'll also be involved in films and will continue to create a variety of entertainment content. I thought this would be a good opportunity for people to understand that, and that's why we made this.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe the most important thing is for various people to visit this museum and come away thinking, 'This is a company that's not at all related to the game industry competition or cutting-edge technology that people usually talk about.' Of course, we conduct technology research. In the past, analysts and others have said things like, 'Why isn't Nintendo focusing on networking?' or 'What about mobile?' or 'Why aren't you using cutting-edge chips?' However, if people calmly look at the exhibits, they'll realize that we've actually been working on those things all along. But Nintendo has a history of waiting for the right moment to release products, only commercializing them when we believe the timing is perfect. I think that becomes clear through the museum, and it helps build trust in Nintendo. For our shareholders as well, this serves as a kind of mid-to-long-term perspective, showing that they can trust us to manage the company properly.</em></p>
<p>With the unveiling of the Switch 2 believed to be imminent (the console is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-official-name-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to have already entered full production), Miyamoto's comments may be interpreted as a way to prepare fans when the official specifications have been revealed. Indeed, from the leaks and rumors, the Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be even less powerful than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Nintendo has long since detached itself from the aforementioned 'performance console war'. The last time the Japanese company produced a console as powerful as its competitors was with the GameCube, which was unsuccessful commercially. Following that experience, Nintendo avoided fighting Nintendo and Sony in raw computing power and designed its consoles with specific gimmicks, such as motion controls for the Wii, the gamepad/touchscreen for the WiiU, and the hybrid handheld/home console for the Switch. Two out of three times, they were right; we'll see if whatever they come up with for the Nintendo Switch 2 will be a success or not.</p>

<p>The announcement of the next-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards are still some time away, but we may have new information of what people can expect thanks to new leaks.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1839381163749904634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the company’s flagship RTX 5090 graphics card will feature 32GB GDDR7 memory with a TGP of 600W. The upper-mid range RTX 5080 will have 16GB of GDDR7 memory and a TGP of 400W.</p>







<p>For comparison purposes, the RTX 4090 has a TGP of 450W while the RTX 4080 has a TGP of 320W. </p>



<p>More details, including a full reveal of the RTX 50 Series graphics cards are expected to come at, or around, CES 2025 in January.</p>



<p>These are the first set of leaks for the upcoming lineup of graphics cards. Earlier in September <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-to-consume-more-power-than-40-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was also reported</a> that the RTX 50 Series would consume more power than the previous generation. ExTas1s claim seems to corroborate that information. It was also first reported in July that the next set of cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-50-series-may-not-release-until-2025-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t come until 2025.</a></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on the leaks, but no response was received as of publishing.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A real-life Destiny-themed Nerf gun is nothing new, with Bungie having previously released a giant replica of the Gjallarhorn rocket launcher. But the upcoming Ace of Spades Nerf blaster feels decidedly different, both in terms of its usability and the fact that this particular gun choice resonates more deeply with the story of Destiny 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie recently sent me the Ace of Spades, which I've spent the last few days playing around with, much to the disdain and horror, respectively, of my two cats. Not having seen any dimensions listed for the blaster prior to it showing up at my door, I was shocked to open the shipping box: This thing is <em>big. </em>It's about 18 inches from the tip of the handle to the end of the barrel, which may not sound enormous for something you'd display on your shelf, but as a handgun you're actually going to hold and use, it's hard not to laugh at just how big it is when first seeing it. They don't call them hand cannons in Destiny for nothing, I guess.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374223"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades makes a Nintendo Switch look tiny</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374223-aceofspadesswitch.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not to say the size is a bad thing--quite the opposite. The scale doesn't feel far off what it's like to use the Ace of Spades in-game, and at least for me, this is ultimately destined to be displayed on a shelf in my office, so the larger size ensures it won't be dwarfed by what's around it. And despite being big, it's not so heavy as to be uncomfortable; it's got a decent heft to it that prevents it from feeling flimsy, though you won't mistake it for being anything but plastic.</p><p dir="ltr">Visually, the Ace of Spades looks decidedly nicer than the Gjallarhorn in my estimation. Though you still aren't going to mistake it for any kind of real weapon, it eschews the shiny look of the Gjallarhorn's plastic that gave it an exceedingly kid's-toy-style appearance. Instead, it's got more of a matte finish, with decals that resemble the standard in-game version, albeit with a change in color scheme to a white-and-orange design. (An Exotic ornament is on the way soon that will allow you to match up the in-game gun with the Nerf version's look.)</p><p dir="ltr">It looks very nice overall, although your expectations should be set accordingly: This is a $50 Nerf gun that also packs a battery-operated firing mechanism, meaning the exterior is not that of a non-functional collectible costing hundreds of dollars. Some of the decals, possibly because of the textured surface, look slightly imperfect, though this only becomes noticeable when more closely examining it. The left side is adorned with a number of warnings and other icons that distract from the design, so it's best to keep the right side visible, though I wish the Destiny and Nerf logos there were relocated to keep it looking as sleek as possible. Fortunately, the accusation of a fan's design for the gun being used without permission has led to that fan, Tofu Bunny, being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-fan-accuses-bungie-of-stealing-their-design-for-new-nerf-gun/1100-6526438/">compensated and credited for their work</a>, so that brief drama seems to have worked out in the end, with Tofu Bunny saying they are "very grateful."</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374226" data-ratio="1.7777777777778" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374226"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades in hand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374226-aceofspadesinhand.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The batteries are used to fire the 12 darts--six per drum shell, with a second drum shell allowing you to quickly reload--and this is the other area that was a pleasant surprise. Not having used a Nerf gun in about two decades, and never one that relied on batteries, I was stunned by the force with which it fires. Whereas firing the Gjallarhorn was like shooting out a bunch of wet noodles, this packs much more of a punch than I expected. To fire, you first hold a trigger located under your middle finger, which revs the firing mechanism (and generates an audible whirring noise), before then pulling the main trigger to shoot.</p><p dir="ltr">This might very well be the norm for battery-powered Nerf guns, but I was pleased to see the long ranges the darts could travel. I expected them to gently make it across a room, when in fact they were moving quickly and going upwards of 40-50 feet, making for a much more fun experience than I had imagined. When I first fired it at a wall in my office from about seven feet away, I was taken aback by how far the darts bounced off the wall, sometimes even ending up behind me. It packs such a punch that the darts can bounce off multiple nearby surfaces, meaning they can be easily lost. Depending on how cluttered your room is, you'll need to be prepared to go dart-hunting, though the orange tips make doing so slightly easier.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, I had to know if these darts would hurt to be hit with, so I enlisted my wife, who was all too eager to take me up on the opportunity. She shot me twice from about 12 feet away, which was all it took to determine that, while it's not going to leave a mark, it is still unpleasant enough to insist the attacker cut it out immediately. On her way out, I couldn't resist returning the favor. My wife's review? "That shit <em>stings</em>," though it's only a "brief sting."</p><p dir="ltr">I expected the Ace of Spades to be a hit most of all with my cats, but so far they've been too alarmed--perhaps by the firing noise--to take part in hunting down the fired darts. That might be for the best, given any chewing on the darts seems like it could render them unable to smoothly fit into the drum shell, though my opportunity for a hit video in which my cats fly across the room after darts apparently isn't going to present itself.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other minor quibbles include the battery compartment (located on the left of the barrel, and which takes four AA batteries that aren't included) being somewhat difficult to open even after removing the screw. My lack of long fingernails meant I had to wedge in a small flathead screwdriver to lift up the cover, which briefly gave me flashbacks of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-dont-try-to-pry-your-destiny-2-the-final-shape-collectors-edition-open-like-me/1100-6522094/">mistakenly trying to pry apart the last Destiny collectible I got my hands on</a>. Thankfully, this time things worked out far better. There are also very small plastic dividers between the batteries, and I mistakenly bent one, preventing the batteries from making sufficient contact to function. That led me to firing the gun without battery power, which jammed the gun and made it difficult to get apart. Once I got the batteries properly seated, this was no longer an issue; you'll know you're good to fire when holding the rev trigger produces a noise. Pulling the hammer allows you to pop open the drum holder, but the drum slides right out if the gun is tilted backwards--good for reloading quickly, but potentially liable to it falling and hitting the ground. The drums are luckily sturdy enough that it doesn't feel as if they'll easily break, though.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374230" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374230"></a><figcaption>The Ace of Spades comes with two drum shells and 12 darts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374230-aceofspades.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4374231,1300-4374232,1300-4374233,1300-4374234,1300-4374235,1300-4374236,1300-4374237,1300-4374238,1300-4374239,1300-4374241,1300-4374242" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374231-ace1large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374232-ace2large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374233-ace3large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374234-ace4large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374235-ace5large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374236-ace6large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374237-ace7large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374238-ace8large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374239-ace9large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374241-ace10large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4374242-ace11large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As noted above, I don't know that I'll be firing the gun all that often long-term, but that's okay. It looks nice on a shelf, and coming off the campaign of The Final Shape--the best narrative work Bungie has done to date--I really like having this to commemorate Cayde-6, who famously wields the Ace of Spades. The initial reveal that Cayde would return to the game after being killed off years ago initially set off alarm bells, but his story turned out to be central to both the very character-focused plot of The Final Shape and its post-campaign content. Bungie somehow managed to pull off a worthwhile return for Cayde, and while his part might now truly be done, he will forever remain a major figure in the history of Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">Like many fans, the unfortunate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">layoffs at Bungie</a> have left me feeling uncertain about the series' future, even as the studio continues to share <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-new-raids-and-dungeons-are-seeing-big-changes-with-2025-dlc/1100-6526715/">more on what to expect</a>. But having this as a way to remember Cayde's part--and by association, many of my favorite moments over the last decade of Destiny--is a far more meaningful display piece to me than a more straightforward statue of a character. The fact that I might still get some cat videos out of it is just a nice bonus.</p><p>The Ace of Spades Nerf blasters was initially only available to preorder for those who unlocked the new Legend title in Destiny 2. It's now available for all to preorder on the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/bungie-rewards-nerf-ace-of-spades-blaster" rel="nofollow ">Bungie Store</a> and is expected to begin shipping in October.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Instead of weekly playlist rotations, players can expect only solo and quad playlists for standard battle royale on Urzikstan, and Resurgence maps are limited to duo and quads. This means the only way to play Warzone in trios is to play the competitive Ranked Play mode, which is getting a shorter timeframe for the final season. Season 6 of Ranked Play ends on October 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Raven Software didn't give a specific reason for the consolidation or why these exact playlists were chosen to be axed, but instead vaguely mentions that the change is related to making "preparations for the future of Warzone," and that more details will be shared in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the developer confirmed that Plunder, Bootcamp, and any active limited-time modes will remain available. Season 6 currently features a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-purgatory-ltm-cant-be-won-and-thats-why-its-great/1100-6526671/">really fun sandbox-style mode called Purgatory</a> that will be active in Warzone until October 16.</p><p dir="ltr">These limited playlist options will remain in Warzone until sometime later this year when the battle royale integrates with Season 1 of Black Ops 6. The first season of Black Ops 6 is set to introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/">new Area 99 Resurgence map</a> to Warzone, with Urzikstan remaining as the large map experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 arrives on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC. Make sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-6-release-date-and-details/1100-6526396/">all the big announcements for Black Ops 6</a>, including campaign details, round-based Zombies, and Treyarch's new omnimovement system.</p>

It's been a while since we heard anything substantial from Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest, the remake of long-defunct developer Adeline Software's much-loved 1994 action-adventure. But it's now returned in a flurry of news, bringing with it a new trailer, a limited-time Steam demo, and a 14th November release date on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Little Big Adventure (for those of you too young/previously indisposed to remember) tells the story of Twinsen - a model citizen turned fugitive overnight - as he attempts to escape evil dictator Dr. FunFrock. It offers a compelling mix of platforming, puzzling, and exploration that, 30 years later, has had a thorough makeover in Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest.
</p>
<p>
Twinsen's Quest developer 2.21, which was founded by Little Big Adventure co-creator Didier Chanfray, announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/90s-cult-classic-little-big-adventure-is-set-to-make-a-return-in-new-game">bunch of ambitious plans</a> for the series back in 2021, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-big-adventure-1-2-get-cloud-saves-controller-support-and-more-in-new-update">updated remasters</a>, a remake, and even a (seemingly stalled) new entry. To date, the studio has released remasters of Little Big Adventure 1 &amp; 2, and its remake is now due before the end of the year.

<p>
Alongside a gently refreshed (and rather lovely) visual style, Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest features an open world of reimagined islands, an enhanced version of Twinsen's Magic Ball weapon, redesigned controls, and a new soundtrack by original composer Philippe Vachey. There's a little more insight into its creation in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bncH6u3o5Bk">making-of video</a> published alongside its release date news. And if that's still not enough Little Big Adventure for you, a limited-time Twinsen's Quest demo featuring the remake's first chapter is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3021340/Little_Big_Adventure__Twinsens_Quest_Demo/">now available on Steam</a>. You'll need to be quick, however - it's only sticking around until 2nd October. 
</p>
<p>
Little Big Adventure: Twinsen's Quest launches digitally for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318070/Little_Big_Adventure__Twinsens_Quest/">Steam</a>, GOG, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/twinsens-little-big-adventure-remastered-1c39bb">Epic</a>) on 14th November. A limited edition physical release for PS5 and Switch arrives on 5th December.

So far, season two looks like a pretty faithful adaptation of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. But even in the short, two-minute teaser, it seems like HBO is taking a few creative liberties with the source material. So we figured we’d go shot by shot and break down the trailer, the ways it’s adapting the events of <em>Part II</em>, and try and suss out some of the new scenes that weren’t included in the game. Open up your music streaming service of choice, put on Pearl Jam’s “Future Days,” and read on.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-recommend-id="image://7a500d2b3e34935936033d81d325d55a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherine O'Hara turns on a timer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As we saw in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-trailer-hbo-max-joel-ellie-abby-1851613343">the first trailer</a></span>, it looks like Joel is going to therapy in season two. <em>Schitt’s Creek</em>’s Catherine O’Hara is playing Joel’s therapist, and we see her get a bit snippy with Pedro Pascal’s “sad dad.” She puts on a timer and asks if he “wants to start, or what?” I imagine Joel is not too thrilled at the idea of going to a therapist, and might be coming into these sessions rather guarded, so O’Hara’s character is likely unhappy with his dismissive attitude. </p><p>This scene does appear to be a kind of stand-in for the opening of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> in which Joel confesses to his brother Tommy that he murdered dozens of Firefly radicals who were planning to kill Ellie to create a vaccine for the cordyceps fungus ruining the world. Does doctor/patient confidentiality apply to something of that magnitude?<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-recommend-id="image://0847cc0d5ae518ff4e941c71cc4633c8" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie walks through Jackson." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Next we see a shot of Ellie walking through the snowy streets of Jackson, Wyoming. Joel and Ellie returned to this settlement after the events of the season finale. The small town is led by Joel’s sister-in-law Maria and sustains a decent population with good quality of life for the post-apocalypse. We also get a shot of Joel’s mailbox with “Miller” on the side of it. It’s all very idyllic. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-recommend-id="image://a85665c1ed157d5ca1e36a64a4a111f2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel picks up the guitar and Ellie plays it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of idyllic, Joel gifts Ellie an orange-brown sunburst acoustic guitar with a moth design on the fretboard. He did promise to teach her how to play, after all. The trailer plays Pearl Jam’s “Future Days” over the scene, but it’s unclear right now if that’s the song Joel will play for her when he gives her the guitar as he did in the game. <em>The Last of Us </em>show begins in 2003, rather than 2013 as the game did. So that song technically wouldn’t have been around then, as Pearl Jam released it in 2013. Ellie could learn a different song, or the show might just say “fuck it” and keep it in there anyway. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-recommend-id="image://5307552b640f91fc161c008728e31223" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie plays guitar as Dina sits down in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Whether she learns “Future Days” or something else, Ellie starts learning how to play guitar thanks to Joel.

Most of what we see in this trailer looks like scenes that would fit neatly in the first half, but there’s a moment that seems a bit out of place. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> is structured around multiple flashbacks, and the final one is a conversation between Joel and Ellie on his back porch. There’s a scene in here that sure looks like the beginning of that one, in which Joel is playing his guitar and stops when he sees Ellie, though from a distance. If this scene is in season two, it could mean a lot for the thematic thrust of <em>Part II</em>’s story, but we’ll see if this is a fake out soon enough.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-recommend-id="image://88e630a9840d01f7bc7a3692d7ba5ba9" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jesse puts something on the ground and looks at Tommy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next, we get our first look at Young Mazino as Jesse.

The Sepharites are characterized in-game by the scars around their mouths and bulky trench coats, and they’ve got the same look in this trailer. We see a Seraphite man walking through a forest and Ellie looking at some of their graffiti in the city. It reads “FEEL HER LOVE,” referencing their prophet who was killed by the militaristic Washington Liberation Front.

But you’ll see how all that bubbles over in 2025 when season two premieres on Max.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today and we will continue to create not only games but also entertainment content."</p><p>Miyamoto's comments are candid, but also not a massive shock considering Nintendo has largely been left out of the console war conversation, at least in comparison to Sony and Microsoft. Those two companies have continued to focus on high specs and performance in particular, with Sony recently announcing the pricey <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024">PS5 Pro</a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Nintendo will continue to make products that are uniquely Nintendo using various technologies available in the world today."</p></div><p>And it's not like the approach hasn't been working for Nintendo, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-switch-2-waiting-in-the-wings-nintendo-believes-the-og-switch-has-plenty-of-sales-left-in-it">Switch still selling well</a> even as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today">its successor waits in the wings</a>. </p><p>These comments are only the latest from Miyamoto to make headlines, with the video game icon recently saying Nintendo <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shigeru-miyamoto-on-ai-nintendo-would-rather-go-in-a-different-direction">would rather go in a "different direction"</a> from some of its industry peers when it comes to the subject of AI. </p><p><em>Thumbnail credit: Amy Sussman/Getty Images</em></p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p dir="ltr">California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240ab2426" rel="nofollow ">AB 2426</a>, to address concerns over "disappearing" purchases of digital media, including games, movies, music, and ebooks. The law mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than indicating actual ownership, as reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Effective next year, the legislation prohibits digital retailers from using terms like "buy" or "purchase" unless they clearly state that customers do not receive unrestricted access. Retailers must disclose that these licenses can be revoked and provide a list of associated restrictions. Companies that fail to comply may face fines for false advertising.</p><p dir="ltr">This law emerges as digital game sales surge and subscription models dominate the industry, prompting questions about ownership. The gaming community is increasingly aware that titles may not be accessible in the future. An episode of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/should-we-give-up-on-owning-games-spot-on/1100-6520479/">Spot On</a> earlier this year discussed a hypothetical scenario in which, wanting to revisit a game like Alan Wake 2 in 2045, players could find it unavailable due to the shift away from physical sales.</p><p dir="ltr">The legislation responds to practices by major companies like PlayStation and Ubisoft. Earlier this year, Ubisoft removed The Crew from player accounts after shutting down its servers, while last year, Sony indicated it would remove purchased content from users' libraries before reversing that decision.</p><p dir="ltr">"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," said California Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin <a href="https://a42.asmdc.org/press-releases/20240916-assemblymember-irwin-urges-governor-sign-legislation-increasing" rel="nofollow ">in a press release</a>. "AB 2426 will ensure the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."</p><p dir="ltr">While the law raises awareness about the limitations of digital licenses, it does not prevent storefronts from revoking access to purchased content. This legislation reflects ongoing efforts to clarify the nature of digital acquisitions and the evolving landscape of media ownership.</p>

		<p>Jackbox Games has announced The Jackbox Survey Scramble, a second smaller collection of games that will put survey-based games to the fore when it launches in late October.</p>
<p>The game will arrive for all major platforms including PC, Mac, Linux, Playstation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, and will be priced at the rather appealing point of $9.99. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/">A free demo</a> will be available during Steam Next Fest from 14th-21st October.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Survey Scramble | Announcement Trailer (EN)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPqck0NjkPs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The immediate comparison that many have already drawn is to Guesspionage, one of the minigames from Jackbox Party Pack 3, which used survey data to populate the answers to its many questions. However, Jackbox Survey Scramble is, at the very least, that idea on steroids. The good steroids.</p>
<p>Jackbox Survey Scramble will feature four game modes, and with more game modes added in a free up date before the end of the year. Initially these will include Hilo, where you guess the most and least popular answers, Speed mode, where you’re guessing against the clock, Squares, where you organise choices in popularity order, and a mode where you can intercept your opponents answers in Bounce.</p>

<p>In each case, the survey data that the game is drawing from is dynamically shifting based on the answers that you and all of the game’s players are feeding into it. Come back to the game a week, a month, a year later and the same prompts will potentially give rather different answers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Off the back of the recently released Jackbox Naughty Pack, Jackbox is making this a game with broader settings. One of the question examples is “what’s the cutest word for a butt?” but that won’t be in there if you apply content filters for a lower age range. There’s also streamer settings and accessibility options aplenty.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking Naughty Pack, this is the first year in a decade without a 5-game Party Pack release, and Naughty Pack didn’t manage to fill that void for us in anywhere near the same way. An experimental fumble in the dark which sought to put more adult-rated prompts and games together, it did not land. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/18/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-review/">Naughty Pack review</a>, Jason said, “Ultimately, Jackbox Naughty Pack is the worst Party Pack to date, […] Maybe making our own fun and our own filth is the way forwards to a truly naughty experience.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s hoping that Survey Scramble can right the good ship Jackbox.</p>

Hardware leaker Kopite7kimi has <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1839343725727941060">published rumored specifications</a> for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 today, and both cards will reportedly be more power-hungry as Nvidia looks to debut more capable next-gen GPUs.</p><p>The RTX 5090 is said to have a 600-watt spec, although as <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-specs-leaked"><em>VideoCardz </em>points out</a> it’s not clear if this refers to how much the entire GPU board draws, or how much power the chip itself consumes. Either way, it looks like the RTX 5090 will draw 150 watts more than the 450 watts that the RTX 4090 pulls. The RTX 5090 will also reportedly include 32GB of GDDR7 memory on a 512-bit bus, with 21,760 CUDA cores.</p><p>Similarly, the RTX 5080 is said to use 400 watts of power, up from the RTX 4080’s 320-watt total graphics power. The RTX 5080 will <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1839345147789934794">also reportedly ship</a> with 16GB of GDDR7 memory and a 256-bit memory bus, with 10,752 CUDA cores.</p><p>Kopite7kimi has leaked a variety of GPU information over the years and has a reliable track record for Nvidia hardware leaks. Kopite7kimi previously revealed the specifications of the <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1430716119367622660">RTX 3090</a> and RTX 3080 cards ahead of their launch, the launch dates of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950348/nvidia-rtx-4080-4070-super-ces-2024-launch-rumor">RTX 4070 / RTX 4080 Super cards</a>, and the return of the 12GB RTX 4080 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446875/nvidia-rtx-4080-12gb-return-rtx-4070-ti-rumor">as the RTX 4070 Ti</a>. They also correctly predicted the RTX 4090 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23076656/nvidia-rtx-4090-rumor-release-july-2022">would require</a> 450 watts of power.</p><p>While the specs for Nvidia’s top RTX 50-series cards may have been leaked already, dates for when we’ll see these cards have not been shared. I understand from one source familiar with Nvidia’s plans that we might hear more about the RTX 50-series at the Consumer Electronics Show in early 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The mobile game—which featured hundreds of characters, quests, events, dialogue written by Simpsons writers, and let players re-build Springfield—will be removed from app stores on October 31. EA has turned off in-app purchases already. The game will remain playable until January 24, 2025. After that, servers for <em>Tapped Out</em> will be turned off and the game will no longer be playable. </p><p>“The decision to end our twelve-year journey is an emotional one,” posted EA on the official <em>Tapped Out </em>Facebook page. “Together with our partners at <em>The Simpsons</em> and The Walt Disney Company, we have delighted in bringing this game to you, the fans, and seeing how you’ve each built your own beloved versions of Springfield. It has been a remarkable journey, and we are grateful that we’ve been able to deliver 308 updates, 831 characters and including today’s final farewell 1,463 questlines.”</p><p>Personally, I’m sad to see <em>Tapped Out </em>go away. I’ve been playing the game for over a decade now and have enjoyed returning to it every few months or so to check out new events, spend a few bucks on some silly new characters, and enjoy all the Halloween fun each other October. </p><p>While <em>The Simpsons Tapped</em> Out is over a decade old at this point, it’s still the newest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544?_gl=1*1no0fls*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NTcwMC40Mi4xLjE3MjczNzUzMDkuOS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-simpsons-best-episodes-characters-top-to-watch-list-1850309544?_gl=1*1no0fls*_ga*MjAxMTA0MDE1Ny4xNzI1Njc1NzAy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzM2NTcwMC40Mi4xLjE3MjczNzUzMDkuOS4wLjA."><em>Simpsons</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>game available right now.

Throughout the coming weeks, we will be returning as much content from the past twelve years as possible, in waves of a few years of releases at a time. Look for these in the store! This includes both Premium and Prize items. Waves of items will be released on a weekly cadence for the next five weeks.</p><p><strong>Q: What about land and item limits?</strong><br>A: As part of the previous event, A Bart Future, we phased in increased land tile availability, along with ramped-up item placement limits. While we are not adding any additional increases with Taps, there will be a reference to it within the final questline, as we did not formally announce this enhancement<br>previously.</p><p><strong>New Items:</strong><br>There are new items coming to the store as part of the final wave of Taps store items – a building and a bunch of decorations, that were not previously released.

Note that some Switch games offered by Woot are region-free imports--so while the ratings board logo on the box might look different, they’ll still run just fine on your console and function as if you bought them at your local retailer. Woot doesn't explicitly state which games are imports, but as long as that possibility doesn't bother you, you can get some Switch games for their lowest prices yet with Prime shipping.</p><hr><h2>Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Woot</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> -- $45 ($<del>70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fthe-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_56&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> -- $40 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fpaper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-4%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_17&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13112648%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-rpg-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_3&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario RPG</a> -- $32 ($<del>50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fluigis-mansion-2-hd-7%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luigi's Mansion 2</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fprincess-peach-showtime-8%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_6&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Princess Peach: Showtime</a> -- $45 ($<del>60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13112648%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsuper-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_9&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-exclusives-get-huge-limited-time-discounts-including-zelda-and-mario-games%2F1100-6526741%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Ddlvr.it%26utm_medium%3Dtwitter&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros.

This game isn’t for the faint of heart however, as it is filled with intentional friction. I think that friction is part of what makes <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> so special, as it makes the world feel even more alive and believable, but many won’t be happy with things like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-fast-travel-hobbit-delicious-in-dungeon-1851370156&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-fast-travel-hobbit-delicious-in-dungeon-1851370156">lack of fast travel</a></span> or the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-dragonsplague-pawn-illness-reddit-1851363471#:~:text=What%20do%20I%20mean%20here,kill%20everyone%20in%20the%20area.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-game-dragonsplague-pawn-illness-reddit-1851363471#:~:text=What%20do%20I%20mean%20here,kill%20everyone%20in%20the%20area.">in-game plague</a></span> that can kill party members.
