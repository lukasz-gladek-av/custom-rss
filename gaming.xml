<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a> is one of the six games up for the grand prize, and before the ceremony can get underway, developer Supergiant Games has shared a heartwarming piece of artwork, congratulating its fellow nominees.</p>
<p>The art depicts the main character from each of the six games (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/kingdom_come_deliverance_ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</a> and, of course, Hades II) dressed in their finest award ceremony attire and gracing the red carpet.

<p>"We’re deeply honored that HADES II is in the running for Game of the Year and more at #TheGameAwards tonight," the Supergiant message accompanying the art reads, "especially since we’re in the company of such an amazing group of wildly different and beautiful games. Congratulations to all our fellow nominees — we salute you!!"</p>

<p>Clair Obscur is the big favourite to take home the grand prize tonight (and every other award, it seems), but we'd be happy to see just about any finalist walk away with the win.

              <p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards enters its 12th year</a>, it’s worth looking back on some of the highs and lows from TGAs past. Out of the ashes of the Spike VGAs, creator and host Geoff Keighley created an annual gaming staple that highlights some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">biggest and best games for millions watching from home</a>. It honors creators and brands, seeking to elevate the craft and art of games while also leaving room for giant walking razor blade sponsorships. Here are 17 of the best and worst Game Awards moments going back to 2014.</p> <h2>“Fuck The Oscars!” – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Any list of iconic or famous Game Awards moments must legally include what is arguably the show’s most well-known clip: That time <em>Split Ficition</em> and<em> It Takes Two</em> director Josef Fares took control of the show for a few minutes and yelled “Fuck the Oscars!” in front of a visibly confused Geoff. Great stuff. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2><em>Ark 2</em> starring Vin Diesel is announced – The Game Awards 2020</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vin-diesel-is-fighting-dinosaurs-in-ark-2-1845856293">It was funny when Wildcard Studios announced an <em>Ark</em> sequel</a> despite many fans at the time feeling the original game needed more updates. It was even funnier when Vin Diesel appeared in the trailer. And it’s really, really funny that five years later, the game appears to be vaporware and has yet to launch. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/almost-5-years-since-its-reveal-ark-2-devs-admit-the-survival-sequel-was-put-on-hold-a-couple-of-years-ago-but-theyre-hopeful-it-could-release-in-early-access-within-the-next-2-years/">But it might finally see the light of day in 2027.</a> – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>The leaders of the three console companies share a stage – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>The Game Awards foreshadowed the end of the console wars when Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé, Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and PlayStation’s Shawn Layden took the stage together at the 2018 ceremony to look beyond old marketing rivalries, exclusivity deals, and platform competition and praise gaming as a medium that transcends studio borders and corporate branding. Two of them are now retired and only Spencer remains at his post, currently overseeing the implementation of a similar philosophy as Microsoft goes multiplatform. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>DrDisrespect wins the Trending Gamer award – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm was crowned the biggest gamer of 2017 back when the Game Awards and the traditional gaming industry was still much more intertwined with the growing creator economy on YouTube and Twitch. Little did we all know that this was the same year in which Beahm would later <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">admit to having had</a> “casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate” with a female minor. He was later banned from Twitch over it, even though the full incident wouldn’t come to light until 2024. Presciently, the Game Awards never did another Trending Gamer prize again. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Ken &amp; Roberta Williams win the first Industry Icons Award – The Game Awards 2014</h2>  <p>The very first Game Awards in 2014 was an overly long and very boring show. But even I had to smile when Ken and Roberta Williams, two very important video game pioneers, were given the Industry Icon award. This show should have tons of these kinds of moments; alas, these segments that truly celebrate creators and games are still far too rare. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Ninja showing up – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>In an attempt to professionalize the category, the Game Awards shifted from 2017’s Trending Gamer to “Content Creator of the Year.” While Richard “Ninja” Blevins would go on to win it in 2018, he also just appeared during the show at the height of his electric-blue-haired popularity for a bit with a Muppet that may have been one of the least funny bits to ever appear during the show’s decade-plus run. Ninja may have had the charisma of a plastic “forkknife” but the writers did him no favors here. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Flute Guy – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>Live concerts have always been a staple of the Game Awards, but they’ve gotten much better with the move away from <em>Rock Band</em>-like cameos and toward orchestral arrangements of actual video game music. No one embodies that more than Venezuelan flautist Pedro Eustache, who became a viral sensation for his passionate and expressive performances across a variety of different instruments at the 2022 show, especially during the <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> segment. He’s so good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sb27LA2n8w">they keep bringing him back</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Rock Band VR</em> announcement trailer – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>I’m not sure why <em>Rock Band VR</em> was even created or why it was given such a lengthy spotlight at the Game Awards. And perhaps the worst part is that if you watched the show live or were there in person, you had to look at Palmer Luckey’s feet. The VR wunderkind is now a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tech-ceo-shares-how-he-early-supporter-trump-running-president-before-his-2016-campaign">right-wing</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palmer-luckey-ai-powered-autonomous-weapons-future-of-warfare-60-minutes-transcript/">AI weapons dealer</a>, and it makes this already hard-to-watch segment even more unbearable. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Waldorf and Statler dunk on the event – The Game Awards 2024</h2>  <p>Yes, it’s a bit odd how often Geoff invites Muppets to the Game Awards. But whatever, I don’t care because it means Statler and Waldorf got to occasionally appear and make fun of the show, Geoff, and everything else. It was wonderful. Truly inspired. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Schick Hyrdobot takes it to the next level – The Game Awards 2016</h2>  <p>The early days of the Game Awards are filled with some truly bizarre sponsorship moments and deals. Geoff needed help funding this thing and seemed willing to take any deal he was offered. That is likely how we ended up with Schick Hyrdobot, a horrific razor-robot-man hybrid that appeared periodically throughout the&nbsp; 2016 event. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Fans boo Konami – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>Number one Keighley best friend Hideo Kojima was not allowed to attend the 2015 show. In an uncharacteristically candid segment, Geoff outlined that Konami’s lawyers were specifically prohibiting the <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> director from attending despite the game being nominated. “It’s unfathomable to me,” the host said. As the audience booed the publisher, the show commemorated the absence with a special performance of “Quiet Steam” from the game. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Cutting the GOTY speech short – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p>Larian Studios took home the top prize for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>at the 2023 show but director Swen Vincke only had 60 seconds to speedrun through the team’s acceptance speech. Things were made even worse by a “<a href="https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732975428237934964%7Ctwgr%5Ef68fd0afd04e064cfcb2ee0dbe53a48fa90d90b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fbaldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">wrap it up</a>” sign that happened to flash right when he was mentioning the colleagues that had been lost along the way during development. Fortunately, the studio head shared <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">his full speech online</a> after the show, and went on to have one of the best monologues at the following year’s show, in which he predicted <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-awards-goty-larian-1851780699">potentially sweeping this year’s awards</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aime remembers Iwata – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>As mentioned already, it’s rare that the Game Awards takes a moment to truly slow down and let someone be human. That makes this moment in 2015 when Geoff and then-Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé eulogized and honored the recently passed Satuoru Iwata, all the more special. Geoff literally says that for the next few minutes he’s putting away the trailers, the awards, and the marketing, and seems truly affected by Iwata’s death. Turns out you don’t need big flashy trailers to create a memorable moment. Just some heart. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel end the show awkwardly – The Game Awards 2019</h2>  <p>I think the 2019 Game Awards have the worst and strangest ending in the show’s history. It starts with Michelle Rodriguez revealing the last game of the show, a crappy <em>Fast and Furious</em> game that looked terrible, and evolves into an awkward back-and-forth between her and Vin Diesel about the next <em>F&amp;F</em> movie and video games. It’s rough stuff. Worse, the two were then involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/UOmdhofNzDM">handing out the final award of the night to the Game of the Year winner.</a> Yikes! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Christopher Judge wins and gives a nine-minute speech – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>There’s no <em>God of War</em> reboot without Christopher Judge, and the <em>Stargate</em> veteran went on to win “Best Performance” for <em>Ragnarök</em> in 2022. He gave what must be the longest speech in Game Awards history. It was personal, emotional, and so drawn out that Keighley spent the next few years rushing winners off the stage after 30 seconds to stop the show from going too late into the night. But he earned it after punctuating the 2018 show with the best three words anyone spoke onstage that night: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgaD_0LboI">Read it, boy</a>.” – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Bill Clinton kid crashes the stage – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-infowars-blizzcon-troll-1849877331">Small-time online troll</a> Matan Even snuck on stage at the end of the 2022 ceremony when <em>Elden Ring</em> was crowned Game of the Year. It was confusing and absurd. “I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton,” he said after speeches from the actual developers. The incident’s legacy as the most “this thing is happening live” moment in TGA history was only trumped by just how dumb it turned out to be. Keighley has tightened security in the years since. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Alan Wake 2</em> dance – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Recreating the best moment from </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Alan Wake 2</a>,</em> one of the best games of 2023, live on stage was such a brilliant and fun idea that I almost believe Geoff wasn’t involved in that meeting. However this came about, I don’t care, because the end result is <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">arguably the most joyful moment in the history of the Game Awards</a>. More of this and honoring creators, and less random celebrities and bad jokes, please! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  People who bet on AI being <i>Time Magazine</i>'s Person of the Year and lost money are very mad right now
                </p><div>
              
              <p><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its Person of the Year for 2025. It wasn’t one person, but many different people who are all at the helm of pushing AI technology. This has caused some prediction market gamblers who had bet on AI itself earning the distinction to start yelling a lot online. It’s very funny, but also a horrible glimpse at our bet-on-everything future.</p>

 <p>On December 11, <a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/"><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its annual Person of the Year cover</a>. The long-running magazine, whose readership at this point is made up mostly of bored people in waiting rooms, revealed that there wasn’t just one person of the year in 2025, but seven different individuals. <em>Time Magazine</em> refers to these people as the “Architects of AI,” and they include names like Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, and OpenAI boss Sam Altman. Normally, I’d think about who <em>Time</em> picked as the Person of the Year for about 10 seconds and then move on with my life. But this time, who they picked, and the <a href="https://time.com/7339703/ai-architects-person-of-the-year-2025/">use of two different covers,</a> have caused chaos among people who love to bet on everything.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was the year when artificial intelligence’s full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back.</p> <p>For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the… <a href="https://t.co/mEIKRiZfLo">pic.twitter.com/mEIKRiZfLo</a></p> <p>— TIME (@TIME) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1999097617633189955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On the prediction market website Kalshi, <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxtime/times-person-of-the-year/kxtime-25">nearly $20 million worth of betting</a> happened over who would be <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year. One popular option that many bet on was AI. So when Kalshi called the bet and listed the specific people the magazine had named as the “Architects of AI” as the winners, but not AI itself, a lot of people were angry. They believed that AI was also the winner as it was named directly. Making things more confusing, <em>Time Magazine</em> ran two covers for the Person of the Year issue this year, one featuring the architects, with the other featuring “AI” in massive letters, though the words “The Architects of AI” are still present in the cover’s corner. Still, this cover is more evidence, according to those who bet on AI, that it, too, should be considered a winning outcome in one of the site’s biggest bets of the year.</p>

 <p>“ITS THE ARCHITECTS OF AI THISNIS LITTERALY THE BET FUCK KALSHI,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/9914a9da-54dc-4447-b104-825713e9dff4">posted one angry gambler</a> who bet on AI and lost. “This is actually so freaking stupid,” said <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/0deb1354-478d-4bca-8538-c6e4ce282413">another user</a>.</p> <p>“This pretty clearly should’ve resolved to yes,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/601174f7-f82e-484a-8955-e3e68fd75032">said another upset AI better</a>. “If you bought AI, reach out to Kalshi support because ‘AI’ is literally on the cover and in the title, ‘Architects of AI.’ They’re not going to change anything unless they hear from people.”</p>

 <p>“The cover literally says ‘AI” right on the front. This is insane,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/151a0fb2-e8ef-4964-96ed-5627f7cf1820">said another upset gambler.</a> “fr bro we got screwed,” replied someone else.</p> <p>While I am definitely laughing at how many people lost money betting on <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year, I’m also aware that this is our future. This bet-on-everything shit is growing quickly. Sites like Kalshi and Polymarket are letting people gamble on literally anything. And this is just the start. <a href="https://kotaku.com/finance-bro-thinks-it-would-be-cool-to-turn-your-entire-life-into-the-stock-market-2000650201">The CEO of Kalshi recently explained</a> that he wants to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion.” In other words, every part of our humanity<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->what we love, believe in, cherish, hope for, fear, etc.<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the near future will be something to bet on. That’s only going to make it easier for the <a href="https://pausebeforeyouplay.org/2025/06/online-gambling-is-likely-on-the-rise-at-a-high-school-near-you/">growing number of young people addicted to online gambling</a> to lose even more money. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/volodymyr-zelensky-suit-polymarket-rebellion/">And the arbiters of how these bets are settled and who wins will be tech bros</a>.</p> <p>Good luck, everyone. I place our odds of making it through the AI-powered online gambling future ahead of us pretty low. I’m not taking that bet.</p>

                <p>The recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-big-new-update-with-michael-dlc-mission-is-out-now-see-the-full-patch-notes/1100-6536845/" data-ref-id="1100-6536845">A Safehouse in the Hills</a> update for GTA Online may contain clues about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, or at least that's what the franchise's passionate fanbase is theorizing based on some recent discoveries.</p><p>After the big new update went live on December 10, people dug into the game's code in search of anything that might provide clues about GTA 6, and people think they found some. A <a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1999140552722280655" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">line of text that was discovered</a> references a voice line for the character Jimmy, the son of main character Michael, that says he is "moving out of state." Another line, from his mother Amanda, says, "Our son is finally moving away from home." People are taking this to suggest that Jimmy may have moved to Leonida, the stand-in for GTA 6's setting of Florida, but that's just conjecture for now.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA Online: A Safehouse In The Hills - Update Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Dataminers also discovered that the <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/KnoWay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KnoWay</a> autonomous driving company that was added to GTA Online in the new update was formerly known as <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Sahara" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sahara</a>. That is the name of a delivery and logistics company for GTA 6, as seen in previously released GTA 6 screenshots. The dataminer, Tex2, theorized that Rockstar might have at one point planned a Part 2 for the A Safehouse in the Hills expansion to be timed with GTA 6's previous release date of May 2026 prior to the game's delay to November 2026.</p><p>With Rockstar providing so little concrete information about GTA 6, people have been hunting for years for any morsels of possible clues about GTA 6, and this is just the latest example. The game's first trailer was released two years ago this month. A second trailer arrived in May 2025, but the company has said said anything more about the game since then, apart from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">confirming the delay to November 2026 in early November.</a></p><p>Rockstar said it delayed GTA 6 yet again as part of an effort to ensure the game is up to the company's high quality standards.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, "When we set a date, we really do believe in it. We said when we set the last date, if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time. And that's exactly what happened."</p><p>He added: "We feel really good about this release date. It's in the same fiscal year, it happens to be a great release window, and naturally we're really supportive of Rockstar's approach."</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to market with an enormous amount of hype behind it. One expert has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-ref-id="1100-6521839">GTA 6 is the single most important game release in history.</a> It's the first new entry in the series since 2013's GTA 5 and is predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell more than 40 million units in its first year alone.</a></p><p>Another talking point regarding GTA 6 has been what its price point could be. One industry observer has said there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"hope"</a> from some that GTA 6 would come to market at $100 to help give other publishers a reason to raise prices as well. A GTA 5 actor recently said GTA 6 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-warrants-a-100-price-tag-gta-5-actor-says/1100-6535876/" data-ref-id="1100-6535876">well worth $100 given the game's size and scope.</a></p><p>Developer Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize. The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">"look into" the firings.</a></p><p>For more on GTA Online's new update, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-big-new-update-with-michael-dlc-mission-is-out-now-see-the-full-patch-notes/1100-6536845/" data-ref-id="1100-6536845">see the full patch notes</a> and read about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-the-michael-mission-in-gta-online-safehouse-in-the-hills-update/1100-6536842/" data-ref-id="1100-6536842">how to start the new mission starring Michael.</a></p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The next expansion heading for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> has been revealed, and it has some very familiar faces front and centre.</p>
<p>The Crimson Blaze set launches on <strong>17th December</strong>, and sees Mega Charizard Y plastered across the packet cover. Naturally, new cards for Mega Venusaur and Mega Blastoise are included too, alongside new art for the Kanto starters and fresh card covers/backdrops.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives us a pretty good idea of what the set will have in store, but here's a closer look at a handful of the new cards:</p>


<p>The last set to arrive in the app was October's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-new-expansion-as-app-surpasses-150-million-downloads">Mega Rising expansion</a>, which ushered a new range of risky Mega Evolutions into the card battler. It'll be interesting to see how long these Mega cards stay in play as new sets keep rolling out in 2026.</p>

<p>Time is ticking down until Geoff Keighley once again emerges from his fleshy cocoon, brushes the Garibaldi crumbs from his suit, and strides onto the stage to bellow his customary challenge of "Who wants some?". We assume he means games, but one day he will nut a developer in the front row and we won't be able to say he didn't warn us.</p>
<p>We're pulling together a quick rundown of everything announced at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a> so you don't need to risk life and limb by straying too close to Geoff's grasping fingers.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're planning on staying up for the night, then a fine time shall be had by all who pull up a stool at James's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">The Game Awards 2025 liveblog</a>. If, however you'd rather not trade a good night's sleep for an early look at trailers, then head back here tomorrow morning for a full list of everything announced at the show.</p>
<p>For the games we find most intriguing, we will be writing fuller stories which I'll link out to below.</p>
<p>What's that? The Game Awards haven't started yet? You could have fooled me, what with all the…</p>
<h2>Confirmed games at The Game Awards 2025</h2>
<h3>Total War: Mystery</h3>
<p>Those cheeky so and sos over at Creative Assembly held a livestream last week, a right poke in the eye for ol' Geoff. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creative-assembly-reveal-total-war-medieval-3-while-teasing-a-huge-game-reveal-to-follow">It's where they announced Total War: Medieval 3</a> (while also puncturing the excitement by saying it was still years from release). However, to salve Geoff's bloodshot eye, they also teased a big announcement for The Game Awards.</p><p>There have long been rumours of a Total War take on either Star Wars or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-reveal-likely-after-telltale-words-40k-spotted-in-creative-assembly-video">Warhammer 40k</a>. That could well live up to Creative Assembly's promise that "this title will be Total War's next major release and represents one of the most ambitious projects in the franchise's history, marking the beginning of an exciting new era."</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest in June, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth main game in the series. Capcom had insisted that it wouldn't star Leon and would instead focus on new character technical analyst Grace Ashcroft. However, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leon-kennedys-in-resident-evil-requiem-playstation-store-cover-art-leak-confirms">a leaked cover from earlier this week</a> certainly appeared to show everyone's favourite cop-turned-super-soldier, suggesting that Capcom's pants are a-blazing.</p>
<h3>New Tomb Raider</h3>
<p>Like a Roman emperor tossing another prisoner to the lions in the colosseum, <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1998093056692895923">on Monday Geoff threw out a tweet teasing "a look at the future" for Tomb Raider</a>. Out in the world with all that hungry attention on it, someone quickly found the box art and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-the-next-tomb-raider-reboot-project-going-by-alleged-trailer-leak">reveal trailer for Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a>. The trailer was taken down, but reports from those that saw it say it looks like a reboot for the series.</p>
<p>Confirmed game news is all well and good, but what about the more salacious stuff? The grimy things no one wants to stand by ahead of the night? You know what I mean…</p>
<h2>The Game Awards 2025 rumours</h2>
<p>Well, one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming is the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake. It looks like it may be ready to eagle dive from the crow's nest with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">a PEGI rating for Assassins's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a> spotted just the other day. Presumably it's too late to rename the project? Something a little less of a mouthful would be lovely.</p><p>Being a Keighley show, Hideo Kojima is often lurking in the wings. With a recent ESRB rating for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach PC release, tonight could be the moment for an on-stage reveal. Maybe with some added director's cut gubbins thrown in?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is likely to win big at the awards tonight, so it would also be the perfect time for the team to reveal their next project. Be it details of an expansion of a tease of something more.</p>
<p>Now, finally, as long as I've been a games journalist, I've been hearing rumours of the imminent reveal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a>. Once again, with the advent of the Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and new Steam Controller, there's been more buzz about Gordon Freeman once again picking up his crowbar. I want it to be true, but I have no reason to believe it is true. Nor that Valve would announce it anywhere other than their own show. That said, I'm not going to say I'll eat my hat if it's announced, because under everything I remain an optimist.</p>
<p>I'll be updating this post throughout the night and, if all goes to plan, when you wake up tomorrow it will be chock full of trailers and game reveals. If not, well, let us salute my attempt.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-budget-wireless-headphones-just-got-even-cheaper-with-a-nearly-50-priced-like-no-brand-wired-earbuds-2000652308</link>
            <guid>1379911</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The market is overflowing with headphones, but does that mean every other option out there is worth your money? Not at all. Those on a budget looking to grab a solid pair – we come bearing good news.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">Amazon just slashed the Sony WH-CH520 wireless headphones by 46%, bringing the price down to just $38</a>. You’re saving $32 on a pair that not only gets you premium, high-quality sound but also offers an incredible battery life. All color options are discounted, so there’s plenty to choose from. Prefer your audio gear minimal? Go for the stunning blue version. Those who want their headphones to have a bit of a personality can consider the pink or yellow options! The retailer is also throwing in a two-month trial to Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Sound Experience</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on looks-wise, which is a good thing. The lightweight build features an adjustable headband, paired with swivel earcups that slip on and off gently. The ear pads are soft, plus they come with an additional head cushion and silent joints, making it easy to wear these headphones for an extended period of time. You’ll be able to survive those never-ending commutes, plus boring tasks that otherwise feel unbearable.</p>
<p>Everyone has different sound preferences, and this pair takes care of that. It pushes high-quality, rich audio, but you can further customize the listening experience by tailoring it according to your taste using the EQ Custom feature on the Sony Headphones Connect app. The platform lets you pick from a wide range of presets to match the quality of the sound to what’s playing. Go for a deeper bass for energy-filled tracks, and tone it down when something a bit calmer plays. DSEE support makes it easy to enhance the quality of compressed music files just as well. There’s even a built-in microphone for easy hands-free calling on the go, without having to pull your phone out; great for catching up with friends while travelling, and hopping onto work meetings while sitting in a cafe.</p>



<p>Pairing these Bluetooth headphones with up to two devices at the same time is made possible with Multipoint connection. For instance, if you have them connected to your phone and laptop, you can stream music on the former and quickly switch to the latter when it’s time for a Zoom session. Those losing track of their essentials often will appreciate how you can check the last known location of the headphones in Google’s Find My Device app on your smartphone.</p>
<p>Battery life is significantly better than most other options in this range. You’re looking at around 50 hours of continuous listening on a single charge. That’s more than enough to get through at least a few days without worrying about running out. Running low but don’t have the time to juice them up fully? No sweat. A quick 3-minute top-up gets you an additional 90 minutes of playback!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4594/">There’s a lot more to like about these headphones, especially now at their current price.</a> These offer exceptional battery life and impressive sound, plus let you customize your listening experience according to your preferences. All six colors are discounted, so you can pick the one that fits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/high-on-life-2-devs-on-the-art-of-making-a-comedy-game-sequel-ign-first</link>
            <guid>1379908</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of our ongoing month-long exclusive coverage of High on Life 2, the upcoming first-person shooter, I sat down with Squanch Games Chief Creative Officer Mikey Spano and Chief Design Officer Erich Meyr to discuss the art of making a comedy game sequel. Is it any easier to pull off than the comedy movie sequel, which doesn't have a great overall track record. All that and more are covered in the interview you can watch in the video above or read in the transcript below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">High on Life 2 will be released on February 13, 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S – including launching on day one into Xbox Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I've got a hundred questions here, not literally 100, but there's a lot I want to ask you guys. And I thought I'd kind of start here. And that is, I don't know if you'd agree, but in my opinion, comedy sequels, at least in the movie side of entertainment, don't have an awesome track record, so how do you approach doing a comedy game sequel to avoid some of the same pitfalls that comedy movie sequels seem to fall into?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I feel like a lot of movie sequels in general aren't better than the first, right? But game sequels are usually like a refined version of the first game. And yeah, we definitely took a lot of great ideas that we couldn't do in the first game and put them in this one, so hopefully we'll overcome that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, with the first one, I don't think we really knew what it was until it was in the hands of reviewers and we were like, "Oh, this actually turned out pretty cool." We were just so heads down on it, it was a new IP for us. So I think for this one, we had a good place to start, so we're really hoping that it's a plus up of the original. I mean, there's definitely more jank in the original than this one, which is a lot of fun and keeps things funny, but I think we'll still have plenty of just fun, weird, unexpected stuff, so I'm hoping people like it just as much as the first, if not more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Mikey, can you speak a little more to that? Because I've never made a game, I don't have the talent or skills for that, but I've talked to a million developers, reviewed, covered a million games. And I've heard that a lot where games are such a unique art form where often, they don't really come together until the very end and then suddenly you've got a game. So can you kind of talk me through not the development of the first game, but more kind of the very end that you're referencing there when it does come together, and then when it comes out and you start getting feedback from players and from reviewers? Did anything hit differently with players in the public than you thought it would, or did things surprise you versus what you'd intended or planned?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, definitely. I mean, there's a lot of angles we can look at for High On Life in particular. We're pretty open with our team about letting them put in stuff that they're interested in. And then usually they'll just reach out and say, "Hey, is this cool or does this work?" But towards the end, we have people we trust a lot that just can go in and do stuff if they want. So from a perspective of even just the dev that was working on directing the game, we saw stuff, or at least I can say I saw stuff that I didn't even know was in the game, and I am in there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw things in some streams where I'm like, "Where did that even come from? Oh my God, that's awesome." That kind of stuff was really surprising and fun and that was intentional on our part. And then there's just a bunch of stuff that kind of breaks in funny ways or things that somebody approaches it a different way than I would've approached it or someone here would've approached it. And so you get this sort of emergent comedy that's based on the players' actions and not necessarily what we intended the players' actions to be.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, in the first game, there was a bug where people were getting stuck in Applebee's and that became an internet joke for a while. And we're like, "Sure, we'll own it. Yeah, you get stuck in Applebee's forever."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, the other thing we struggle with is, we call it dev eyes, where it's like you've just been looking at the game for so long. All the jokes you've heard a thousand times, they might've been funny the first time. And so you never really know at the end, what's going to land with people because for you, you're so numb to this stuff. So you sort of give it to a friend to play or we'll get some people in and we'll watch them play and evaluate, "Oh, that's surprising, this was their favorite part." And it's something we've seen so much, we weren't even thinking about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. That happened with us with our demo, where we put in so many good jokes throughout it. And then the thing that resonated the most was taking Sheath and turning him into a gun and that whole bit, the whole joke of that bit. And I don't think any of us expected that to be the biggest hit. We were like, "Oh no, it's going to be this part or this part." But I mean, the internet doesn't lie, right? That was the part people watched the most.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: What ultimately then, were the lessons that you took out of the first game when you're talking about kind of more hitting the ground running here with High On Life 2? What are those lessons that you took from the first one that are helping this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I mean, we definitely knew the formula we wanted to do. We knew how a lot of jokes worked. We knew how we did an interactive gameplay with them, and we could take that and be like, "Let's do that kind of thing here, that kind of thing here," or, "Let's one up that one." So it gave us a really good platform to stand on as far as figuring out what all of our different moments would be, what our jokes would be, so that was really great. That helped us tremendously at the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then also just, there was a whole can of worms around how do you handle having all these different guns and each one can be out and each one can have its own little comedy layer to a mission? And so we learned a lot of lessons from that and we're able to just like every mission now, we're like, "Yeah, we can focus on this gun here and we can do this here." It really helped us understand how to just build our game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, for sure. We had the foundation. I mean, in the first game, we kind of take for granted that we were figuring out the gameplay, too. It's a first person shooter, but outside of knowing that it was a first person shooter, we had to figure out everything from the ground up, which is a lot harder than you would think. Starting with that foundation helped us game play-wise to really focus on the things that were working, try not to change those too much. And then the things that weren't working, building on them, and then also just bringing in some new stuff that we wouldn't have been able to bring into the first game because we were just figuring out the basics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that goes across comedy, too. I mean, we are always trying jokes that don't land. We're trying ways to tell the jokes that don't always work. And we end up with the best, but a lot of that stuff didn't work for one reason or another. And so we have that stuff left over for the next game that we can try again. And we're never really starting from zero per se, with this sequel. I mean, conceptually, there's a lot of stuff that's from zero, but in terms of our systems and everything, we had a good starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A lot of developers I know these days just pull a ton of telemetry from players when they're playing. So when it's out there in the wild, kind of building on what you guys are saying, did any particular telemetry jump out at you guys, like people watching a surprisingly high amount of the in-game TV or barely looking at it at all, then maybe you take that and you either double down on something or scale back on something for the sequel?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. I mean, this is a little bit anecdotal from just hearing it everywhere, not necessarily a more qualitative thing, but just the many people who love Tammy and the T-Rex from that. You especially go through Steam reviews or whatever and yeah, there's certain things like that, that we did not expect to hit so strongly. And then yeah, I mean, just like any other game too, you kind of see where people fell off, like how many people played at the beginning. And for us, we were on Game Pass, so a lot of people tried the game, which was great. And we could see how far... Like any game, you have the curve of a lot of people get through the beginning and then you don't have as many people who actually finish it, but even people who didn't finish it still really enjoyed it. So it's cool to see that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we kind of had a unique situation where we had so many players. We were not anticipating that, but I think we're over 20 million players at this point on the game, which is insane. So pretty much every little area of the game was poked at in a way we didn't expect and it was really fun to watch that happen. I mean, you're stressed about, "Oh man, somebody found this bug," or, "Somebody exploited this thing," and you get stressed about it. But then you realize most people are out there just kind of having fun and laughing at it. And with 20 million people, there was quite a few variations of things people were hyper focused on or laughing about. I mean, some of my favorite stuff that came out of it is just the weird Hentai fan art of the guns, there's just so much. We hit every facet of weird internet culture and I love it, I couldn't be happier about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: That's awesome. I mean, on that note, I wanted to ask you guys about Game Pass because I think Game Pass has been in the news lately for at least maybe not players' favorite reasons recently, but I think more broadly than that, and I even would say this from where I sit as somebody that covers Xbox and talks about Xbox on an Xbox podcast all the time, there's a lot of confusion, I think, from players about the business side of how Game Pass works. Now, I'm not asking you guys to share the terms of your deal with Microsoft or anything like that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But clearly the first game, as you're talking about, Mikey, that was a huge success for you guys on the back of launching straight into Game Pass. So can you talk about what worked for you with that deal, what you got out of it, basically? Obviously, you mentioned 20 million players, but do you see Steam sales spike when it hits Game Pass or stuff like that? I don't know if, again, without maybe opening up the company's books or anything, which, I know you're not going to do that, but can you kind of speak to the fallout, if you will, of being on Game Pass?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I look at Game Pass as a way to get people who are curious about your game. It's almost like a way to just demo games that are on Game Pass, where it reminds me of those old PlayStation Underground CDs you used to get in the mail. Game Pass to me is sort of that feeling. There's so many games that I'm interested in, but it's unlikely I'm going to buy every single one for a variety of reasons. So with Game Pass, it's like I'll check this game out. And typically I fall off. I have really bad ADD, so I'll fall off after an hour or something. And I think with High On Life, we had a lot of people that love Rick and Morty or hated Rick and Morty, but either way they knew about the game for that reason and maybe they wanted to hate play it. And then they ended up actually liking it. And then you kind of build this buzz around, "Have you guys heard of this crazy game," where somebody might not have taken the plunge and bought the full price game, so the online sentiment wouldn't have been as big. It wouldn't have been such a big conversation around the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that really helped us with marketing the game, especially as a new studio with a new IP and everything. Without Game Pass, we would've had very little visibility, so it was beneficial in that way. And I think there's some ways now that Game Pass has evolved a little where they're allowing people to come out simultaneously day one on PlayStation or come out on Steam. And that kind of stuff, we have no idea how that's going to work out, but based on what happened with the first game, I'm thinking it's going to be really big for us because we still get that conversation around the game from people playing Game Pass. But then people on PlayStation, they don't have to wait a year and then kind of forget about it and then restart the conversation. I think Game Pass is going to be even better for us this time than it was for the first game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, it's hard. I mean, these days, there's a lot of good games coming out all the time. I'm constantly shocked when I'm like, "Wait, what is this game that looks like everything I want from the game, but it came out two years ago?" And I follow news and everything, so getting a good amount of attention to your game is critical.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A big new feature of High On Life 2 is skateboarding. I'm a big first person shooter fan and I've played a million of them over the years, and I'm trying to think if I've ever played a first person shooter that has skateboarding in it. Where does the idea come from for that? How does that kind of come up and then hone in as a key new feature of the sequel?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, this is a really interesting one because this is something both Eric and I really wanted on the first game. We had a concept artist, Sean McNally, who, amazing concept artist. You can use his name in here if you want. He's great, love the guy, very talented. We were kind of coming up, "What are some other things you can do with aliens and alien life forms?" And he had drawn this sort of pill bug that unfolded into a skateboard and we were like, "Ah, God, we got to get this-"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, it was so cool. We were like, "We could just throw this in as a thing you could temporarily have for a moment in a level or something."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And then in my head, it was like the boot in Mario 3 or something, where an enemy and you use it temporarily. And so when we started High On Life 2, we started kicking the conversation around again, "What if we had a power up that let you kind of skateboard?" And so it was meant to just be a little thing. And we started playing with it and the fun was there, but there was so much complexity that I got to the point as like... I grew up skateboarding, I love skateboarding, but I got to the point where I was like, "It's just too risky, we can't do it." And then Eric was like, "I'm not letting go of this." </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: In the first game when we were figuring out a traversal kit, at one point we had this sort of omnidirectional boost thing and it was kind of cool. It helped the momentum of the game, but it just didn't have anything grounding it. We converted it into sort of a power slide, which was really fun the first game. It's my favorite thing to do in that game. And then really, we talked about the skateboard in our creative meetings and we're like, "Yeah, let's do it. Let's figure out some cool thing with a skateboard." And at first I was like, "Well, it'll just be power slide plus. You can slide now, but you can go for longer because you're on a skateboard." And then we did a whole bunch of refactoring our traversal kit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We kind of really improved all of our movement and a lot of things, me and Carl Glave, who's our programmer for all the traversal stuff. And then we were tagging the skateboard and as we kept going with it, we're like, "Well, yeah, you should be able to go up a vert ramp. Yeah, of course. You should be able to do this, all the skateboarding things." And we were looking at Tony Hawk and a bunch of different games like Session and Skate and stuff that are really technical skating games. And we were like, "Well, we can't do all that technical stuff." There's not enough buttons. You got to shoot as well, you can't just not do all that. But we started just refining and refining and reducing things, but also making it just a really smooth experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I really just wanted you to feel like you're on a skateboard, it's doing what you want to do while you're shooting at guys, while you're doing all these other things that are taking up most of your mental space, but you still get that feeling like you're on a board and you can jump off ramps and go and wall ride and do all kinds of cool stuff with it. So we just kept kind of refining it and making it smoother and just more intuitive, and not super technical because that competed too much with the shooter aspect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the hardest thing for a new mechanic like that is it's risky, it's unknown. We looked at a lot of different comps and a lot of other games had been doing kind of similar stuff to try to get some ideas and it really was just an accumulation of just hammering on it and iterating on it continuously and making some really good calls at different points to make it. There was a whole group effort deciding exactly what this needs to do and what it should not do. And that got us to a really good spot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: And a sequel's boring if it's not taking any creative risks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Exactly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And I keep thinking, "Did we take enough creative risks on this game?" And I'm like, "Oh wait, we completely changed-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, yeah. I mean, to me it's like the Terminator 2, right? Everyone can agree Terminator 2 is a great sequel. Terminator one is great too, but 2, they're like, "Well, we're going to make a quicksilver Terminator," which could have totally failed. Could have been like, "No, I want Arnold Schwarzenegger." But they put something new in with what you already had and made an awesome new experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, for sure. The funny little anecdote, Eric mentioned Carl, Carl's an amazing programmer that we have and he is very motion sick sensitive. I don't know exactly the right phrasing for it, but he gets motion sick very easily. And so putting him on the skateboard is so cool, but he did such a good job with it. And I think a lot of the smoothness that you get from it comes from him just being like, "Oh, these numbers make me want to puke. Let me tweak that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, yeah. No, he made sure it's motion sick friendly, which, in first person is insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, it's crazy. I honestly thought it'd be a fun little power up. There's no way I would want to play a whole game where I'm riding a skateboard and shooting. And I was so wrong, it's so cool. It's my favorite part of the game for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Mikey, you said you grew up skating and there's such... I mean, the artwork for both games, just High On Life in general has such great artwork.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Thank you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: A custom skate deck for High On Life 2 – maybe like a collector's edition thing, limited. Are we going to do that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I will say that we have our biz dev guy, Benny Moore, he comes from Limited Run, so he knows that space really well. And then we just hired somebody, I believe it's merchandising director. I don't know his name, but it's another one that we know from Limited Run, Shaddy, and he's amazing, too. And so he's taking on a lot of really cool merchandising stuff for us. I can say I love skateboards, I love physical stuff. As you can see, my office is full of collectible stuff, so it's a pretty safe bet that there'll be some of my own life decks out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: The hardest thing is going to be choosing which ones to use, because we have a bunch of decks in the game with awesome art on them and there's a lot of ones that, I can't pick a favorite. There's a lot of really, really cool decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. For this game, I have a big group of weird, low brow art friends and I wanted to bring them on to do graffiti and signs and stuff like that for us. And it worked out really well that they were able to all do deck designs for us, too. So we have so many cool, weird, unexpected decks in the game that I want to see all of them turn into a physical deck at some point. And I love the idea of a voting system of, "All right, for this next run, here's three. Which one do you guys want to see next?" And keep pitting them against each other. That could be really fun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Pivoting back to the video game itself, the weapons, clearly the stars of High On Life and justifiably so. When you're looking at adding new ones for the sequel, I'm curious, where do you start? Do you start with weapon function like, "Well, do we want a rocket launcher type? Do we want this chain gun, this kind of that?" Or do you start with a personality type and then figure out what gun function it should be? Or do you start with an actor in mind and then kind of build a gun around that? I'm really curious to the process because the guns are such a unique aspect of High On Life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. Typically, I mentioned earlier, I'm super ADD, so I'm always doodling. Even in meetings and stuff, I'll be doodling. So Eric and I will be talking about, "What's a gun archetype we want that we don't have yet?" And so while we're talking, I'll start usually just doodling a few things and I'll show it to Eric and say, "What do you think about this functionality? Does this functionality seem cool?" And then he'll give me some notes and maybe he'll do a sketch and we just kind of go back and forth, honing in on a shotgun archetype. Gus is our shotgun archetype and=</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, that's how we figured out a lot of the first game's guns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we're a very visual based studio, we let the vibes lead our design. And then Eric and Nick, who is our technical director, but also our combat director for this game, he gets really into the weeds about how the functionality works and, "Let's tune this number and let's try this." And all of that kind of goes back and forth and informs the general look of the gun. And usually when I'm sketching these guns up, I'm thinking about an actor like Sheath from the very beginning, I wanted to be Ralph Ineson. He's been my white whale for years and we finally got him. And so that whole time, I knew that's what I wanted him to look like. And for the caps from the first game, a lot of that look came from just Jim Henson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you look at the really old, fat, weird Kermit the Frog, that's Creature. There's just a bunch. I have all this reference from the game where, believe it or not, Knifey is basically Elmo without a nose or hair. And that's kind of where I started because I thought it would be a fun nod. I love leaning on cultural stuff that exists already, so I'm always putting little nods to everything. And trying to find more Muppets for this game didn't really work out right away, so I just kind of went with what felt right. And luckily, Eric and Nick and I were able to come up with some archetypes that felt really good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah. When we kicked this game off, we locked ourselves in this rental office for a week. Me and Mikey and Alec Robbins, our native director, Nick, and Maddie, our producer, our EP, to just oversee everything. And we just broke down a bunch of stuff from the game. I just remember one of the things we did was we had a big whiteboard of just every gun archetype imaginable and then being like, "Okay, what would fit? What's going to be the next things that would fit into our mix?" And then started playing with those and sort of integrating some of them into the story as we were talking about story as well. I don't remember all the details.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah. And on the first game, like I was saying earlier, we didn't really know what it was, so I drew a million guns. So this game, before I even did anything, I was like, "What about this sheet that we had? Is there anything on here that's a good starting point?" But I don't think we ended up bringing any of that on. The bow and arrow was a new concept, I don't think anything existed for that and Sheath was all new. Travis and Jan were pretty much all new. So even though we started with some of the older sketches, they changed enough that it was just pretty much from scratch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Well, speaking of the voice actors for the weapons in High On Life, when you're writing now the sequel, obviously, do you really even write lines for JB Smoove, or do you just give him some ideas and outlines and then just hit record in the VO booth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I wish the latter was possible, but it's just wrangling somebody who's really good at ad-libbing when we have such a tight story. Especially in this game, we focused a lot more on a tight narrative. Alec and his team, Alec Robbins, our Narrative Director and effectively our head writer, him and his team just wrote so much amazing stuff that getting the actor into the booth and getting all of it read out, you've played the game so you interact with someone, they're not just saying one thing, they're saying a bunch of things. And each of those things has multiple permutations. And so there's just really no way to get an actor in and say, "Go crazy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the first game, it happened just out of necessity, given the structure of the game, but for this one, we wanted to do a better job and tighten things up. And so we do start pretty much everything written and then we'll have them read the line the way it's written and then, "All right, well, how would you say this line?" And then some of those are the ones that are the funniest and sometimes just reading it as is works better. But it's very taxing on the voice actors to ask for ad lib, especially in that setting, so it can be really tricky. Sometimes it just happens on its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, we like to encourage it. And this time, I mean, this game has so much more dialogue than the first game that some of those record sessions were like, "We got to move. We can't ad lib for an hour on this guy." So yeah, it was a lot to get, especially with the guns. And Gus and Sweezy in particular, they're around for the whole game, so they're a lot of dialogue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: JB is such a master improviser, I just was curious. It's interesting to hear that you almost had to just keep him on script.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, a lot of people go crazy in moments for sure, but you're getting through so many lines, yeah, we kind of had to just let it go off the script first and foremost and then mess around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: You mentioned the whiteboard of weapon archetypes, that you lock yourself in a WeWork space for a week at the beginning of the project to start to hash out. Did you have any weapons or weapon ideas that had hit the cutting room floor? You're talking about stuff that got cut from the first game. Was anything from the first game that made its way into this one in terms of the weapons?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I'm trying to remember. The first game, well, one thing we had in the first game, Sweezy, there was going to be two Sweezys at one point, right, Mikey? One of them died and became a ghost?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: You had this ghost gun that you could summon, but it never really got traction. We've been wanting to do the dual pistols. I really wanted initially, Eric Andre and Hannibal Burris, just one gun that was overly confident and kind of funny, and then one that just talked to the other gun the whole time. And that was sort of the archetype we were talking about. And then as we got closer, I don't remember who pitched it, but we were like, "It would just be funny if it was just a couple in a relationship and that you had-"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I think we were all watching Righteous Gemstones at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: I think that's probably what it was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: And we were like, "Oh yeah, that relationship is like the..." I forget the character's names, but it's so funny. And so we're like, "We should hone in on that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah. And so then we kind of started with that as sort of the archetype. And then we had different actors in mind for the guns initially, and then we kind of just kept swapping actors around based on availability and what the game needed. And we ended up with Ken Marino, who's amazing, so-</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: So good, such a good performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, he's just so pro. He gets it, he just nails it. And Gabourey Sidibe, who, she played Mucks in our DLC, but now she plays Jan. And those two together are so funny, it's fantastic. Those two guns, at first, I thought would be a fun little joke for a mission or something, but they're probably the most memorable narrative-wise from the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: I think so too, yeah. Because it's two guns and they span over a couple missions, you get a lot of... Their story becomes actually a pretty prominent story in the whole game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Was replacing Kenny in the game from the DLC and now in the sequel, easier than recasting Kenny? Because I mean, you've got the two new voice actors for Rick and Morty now who are just dead on perfect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Yeah, we actually didn't want to bring Kenny over for this game. We're not done with Kenny in the universe, but he's just not part of the story of this game. We will be recasting Kenny, of course, but assuming we continue to make High On Life, which I will fight tooth and nail to keep doing, we still want Kenny to be a part of this universe and he's got a lot more to his story than what we saw in the first game and in DLC. I think our narrative wrapper was that Kenny just got dropped or something in the DLC, but I think that there's more to that story than we let players know, and so we'll be hopefully talking a little bit more about that in future game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, this game takes place five years after the original, so we kind of alluded some of the things that happened in that time span, but that's definitely an area that we'll explore more in this game and in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: The last question I have for you guys is, you touched on it already with talking about how much more dialogue there is in this one, but scope-wise, for me, I really thought the first game was just the perfect... It didn't overstay its welcome, but it wasn't like a four-hour game by any stretch either. I just thought it really hit its mark super well. So are you aiming for a similar scope to the first game with this one or we go and... What's the thought process there?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: We're a little bit larger for sure. We wanted to give a little more. This game especially has a much more kind of, I'd just say mature narrative. There's more going on with it. We actually hit our themes a lot stronger at the end and everything, so we wanted to give it more time to feel like a good sequel. And then we actually have quite a bit more sort of side content you can do in this one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the first game we sort of have, you could go back to areas, you could bring in some more bases for a little fun vignettes. In this one, you kind of have these regions in the hub that you can actually go around and find cool stuff in and kind of dig into more and just skate, you can just skate over the whole place. So we definitely have a little more extra time for folks who want to mess around as well. We're definitely shooting for a bit of a longer game than the first one, but by no means, this isn't an RPG length game. We're trying to keep it a nice narrative you can play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: For the first game, we didn't really know how long it was going to be. And then it came out and we were like, "Okay, good. It was enough." For me, as an older gamer, 10 hours is my favorite amount of time to put into a game. Past that, I get stressed. And so we didn't want to get too far from 10 hours, but then at the same time, we had so much we wanted to do that things just kept growing. And honestly, I don't know how long the game is. It could be 1,000 hours, it could be 11 hours. I really don't know at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll know the day before it comes out, how long it really is. But I think it's safe to say it's a decent bit longer than the first game. Our initial desire was 25% more, but I actually think we've probably exceeded that by a bit. And then that's not even thinking about all the new side content and just skating around, doing challenges and stuff like that, so there's a lot there. And it's not all narrative comedy. There's a lot of the side stuff that's just pure gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: Yeah, just fun gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: It hopefully doesn't overstay its welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Eric Meyer</strong>: On this one in particular, we try to make every level very unique. And you're still using all your core mechanics, but there's a lot of levels we're not going to talk about until they release because they're awesome surprises. And so hopefully that keeps. Especially, I know some games midway through, you're kind of like, "All right," I get it. So hopefully we can keep that pacing going for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mikey Spano</strong>: Each act, if not each mission, could be its own game. All the guns, each time you get a new gun, everything changes. Each time you get to a new location, it's a surprise. And we didn't do a ton of retread this time other than sidetracking or side missions, I guess. It's a lot, and I think people won't get too exhausted with it just because the variety is so broad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <guid>1379905</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Not in Kansas anymore.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's new housing feature has been available for those who pre-purchased the upcoming Midnight expansion for over a week now, which naturally means folks have had plenty of time to get really, <em>really</em> creative with their new library of decor. One of the wildest player discoveries early on was finding a trick that would make houses float in the air, which a number of people have used to make wild flying creations. Better yet, instead of patching it out, Blizzard has surprisingly given its blessing for airborne abodes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lofting one's house was discovered almost immediately after the housing feature dropped, with players initially using it simply to raise their homes in the air as a fun gimmick.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apparently, flying houses are surprisingly easy to do. If you're just using the base creation tools, you're never going to be able to do this on accident, as the most you can do is move the house around on the ground within your lot. However, players using Advanced Mode can raise a house by moving any decor object inside or attached to exterior of the house, and then lifting that object up in the air. The house goes with it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As time has gone on, players have gotten even wackier with their flying houses, using them to create elaborate constructions such as airships:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mechanical wonders:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And other assorted creations:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this discovery was made, players have been understandably concerned that Blizzard would patch it out, as it didn't seem to be intended behavior from houses. However, Blizzard has taken a surprising step in sanctioning the hovering homes, and even actively trying to make it easier to create them. A recent post on the forums from community manager Kaivax reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Almost immediately after the 11.2.7 patch went live, we saw players using keybinds to elevate houses off the ground, even though there weren’t UI controls for that. We quickly began work to enable the controls so that it would be easier to move a house upward.</blockquote><blockquote>We have two concerns, of course:</blockquote><blockquote>The underside of houses aren’t modeled or textured. Players who lift their houses may decide to hide that part behind other things.</blockquote><blockquote>If you lift your house up, clicking on the door could become difficult. You might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle or a mount landing spot, etc.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, totally fair PSAs from Blizzard there, though it does lead one to wonder if long-term we might see some decor aimed at flying homes specifically if they get popular enough. Now if only we could have an entire floating city-wait, we what? Uh, scratch that. I'm going back home.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <p>A leaked trailer for 007 First Light - the Bond origin game from Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> - has shined a light on one the villains set to appear in the upcoming release. And, they are played by a name you will likely recognise, but perhaps not expect.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of potential 007 First Light spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/007-twitter-account-jumps-the-gun-and-posts-trailer-announcing-first-light-villain.1379350/#post-148736176">leaked trailer for 007: First Light</a> reveals that American rock musician and Hunger Games actor Lenny Kravitz will star in the upcoming release as Bawma, who shares Kravitz's likeness. The footage, which evidently went live earlier than intended, shows Bawma sitting in a rather plush armchair, monologuing a bit as many Bond villains seem to find themselves doing.</p>
<p>"I am sometimes asked 'Bawma, how is it that you hear every whisper, of every corner of Aleph'," Bawma says. "And I answer, I have built Aleph with my will, my blood, my whole self. This city is an extension of my being. My body. And today, it became infected."</p>
<p>Bawma then gets his cronies to launch Bond into a pit of crocs. "Easy girls," the villain coos.</p>
<p>It is fair to assume Kravitz's inclusion in the upcoming game was meant to be revealed at The Game Awards later this evening, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">007 First Light is nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. So, stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>007 First Light will launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC on 27th March next year.</p>
<p>For more on IOI and Bond, our Alex recently got a closer look at 007 First Light, stating it's "so much more than Hitman", and thanks to "its 'breathing' structure", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">it looks like "the ultimate composite video game"</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-reached-record-sales-generating-10-billion-in-revenue/</link>
            <guid>1379878</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>For years now, Tencent has been placing investments across the video game industry, acquiring stakes in a variety of companies and, in some cases, acquiring them entirely. It's been a slow-burning strategy that has undoubtedly paid off, as exemplified in a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-09/tencent-goes-hands-on-to-reshape-10-billion-global-games-empire?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTM3MzA1NywiZXhwIjoxNzY1OTc3ODU3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNjdZOFdLR0NURlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI2RjZBMkE0Njg3MjI0Q0I1ODNBQkMwQTNDRDI0RDM5OCJ9.uRCAYv2eub16WLwH8iuw-3CIHjLxG2B4hP4gOF4G9AU">Bloomberg</a> report where chief executive officer Michelle Liu discusses her methodology that helped Tencent generate <strong>$10 billion in revenue</strong> over the past year.</p>



<p>Not only did the report include the gargantuan sales record, but it also included a few notable bits of information on how Tencent treats its relationships with the studios it acquires. Dune: Awakening developer Funcom and Dying Light: The Beast developer Techland are mentioned specifically as having benefitted from Liu and Tencent's guidance.</p>



<p>"<em>If they could already achieve everything on their own, what would they need me for?</em>" Liu said. "Tencent has a lot of experience with data analysis, benchmarks, and criteria." Experience that has clearly benefitted its partners and the studios it acquired.</p>



<p>The chart below shows just how much bigger Tencent is than other major game publishers and platforms like Roblox, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">even as Roblox smashes concurrent player count records</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Tencent-Global-Gaming-Business-Chart-Bloomberg.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Bloomberg</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>We can always count on an extra point of view that helps us to improve the game</em>," said Techland founder Pawel Marchewka regarding Tencent's guidance in an interview at Gamescom 2025. Funcom chief executive officer Rui Casais added, at a separate Gamescom interview, "<em>When Tencent came in, they said, 'Look, you're spreading your attention.' You have a great IP that you've secured, you should really focus on that and drop the other things</em>."</p>



<p>While Funcom has not been able to avoid layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/funcom-announces-layoffs-despite-dune-awakening-being-biggest-release-in-32-year-history/">Dune: Awakening was the studio's biggest launch in its entire history</a>. Techland was able to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/">sell over a million copies of Dying Light: The Beast at launch on Steam alone,</a> not including those players who got it for free as part of the Dying Light 2: Stay Human bundle they had purchased.</p>



<p>Of course, it's the teams that worked on those games that deserve the credit for their successes, but Liu's earlier point still stands, and it's becoming clear that Tencent is capable of directing teams to success. We'll see if that continues to be the case <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">with its new venture with Ubisoft and Vantage Studios</a>, but $10 billion in revenue is nothing to shake your stick at.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that another retro game has made its way to the Nintendo Switch Online service, and this time, it's beloved GameCube platformer <em>Wario World</em>.</p><p>Yesterday, the gaming giant revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-n64-december-2025-rayman" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c545bd7-8940-4a33-a061-5c9542586bb3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">two N64 platformers</a> would make their way to the service, but now, if you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="241c07c4-1dc7-413f-8a41-5b112e805b97" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a Switch 2 player</a> (and a Switch Online Expansion Pack member, of course), you can enjoy a third at no extra cost.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Wario World</em>, it's a 3D platformer released for the GameCube back in 2003. Unlike its sister <em>Mario </em>series, <em>Wario World </em>is largely a linear affair that mixes in elements of beat-'em-ups and other genres as well.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Although the game is, of course, published by Nintendo, <em>Wario World </em>was developed by Treasure, best known for run-and-gun games and shooters like <em>Radiant Silvergun </em>and <em>Gunstar Heroes</em>.</p><p>At time of writing, <em>Wario World </em>is still the last mainline 3D platformer in which the character appeared; he's starred in <em>WarioWare </em>minigame compilations and 2D sidescrollers since, but <em>Wario World </em>is still the place to go if you want to see him strutting his stuff in 3D.</p><p><em>Wario World </em>joins a number of other GameCube games that have made their way to Nintendo Switch Online; others include the likes of "survival horror" classic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="559128f7-0f60-43f5-a4e0-64e6a9d1d5b0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Luigi's Mansion</em></a> and platformer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chibi-robo-switch-online" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5eda1a19-710c-4126-8f24-86dd16fbc1ae" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Chibi-Robo!</em></a>.</p><p>They've joined an initial lineup that includes games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-Zero GX</em>, and <em>SoulCalibur II</em>, and with more being drip-fed to subscribers on a regular basis, it's a good time to be nostalgic for the GameCube.</p>
<p><em>Wario World </em>is available right now via Nintendo Switch Online, but you will need an Expansion Pack addon to play it. Thankfully, you'll also get access to Genesis, N64, and Game Boy Advance games if you pick it up, so it's not just GameCube titles waiting for you.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Around this time last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">filled with squishy squids</a>. These squishy squids have since come close to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">squishing Super Earth</a>.</p>
<p>Also being squished in late 2024 were some players' positive perceptions of Arrowhead's gear pricing, as a Killzone crossover arrived and was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-suitably-festive-solution-killzone-collab-price-backlash">so throughly panned for being expensive</a> that the studio ended up giving the last bit of it away for free as a make-good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As of December 18th, though, the Killzone gear'll be making a long-awaited return to the shooter's store with some extra additions to help it feel fresh. This time in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/11/the-helldivers-2-x-killzone-items-return-as-a-legendary-warbond-dec-18/">warbond form</a> for the collective price of 1500 super credits, rather than as individually-sold bits which add up to cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>If you paid for all or even one bit of this Killzone gear when it was on offer last December, this new warbond'll land in your inventory for free, with no need to re-spend any medals either. Meanwhile, if you only got the bits given away for free in 2024 or are a player who's hopped into the game since then, you'll have to fork over those 1.5k super credits.</p><p>As for what's in the warbond, the answer starts with three primary guns. There's the drum-magged StA-52 Assault rifle, the up-close killer StA-11 SMG, and the precise, charge-based PLAS-39 Accelerator rifle. Two armour sets, the heavy AC-1 Dutiful gear and light AC-2 Obedient getup, go with those and come with the Acclimated passive ability, offering 50% resistance to fire, gas, acid, and electrical damage. Finally, there are the usual capes and paints.</p>
<p>While there's no evidence it's due to arrive anywhere near as soon as this Killzone warbond, assuming it does at all, Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-little-fanfare-helldivers-2s-creative-director-shares-that-arrowhead-are-prototyping-a-roguelite-mode">let slip the other day</a> that Arrowhead have been prototyping a roguelite mode for the buggy shooter.</p>

            <p>
You know that weird chime that plays when you find a secret in the classic Tomb Raider games? Play it now in your head. You weren’t alive when those games were published? I hate you. I hate you. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22VhPV3ml7U">here you go</a>.  Great, now we’re ready to talk about the leaked images of Tomb Raider: Legacy Of Atlantis, which appears to be the new Tomb Raider game due to be announced at G-Star K-Dog’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-livestream">Game Awards show tonight</a>. Or at least, one of them.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The leaked images come via Resetera, with posters <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-leak-spoilers-potential-box-art-and-some-info-of-tr1-remake-%E2%80%9Cretelling%E2%80%9D-has-leaked.1379143/">noting</a> that Lara Croft’s pose in the supposed boxart matches her pose in the teaser for a <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1998093291594883300">“future of Tomb Raider” presentation</a> at tonight’s festive Keighley-hauling. Hello Resetera users! I read your mean comments about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-games-of-all-time">our best PC games feature</a>. Spare me your kneejerk Blizzard fandom, you casuals. Still, all is forgiven as long as you keep filching alleged videogame titbits from Geoff Keighley's undies.</p>
<p>The screens appear to be trailer grabs, and show a freshly-revarnished Lara sporting her legendary blue top and twin pistols. There is minimal evidence so far of the screechy Croft mutilation we saw in the more recent borderline horror survivalism-themed games.
</p>



<p>
There is minimal evidence of much personality at all, to be honest. I confess, I’ve been sitting on this leak because, frankly, the images seem rather bland and recycled, to the point that I worried they’d been AI-generated for kicks using a combination of Lara Croft character models from various generations of Tomb Raiding. Mind you, that could be because this is a remake of the very first Lara Croft outing on PS1, spliced with the look and feel of the more recent Tomb Raider reboots under Crystal Dynamics. Lara’s gear in the image certainly gives that impression.
</p><p>
There have already been two Tomb Raider reboot trilogies, plus remasters of the first six games under Core Design. Tomb Raider has pillaged itself so often I’m not sure new varieties of Lara are conceivable. Still, please accept my totally original, never before expressed suggestion: why not, like, let Lara Croft age? Instead of resetting her every 10 years because entertainment culture at large has an institutional terror of older women in action roles?
</p>
<p>
Here is my other, definitely not original suggestion, inasmuch as I think I’ve written it on these pages before: pretty please Crystal, can you do a Tomb Raider franchise soap opera in which all the various incarnations of Lara hang out in their mansion and solve mysteries? I've got personalities worked out for each of them based on my expertise in 90s television. OG Lara Croft is the Phoebe, Angel of Darkness Croft is the Joey. Legends and 2013 Croft are Monica and Chandler. Ross gets to be Lara Croft Go and Rachel can be that Game Boy one I've forgotten the name of. Look, roll with it for fuck's sake. This is still more convincing than a Croft who can't seem to grow out of her twenties.
</p>
<p>Terrible jokes aside, I hope Crystal Dynamics make this work. They've been through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-make-yet-more-layoffs-withjust-under-30-workers-losing-their-jobs">rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">layoffs</a> in the past year. Best of luck with tonight's announcements, all.

            <guid>1379854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="98" data-end="638">Many laptop users rely solely on the hardware built into their machines, and while modern laptops are impressively capable, doing everything on the laptop alone can actually hold you back. Even a 17-inch notebook—considered fairly large by portable-PC standards—still feels small compared to the displays most people use today. External monitors commonly start around 27 inches, offering significantly more screen real estate, and some setups go far beyond that with ultra-wide or even 4K panels that dramatically expand your field of view.</p>
<p data-start="640" data-end="1240">If you spend a lot of time typing at your desk, you might prefer the feel and responsiveness of a mechanical keyboard over your laptop’s built-in keys. Maybe your laptop’s speakers don’t produce the volume or clarity you want, leading you to plug in external ones. Add in a separate microphone for calls, a pair of headphones for focus, or even a drawing tablet if you’re an artist, and suddenly you have an entire desk ecosystem of peripherals that your laptop needs to connect to. The problem? Many modern laptops come with only one or two USB ports—nowhere near enough for all these accessories.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">That’s where a reliable USB hub becomes essential. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">The Anker USB-C docking station fits this role perfectly, and even better, it’s currently available at a significant discount. Right now you can save 38%,</a> which knocks $27 off the original price. Instead of paying $70, you’ll only spend $43—a great deal for the functionality it offers.</p>
<p data-start="1242" data-end="1579">In need of more than one? The two-pack is also on sale for… exactly the same price as buying two individually… How about that?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1242" data-end="1579">Extended View with Triple Display</h2>
<p data-start="1581" data-end="2206">This docking station serves as a simple, single-cable solution that helps eliminate desk clutter and keep your workspace tidy. Plug one USB-C cable into your laptop, and suddenly all your accessories—monitors, storage devices, audio gear, and more—are connected at once. The dock supports 4K video output at up to 60Hz through its HDMI port, making it ideal for watching high-resolution content or expanding your desktop across multiple screens. While the USB-C data port doesn’t support video output, the hub includes two HDMI ports plus a VGA port, allowing you to connect as many as three external displays simultaneously.</p>


<p data-start="2208" data-end="2532">Charging is handled impressively well too. The same USB-C connection used for data and displays can also power your laptop. The dock supports up to 80W of passthrough charging, meaning you can leave your original power adapter in your bag. With the hub powering your device, you free up ports and simplify your entire setup.</p>
<p data-start="2534" data-end="2712">File transfers are fast and efficient, thanks to both USB-C and USB-A ports capable of speeds up to 5Gbps. Moving large documents, photos, or videos becomes quick and convenient.</p>
<p data-start="2714" data-end="2937" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With its current 38% price drop, the Anker USB-C hub is an excellent value. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5667/">For just $43, you get powerful connectivity, cleaner desk organization, and a smoother overall workflow—all while saving $27 off the regular price.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Faces Fresh Criticism Over PC Roadmap And Paid Weapon Skins]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579</link>
            <guid>1379848</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been a rough year for <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, a fun, very streamlined action-RPG bogged down by bad performance on PC and a lackluster cadence of post-launch content. Now Capcom has revealed Title Update 4, the latest free patch aimed at getting the multiplayer grind back on its feet. While it includes the game’s first Elder Dragon, it’s also getting flack for a PC optimization roadmap that drip-feeds fixes and new paid weapon skins that monetize part of the end-game loot chase. Nine months after launch, the latest <em>Monster Hunter</em> sequel still can’t seem to catch a break.</p> <p>Arriving December 16, the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/update/ver_01_4/">latest free content drop</a> is headlined by the Elder Dragon Gogmazios, which fans are already preparing to get demolished by. A trailer for Title Update 4 shows the ability for four players to team up with support NPCs to fight Gogma as a party of eight. In addition to new Gogma Artian Weapons, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ end-game grind will also expand with Armor Transcendence upgrades, Arch-Tempered Jin Dahaad strikes, additional support hunters Nadia and Griifin, and new optional quests.</p>

  <p>So far so good! But Capcom’s recent <em>Monster Hunter</em> showcase also revealed the game’s next set of microtransactions, the Cosmetic DLC Pack 4. This one, which isn’t part of the existing $50 Cosmetic DLC Pass, includes, among other things, new Layered Weapon designs for each weapon type. These don’t impact gameplay per se, but they do look, depending on your preference, cooler than what you earn in the game without paying. Fans aren’t stoked. “DLC like this should not exist,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjsfwl/cosmetic_dlc_pack_4_layered_armor_and_weapons/">wrote</a> on the subreddit.</p>

 <p>These kinds of ornaments, now increasingly common in other live-service games, are still relatively new to the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series. There was already a big stink in the community when Layered Weapon skins arrived in <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>. Capcom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/yxq2t4/capcom_have_removed_english_plushie_weapons_video/">even removed a trailer</a> for a paid DLC pack that made weapons look like plushies because it got downvoted so much. As one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjt0dt/its_just_stickers_its_just_poses_its_just_stuff/">recently laid</a> out, the microtransaction creep has been unrelenting. “”It’s just stickers…it’s just poses…it’s just stuff for the camp…”</p>

 <h2>Don’t expect <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC to get fixed all at once</h2> <p>There’s also the new PC optimization roadmap that Capcom revealed during the showcase. The fixes are good, but long overdue and will be spread across multiple months rather than coming in one fell swoop. The latest performance boost begins with CPU/GPU optimization in December as part of Title Update 4. Then January will add more “PC-specific” improvements to high-resolution texture packs and VRAM usage, as well as new graphics and CPU settings. Further optimization will follow in February with a patch targeting graphical detail to reduce GPU processing loads.</p>

 <p>Does that mean the PC version will finally be in tip-top shape by the one-year anniversary? Some players are skeptical that the December update will make a huge difference and are wondering why Capcom <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjshc0/tu4_optimization_roadmap/">seems to have prioritized</a> other things up to this point. “One whole entire year to get optimizations, this is why all of my hunting buddies have already quit the game,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1pjs6o5/details_and_timeline_regarding_the_promised/">wrote</a> one player on the subreddit.</p> <p>In the meantime, Steam ratings for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> have improved from a <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248">true low point over the summer</a>, but only just barely. It still hasn’t broken 70 percent positive. “I waited a long time before putting out a review of this game,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash">reads</a> one recent Steam review from a player with nearly 300 hours logged. “Please understand that I’ve been with this series since 2007, so I have an attachment to it unlike any other game series I’ve immersed myself in. To get to the point; Capcom is ridiculous for putting this game out the way they did.”</p> <p>The long road to redemption for the PC release continues.</p>

<p>The latest Escape from Tarkov patch has brought snow back for the first time in almost a year. The next time you load Escape from Tarkov, you’ll be prompted to install an update, and this is the winter update that brings crunchy, crispy snow back to Norvinsk.</p>



<p>In addition, multiple fixes were issued for some critical bugs plaguing Escape from Tarkov players. Get the full list below.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year">The Most Wonderful Time of the Year</h2>



<p>As the festive window approaches, snow has started falling in Escape from Tarkov, blanketing the game in a layer of crisp white that makes almost all outfits useless, strips foliage from every map, and deafens players using loud headsets.</p>



<p>The team at Battlestate Games rolled out the latest patch earlier today, which includes snow, along with a bunch of bug fixes and changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the loading wheel icon showing throughout the starting mission;</li>



<li>Fixed the camera lock and character movement lock that occurred when using consumable items before the second cutscene on Terminal</li>



<li>Fixed the inability to complete a specific task in the Batya story chapter in PvE mode</li>



<li>Fixed the lock for weapon operations and looting that occurred after looting a character that got killed while using a stationary weapon</li>



<li>Fixed the abrupt interruption of consumable item animations in certain cases</li>



<li>Fixed the incorrect spawn points for Zryachiy and his guards on Lighthouse</li>



<li>Fixed the audio artifacts when quickly skipping trader dialogue lines</li>

<p>Battlestate Games has been firefighting a little since Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update was released on November 15. The supersized overhaul introduced a string of issues that are slowly being addressed, but it’s often like fighting a hydra. As soon as they patch another bug, two more pop up.</p>



<p>Such is life.</p>

                <p>Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1999102778430374329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent 39.10 update</a> that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death.</p><p>Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, <a href="https://x.com/Dashybear/status/1999117362537037986" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it actually appears rather little</a>. The perspective could be off, but <a href="https://x.com/NexusFNx/status/1999114419301650916" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">based on screenshots circulating on X</a>, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as "Littlefoot," then.</p><p>This isn't the first time Bigfoot made an appearance in Fortnite. The mythical creature was a purchasable outfit in 2019, but this is its first addition as a random NPC.</p><p>While Bigfoot ducks and dodges Fortnite's gunfights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian is gearing up to serve looks</a> and bullets. The social media star will join the battle royale shooter on December 13, with all the glitz and glam you'd expect.</p>

                <p>A new report detailed how much it costs for developers to have their games shown off at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reported</a> that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer.</p><p>The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources.</p><p>The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lix-averages-record-audience-of-127-7-million-viewers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million)</a>, but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43610365/some-commercials-super-bowl-lix-sold-8m-per-reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted the organizers of The Game Awards for comment on ad pricing.</p><p>People have criticized The Game Awards for appearing to be more of a marketing event for upcoming games as opposed to a celebration of developers and their achievements. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>Host and organizer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-creator-hears-your-feedback-do-we-always-get-it-right-no/1100-6536808/" data-ref-id="1100-6536808">recently responded to these concerns</a>, saying "it is a balancing act."</p><p>"There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that the promise of new and exciting game reveals helps raise the profile of The Game Awards and inspires more people to tune in. At the same time, if more people watch, The Game Awards can in theory charge more for ad placement.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Kotaku report also mentioned that The Game Awards gives developers who are nominated for awards at least two tickets to attend the ceremony. Tickets to The Game Awards are available to the general public, and Expedition 33 developer Sandfall was reported to have "bought a swath of tickets" at around $300 each to help more staffers attend the show. Expedition 33 picked up 12 total nominations, the most ever for a game, including Game of the Year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>

              <p><span>It was a good thing that the internet bullied Paramount into fixing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-looks-uh-1834411263"><span>Sonic’s horrifying human-like form</span></a><span> in the first live-action </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span> movie. If that hadn’t happened, we likely wouldn’t have gotten the great follow-ups and Keanu Reeves playing Shadow in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-3-review-shadow-keanu-reeves-jim-carrey-1851726797"><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</span></i></a><span>. But even five years later, who wouldn’t be morbidly curious to know what the movie would have looked like if Paramount hadn’t gone back to the drawing board? That’s what a fan group is giving us the chance to find out with </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog: The 2019 Cut</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The fan remake of the 2020 film aims to recreate every shot of the movie, but with the ugly-ass hedgehog that Paramount nearly unleashed into theaters. Originally, the team of fans was going to release a trailer this week, but it has been delayed until December 24 because they weren’t “completely happy” with the final result.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We wanted Sonic’s animation to feel as fluid as possible, and to be honest, it would have gotten some negative reviews if we’d released it today,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/vYuGKoGXDr">pic.twitter.com/vYuGKoGXDr</a></p> <p>— A26 (@A26Pics) <a href="https://twitter.com/A26Pics/status/1998924804326621228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>To make up for the delay, the </span><i><span>2019 Cut </span></i><span>team released a brief first look showing ugly Sonic running on the inside of a washing machine, and yep, that really does look like that monstrosity in a scene from the final movie. Gross!</span></p>
