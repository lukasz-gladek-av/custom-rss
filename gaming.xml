<p>It sounds like the perfect way to ease yourself back into Animal Crossing: New Horizons before the game gets all manner of additions next year. As a reminder, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">New Horizons - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will arrive via a £4.19 / $4.99 upgrade path on 15th January, adding mouse mode and higher resolution alongside the chance to play online with more friends at once. On the same day, the free ver. 3.0 update will drop for Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2 users, including crossover content, a new hotel resort and more.</p>

Such a thing's natural and healthy - people care enough about the games to have thoughts about how this adaptation portrays the world in which they take place. It goes double when when you head to locations which have played host to entries especially beloved for how much say they let the player have in how their stories play out.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Spill, Aaron Moten - the actor behind Brothehood of Steel bloke Maximus - touched on this having been something he's had chats with the show's bigwigs about. Asked whether he thinks fans will be surprised by the version of New Vegas the show's about to shoot into our skulls after taking us on a nice trip to Goodsprings' cemetery, Moten said the following:</p><p>"Actually, you know what's really interesting is our storyline, where we are in time, it's a number of years after the events of New Vegas. An interesting thing, a conversation [co-showrunner] Geneva [Robertson-Dworet] and I have been having, was actually about how history is written in the wasteland by whoever writes it. Different perspectives will have a different perspective on who won and who lost. It's a really beautiful thing. We see it really early on that you guys [Lucy and The Ghoul] find out who believes themselves to be winning, and The Ghoul offering a different perspective."</p>
<p>This meshes with what Robertson-Dworet and fellow showrunner Graham Wagner said to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-season-2-creators-interview">GQ</a> last year when asked what's happened since New Vegas in their New Vegas: "All we really want the audience to know is that things have happened, so that there isn't an expectation that we pick the show up in season two, following one of the myriad canon endings that depend on your choices when you play [Fallout: New Vegas].</p>
<p>"With that post-credits stuff, we really wanted to imply, Guys, the world has progressed, and the idea that the wasteland stays as it is decade-to-decade is preposterous to us. It’s just a place [of] constant tragedy, events, horrors — there's a constant churn of trauma. We're definitely implying more has occurred."</p>
<p>Right, so here's my view on this as someone who hasn't made a blockbuster TV show, but who has done many New Vegasings, and thus spent plenty of time making choices that whatever scenario the show depicts might well not mesh with. If I was going to take a show to New Vegas after the events of the game, I'd just <strong>pick an ending</strong>. Probably whichever one I think will fit best with whatever narrative I'm planning to weave. Show off how the events following it might have played out, or fill in some interesting blanks as to what it might mean in terms of immediate consequences for the people of the wasteland.</p><p>Odds are, some people will find that take on this optional future intriguing, and reflect on choices they've personally made when playing the game. Some people will very probably dislike it, or simply not vibe with it as much. That's fine - the video game still exists and they can fire it up at any time to run around in the version of the Mojave they've shaped. Either way, the show doesn't have to spend its entire runtime shrugging or leaning on the unreliable narrator whenever someone asks what happened at that big important battle. The one which had very clear, very high stakes that went a long way to making New Vegas' story as widely beloved as it is.</p>
<p>Then again, I don't have to live with any of the online vitriol or boardroom frowning Fallout's showrunners might have to, if they were to go this route. We'll see which route they've gone on December 17th, when No-bark Noonan heroically emerges from the Lucky 38 to negotiate the first Mojave-wide peace agreement, having gotten Mr House to sign off on a clause which dictates all real-life lore-heads won't be forced to forget every New Vegas thing they've ever done.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-black-friday-deal-delivers-huge-pc-performance-from-a-tiny-desktop-unit-for-just-190-2000639063</link>
            <guid>1367353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The novelty of having a palm-sized desktop PC can wear off once you realize that, in terms of performance, it sort of just gets by. “Meh” is not the reaction you want to have for a brand-new desktop PC, even if it’s saving you money upfront. GMKtec’s G10 Mini PC is not a “meh” machine at all — it can outperform many of its bigger full-tower rivals and even some of the big-brand laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">It’s well worth the new Amazon Black Friday price of $219, which is 27% less than its full retail $300 tag for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>GMKtec has managed to stuff all sorts of goodies and useful features into this 2-pound package, starting with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor that can hit 3.7GHz when you put the pedal to the metal for multitasking, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe solid-state storage drive, and integrated Radeon Vega 8 graphics that’s powerful enough (1200 MHz) to run up to three external monitors. There’s also room under the hook to expand that RAM to 64GB and enough expansion slots and ports to drive the storage as high as 16TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Underdog Wins</h2>
<p>That AMD Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics might not grab your eye if you’re just skimming Amazon listings for Intel products. Which would be understandable since Intel is the gold standard for PC processors. But the Ryzen 5 3500U that’s at the heart of the GMKtec G10 has more than held its own in benchmark tests against Intel’s N-Series chips and often beats them, and for less money overall.</p>
<p>You can feel free to push the processor and the rest of the GMKtec G10 as hard as you want or need to, because all that hard work isn’t going to cause any internal meltdowns thanks to the tiny turbo cooling fan built into the mini PC’s body. That little fan can crank all day long, and do it quietly — 35 decibels, which is slightly louder than the sound of breathing.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The most important connections, of course, are the ones that get you on the internet, and the GMKtec G10 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 along with a super-fast 2.5GB Ethernet jack. From there the connections are all about expansion and the ability to turn the GMKtec G10 into the hub of your workstation, and in that regard it’s fully loaded — dual USB-A 3.2 ports in the front, and a full array in the back, including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with two USB-C ports (one for data) and another USB-A 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">Jumping at this limited-time Amazon deal taking 27% off the price of the GMKtec MIni PC</a> isn’t settling. It’s grabbing a more-than-proficient desktop PC that can run up to 3 external monitors and handle all of your workload and then some for a great price — it’s just $190 while this deal lasts.</p>

<p>LEGO continues to go in hard with collabs, creating exciting sets for all ages, many of which have been hit by significant price reductions in the Black Friday weekend sale.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios has announced the early access release date for Hytale, officially sparking the countdown for the release of the eagerly anticipated title.</p>



<p>Riot Games’ cancellation of Hytale looked to have left the game dead and buried, but it was repurchased by the original founders, with an affordable price to boot, and players will be able to play fairly soon.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-early-access-releases-january-13">Hytale Early Access Releases January 13</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on Twitter, the official account for <a href="https://x.com/Hytale/status/1994421030991904777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale announced</a> an early access release date of January 13 for the game, fulfilling a promise made to share the date by the end of this week.</p>



<p>Players had <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">already been fore</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">w</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">ar</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">n</a><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/1993830322006302889">ed</a> that a release before the holidays was not possible, as “the acquisition took just long enough” to prevent such a release, and that was why it took “so long to announce the date.”</p>



<p>Pre-orders will be available from December 13, though players have again been warned that the release is a “true early access” and is “very much unfinished and will be buggy for a while.”</p>



<p>The team is committed to “make Hytale the game we’ve always wanted it to be,” however, and it’s clear the early access release is just the next step on what has been a long journey for the team.</p>

            <p>N64 shoot-em-up Viewpoint 2064 was never released, but 25 years later a final version of the game is now playable thanks to game preservation efforts.</p>
<p>Originally published by Sammy (now part of Sega), the shooter is a follow up to the Neo Geo space shooter Viewpoint, switching its isometric perspective for something more akin to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>, or even Panzer Dragoon.</p>
<p>However, after being shown at Nintendo's Spaceworld event in 1999, the game mysteriously disappeared without a proper cancellation and was never released. It remains unclear why.</p>

<p>Still, back in 2020 game preservation YouTube channel Hard4Games received a beta version of the game. And now, a few years later, an apparently final "master" cart has been discovered and sent to the channel thanks to an anonymous individual.</p><p>As such, Hard4Games has released a new video comparing the two versions to show what the game would have been like had it been released. It's something of a hybrid of old school shmups and the 3D approach of Star Fox, with a viewpoint behind a spacecraft that travels into the screen but is unable to move up or down. It's got planet and space environments, big bosses, and branching progression.</p>
<p>Viewpoint 2064 has now been made <a href="https://archive.org/details/viewpoint-2064-master">available to download</a> and play, should anyone wish to check it out all these years later.</p>
<p>The original developer of the game was Racjin, formerly known as Racdym, which also made N64 series Snowboard Kids published by Atlus. It's now a support studio, having worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs">Fantasy Life i</a> most recently.</p>
<p>If you're still pining for the days of Star Fox on the N64, then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-fox-mans-new-game-wild-blue-looks-delightfully-deliriously-like-star-fox">Giles Goddard's forthcoming Wild Blue</a> will certainly tick the box - it's a brand new shooter heavily reminiscent of the Nintendo barrel roll simulator.</p>

			<p>A new trademark from Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment has players wondering if we're a little less than two weeks away from getting our first proper look at Control 2, the highly anticipated sequel to Remedy's excellent 2019 third-person action game, Control. Players are speculating that this new trademark for "<em>Control: Resonant</em>" is the title for the coming sequel, and that the timing of the trademark means we'll get to see it at The Game Awards 2025.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-trademark-control-resonant-unearthed-ahead-tga">MP1st</a>, the trademark was filed by Nordia Attorneys at Law Ltd. on November 27, 2025. According to MP1st, Nordia Attorneys at Law Ltd. is the legal firm Remedy works with for all their trademarks, which is what ties this trademark back to Remedy. The filing date is also significant because if we are getting a reveal at The Game Awards, then Remedy has likely pushed the filing as close to the event as possible to avoid leaks months in advance, instead of weeks.</p>



<p>The filing's tags also point to it being the game that Remedy fans have been waiting for since 2019, as they include "<em>video game services</em>." That said, they also include a tag for "<em>the production of entertainment in the form of TV series and cinematographic films</em>." That second tag creates a murkier picture of what this trademark could be for.</p>



<p>It could be that the trademark is for the video game Control 2, which will be called Control Resonant, and the tag for TV and film creation is future-proofing for Remedy to adapt its Control games into TV series and films. </p>



<p>However, that situation could be flipped. We already know that <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/">Remedy signed a deal with Annapurna Interactive,</a> which includes Annapurna helping to finance development on Control 2, and Remedy agreeing to work with Annapurna to develop a film and/or TV series adaptation.</p>



<p>So, this trademark could be for the coming TV series or film adaptation project Remedy is working with Annapurna on, which means that the "<em>video game services</em>" tag could be future-proofing in the opposite direction, from a film/TV series to a video game.</p>



<p>In March 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-full-production-remedy/">Remedy confirmed that Control 2 had entered full production</a>, which means that by the time we get to The Game Awards on December 11, it'll have been in full production for at least nine months. It's not impossible to believe that Remedy has also used that time to put together a trailer to showcase at the industry's largest end-of-year event.</p>



<p>It would also be an appropriate time to get a trailer for Control 2. With the game having only entered full production this year, we can't assume it'll be ready for 2026. But the trailers shown at The Game Awards are sometimes more than a year in advance of the game's release, so we are likely in for a few announcements that have a '2027' release window alongside them. Control 2 could very well be one of those trailers.</p>



<p>That historical precedent, paired with Remedy's financial goals for 2027 and 2030, <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-isnt-satisfied-recent-sales-remains-confident-significant-commercial-success/">as discussed in its most recent third-quarter financial report</a>, points to Remedy likely getting ready to ramp up marketing for its next projects. So, keep your eyes peeled for anything that looks or sounds Control-related at this year's show. It feels like we're getting closer to a proper return to the Oldest House.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-offloads-its-cheapest-model-ever-now-zero-profit-play-on-forerunner-55-gps-running-watch-2000648408</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Garmin is the number one brand of sports watches but their product range spans casual weekend joggers through professional ultramarathon athletes with vastly different feature needs and budgets. If spending $1,200 on the latest Fenix 8 feels excessive for your three-times-weekly runs, substantially cheaper alternatives deliver everything recreational athletes actually need.</p>
<p>The<strong> Forerunner 55</strong> is Garmin’s most affordable running watch and it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">currently costs $149 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $199</a>. This new record-low makes legitimate GPS running watches accessible at pricing that approached basic fitness bands before this sale, while delivering the core training features that transform casual jogging into structured improvement.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Daily Suggested Workouts</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive training recommendations look at your recent workouts</strong>, your current fitness level, and how well you’re recovering to suggest daily workouts of different levels of difficulty. The AI-powered suggestions help you avoid common training mistakes like getting hurt from overtraining or not making progress because you’re not putting in enough effort. After hard interval sessions, easy run days give your body time to recover while keeping your training consistent, which is what really makes you fitter. Instead of giving vague advice,<strong> the workouts set clear goals for pace, duration, and intensity</strong>.</p>



<p>The GPS tracking shows the <strong>exact distance, pace, and route using satellite positioning</strong> which is much more accurate than phone-based tracking that has to deal with power-saving problems and signal drops. The watch keeps track of your real path instead of using step counting algorithms that make mistakes when you turn or go up or down. After a run, maps show exact routes and color-coded pace analysis shows where you sped up or slowed down, revealing patterns that were hard to see during the run.</p>
<p>The <strong>two-week battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> means you don’t have to charge it every night, which makes fitness trackers feel like they need a lot of care and attention. Wear it all the time to keep track of all your activities and sleep without having to charge it every day. The GPS mode lasts for 20 hours, which is enough for ultra-distance events or several weeks of training between charges.</p>
<p>The <strong>PacePro feature gives you GPS-based pace advice for planned courses</strong> or target distances: It helps you plan your race day strategy by giving you personalized pacing that takes into account changes in elevation and how much energy you have. Enter your goal finish time, and the watch will figure out how much you need to change your pace for hills: This will help you keep up a steady effort that keeps you from getting too excited too soon and bonking late in the race.</p>



<p>The activity profile includes a wide <strong>range of running styles such as track and trail running, as well as cycling, swimming, HIIT, yoga, and strength training</strong>. This variety allows for cross-training, which is important for preventing injuries. The watch can tell when you’re moving in different ways and uses the right tracking algorithms to keep track of your pool swim laps and figure out your cycling cadence from your wrist movement.</p>
<p>Advanced wellness monitoring goes beyond just tracking workouts: It<strong> includes all-day heart rate and respiration tracking, sleep analysis, and Body Battery energy monitoring</strong>. Stress tracking shows how daily life affects recovery, and sleep scoring measures the quality of sleep by looking at movement and heart rate variability. The Body Battery metric combines information about your stress, activity, and sleep into a single energy score that can help you figure out when is the best time to work out.</p>
<p>At $149, Garmin’s entry-level running watch is the cheapest it’s ever been on Black Friday – and it’s cheaper than many basic fitness bands that don’t have GPS or structured training features. If you want to improve your running without spending four figures, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson’s Heater and Fan Combo Hits a 40% Black Friday Low, Practically a Christmas Gift for an All-Season Appliance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-just-slashed-its-hotcool-am09-jet-focus-heater-and-fan-by-200-practically-giving-it-away-2000648205</link>
            <guid>1367296</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter is here, and if you’re anything like me, a central heating system (and multiple layers of socks) won’t be enough to warm those hands and feet up. You need something with an amplified airflow for both personal and whole-room heating. The Dyson Hot+Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan does that job well, and its dual functionality makes it great for year-round use.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, like most other Dyson appliances, this one isn’t exactly the most affordable at $500, but thankfully, you don’t have to pay the full price today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">A 40% Black Friday discount has dropped the price to just $300, letting you save a whopping $200 for a short time.</a> The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime users, but it could end soon. Get this sleek fan while the discount is live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional for Year-Round Comfort</h2>
<p>The fan uses Air Multiplier technology to deliver an uninterrupted stream of smooth airflow in both hot and cool modes. In winter, the ceramic plates heat up quick to deliver the cozy warmth your body needs, while the amplified airflow cools you down fast in hot weather, making it great to use any time of the year; snow or shine.</p>
<p>There are two airflow modes to choose from; Jet Focus and Diffused. The former directs the air at you, so it’s great for when you want the warmth or breeze to yourself. Diffused mode, on the other hand, gently cools/heats the entire room by oscillating at a 70-degree angle. Just came in after spending time with friends on a chilly evening? Warm those freezing hands up with the Focus mode. Once your body temperature is back up, you can switch to Diffused mode for even warmth all around. Changing modes is quick, thanks to the included remote that attaches magnetically to the Dyson hot plus hot for easy storage.</p>



<p>Those planning to use it at night will appreciate the built-in sleep timer that automatically turns the thing off after pre-set intervals. These can be anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours. Temperature ranges from 32°F to 98.6°F, meaning you won’t be stuck with a narrow range as with most traditional heaters and coolers. Before dozing off, set your ideal temperature, switch to the Diffused mode (unless you want to feel like you’re in the Sahara in winters or the North Pole in summers), and pick a timer setting. Taking a quick nap? 20 minutes should do. Calling it a day? Go ahead and set it for five or six hours. Since there are no blades involved, it operates fairly quietly, as well. Just note that it’s not cordless, so you’ll need to place it somewhere near an outlet.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a heating and cooling solution with different operating modes and a wide temperature range, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider. It provides you with the warmth and breeze you need, exactly how you want it to be delivered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">We recommend it even at its not-so-friendly $500 price tag, but the current $200 discount makes the upgrade quite affordable.</a> It’s also important to note that such massive drops tend to wrap up quickly, especially with the holiday rush kicking in. We highly suggest locking the discount in without wasting much time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[At $0.02 Per GB, WD 5TB My Passport External Hard Drive Leaves No Margin on the Table]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/backup-your-data-with-a-5tb-external-hard-drive-for-just-125-for-black-friday-2000647687</link>
            <guid>1367284</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday here, tons of deals have now gone live across the web. If you’re trying to save some cash on some upgrades to your kitchen, some new toys, or some new tech, now’s the time to get shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/">If you’re in need of more storage with your computer, Amazon has the WD 5TB My Passport Ultra external hard drive one sale for up to 19% off.</a> There are multiple size options to choose from, but the only ones part of the ongoing deal is the 2TB, the 4TB, and the 5TB. The 2TB has come down by $10 to just $80. The 4TB has come down by $15 to $125. However, the 5TB has come down by a significant $30 which also brings it to just $125. So there’s no reason to go with the 4TB right now as you can get an extra 1TB of storage for the same price.</p>
<p>This external hard drive is a great way to expand your device’s storage capacity quickly and easily. The My Passport Ultra can connect to your laptop or PC over USB-C. In order to ensure compatibility with older machines, a USB-A adapter is included.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6037/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The drive is made to be durable and travel friendly. It has a sleek exterior casing made from anodized metal, offering your stored data protection when on the go.</p>
<p>Do note that this is a hard drive, not a solid state drive. Western Digital doesn’t list the exact specs for read and write speeds of its My Passport Ultra external hard drive, but don’t expect it to compare to the speeds of some newer SSDs. If you’re someone who finds themselves working on massive creative projects like editing video, this likely won’t be sufficient for you. It can still provide utility as a backup for your projects, but I wouldn’t recommended working directly from it for big videos timelines.</p>
<p>Likewise, this hard drive isn’t meant for gaming. Modern AAA titles require some pretty fast load times, so you won’t have any luck trying to play games from this. It’s also not compatible with consoles, using it with your PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. It may work with older consoles, or even simply for game storage with the the current generation stuff. Some external hard drives are able to be formatted to store PS5 or Xbox Series X games, but require that you move them back to your internal storage in order to play them. Though, again, Western Digital makes no mention of gaming here on the product page so your mileage may vary with this one.</p>



<h2>Scheduled Backups</h2>
<p>It seems this drive is primarily geared toward those in need of some place to backup their files. The included Acronis True Image for Western Digital allows you to even schedule backups. You can just keep the hard drive plugged into your laptop or PC and have it backup your files at regularly scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>The hard driver is equipped with security features which help protect against ransomware. You can fortify your important applications and help prevent data loss from ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>If you’re worried about someone malicious getting their hands on your files, or simply would feel a better peace of mind if no one could access but you. you can enable password protection at the hard drive level. You data will be locked behind a password of your choice with 256-bit AES hardware encryption.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Survival Unit - the mobile strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series - has passed 2m downloads in just 10 days.</p>
<p>In a press release, co-developers Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation stated the game had "achieved outstanding global results" since its debut on 18th November.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>To mark this milestone, the studios are now offering Resident Evil Survival Unit players a "special in-game reward". To claim, players will need to enter the code '2m Survivors' into the promo code redemption site.</p>
<p>The Resi spin-off has been created in close collaboration with the main series' developer Capcom. As for what it is all about, Resident Evil Survival Unit kicks off with the protagonist in a "mysterious" hospital, having been used as an Umbrella test subject. "As you uncover the truth and attempt to escape, the story unfolds into a parallel world where original characters from the original series return," the official blurb teases, promising a "chilling new narrative".</p>
<p>Series regulars such as Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong and Claire Redfield all pop up for the mobile release.</p>
<p>To compare this figure with other mainline Resident Evil mobile releases, back in 2024, it was said that sales of Resident Evil 7 on iOS had flopped, having been bought by under 2000 people. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">the free-to-start game had been downloaded 83,000 times in 10 days</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has certainly stolen the hearts of minds of gamers this season, remaining incredibly popular weeks after its explosive launch. In fact, Arc Raiders is proving to have such a steadfast place in the zeitgeist that it made an appearance in this week's South Park episode.</p>
<p>The story of how it happened comes from LinkedIn no less, <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/aakstg/">as marketing lead Ashley St. Germain took to the social media platform</a> to share the tale. According to Germain the creators of South Park contacted Embark Studios on Monday, asking for permission to use the game in an upcoming episode. Embark agreed.</p>
<p>Sending over footage of the game for South Park to use the following day, Arc Raiders appeared this Wednesday in the episode titled 'Turkey Trot'. In it Tolkien is seen glued to the extraction shooter, while South Park's annual Turkey Trot finds itself in dire need of money, having to look to Saudi Arabia for funding. This, funnily enough, is also something the video game industry is no stranger to.</p>

<p>This is far from the first time South Park has shown video games some love. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-park-offers-wow-trial">There was the legendary episode 'Make Love, not Warcraft'</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/uvphu3/a_quick_mention_of_mgs_5_in_south_parks_2013/">Metal Gear Solid 5</a>, and Guitar Hero. There are also a selection of pretty good South Park games, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, which reviewer Dan Whitehead wrote was: "A decent RPG wrapped up in a grossly hilarious licence, South Park will be remembered more for its gags than its gameplay."</p><p>Arc Raiders, it seems, will continue its life in the spotlight for a while longer. It only recently released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-patch-removes-weapon-swap-exploit">patch fixing some of the games' biggest problems</a>, including a quick swap exploit that was throwing a wrench into close-ranged fights.</p>

            <guid>1367263</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's no secret that Bungie's mammoth shooter, Destiny 2, the game that used to be one of the exemplary models for other publishers on how to build a live service game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-selling-worse-than-expected-sony-records-impairment-loss/">has been struggling</a>. Players know it, people who follow games but don't play Destiny 2 know it, and of course, Bungie knows it. However, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-dont-want-to-be-a-dead-game-destiny-2s-directors-on-reassessing-the-shooters-future">IGN</a>, game director Tyson Green and core creative director Ben Wommack spoke about how they believe they can build a strong future for the game, starting with Destiny 2: Renegades.</p>



<p>Green was up front with what he believes happened following the conclusion of The Final Shape. While the expansion was, overall, a well-received ending to a decade-long saga, the drop-off in players that followed wasn't exactly part of the plan, and the release of Destiny 2's last expansion, Edge of Fate, didn't help bring players back.</p>



<p>"<em>The Final Shape brought things to a crescendo, where it's like a fantastic ending that tied off a lot of threads,</em>" said Green. "<em>People were pleased and satisfied with what they played, and then the big [downwards] spike in population [came after]. That happened because we ended the saga. So you get what you pay for, right?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>That wasn't the plan from the business perspective. We still want to keep making Destiny; we still have many stories to tell in this universe. There are still lots of things to do, and we have to keep building the game. Unfortunately, it was not gracefully managed, but we had to try something.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PqicEwg2qEc?start=144&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Continuing on about the Edge of Fate expansion, Green said, "<em>We looked at the problem we had [after The Final Shape], and we said, 'We think there's a route here,' which is leaning into more systems of pursuit, getting new tiers of gear, armor sets, and power progression, and things like challenge customization. These things that can allow a core audience of players to really say, like, 'I'm really gonna take this game and put it through its paces, and get good rewards for it.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>It sounds great on paper, but it didn't work. I think we've been taught a bunch of hard lessons about what our players want, and there are really two kinds of live games: those that listen to the players and respond, and those that don't. And we don't want to be a dead live game, we want to keep building Destiny. So we're listening to our players, and what our players are telling us is that they don't want to chase a simple number that goes up, they want real rewards</em>."</p>



<p>According to Green and Wommack, the listening and adapting to what their players are asking for begins with Destiny 2's upcoming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, which is releasing on December 2, 2025.</p>



<p>The studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-destiny-2-renegades-expansion-ahead-of-launch-next-week/">showcased the expansion in more detail earlier this week</a> ahead of its upcoming launch, showing off new elements of the game, including the syndicates, new weapons like the Blasters, and the lightsaber-inspired Praxic Blades. According to Wommack, elements like the Praxic Blade are a sign of Bungie pushing outside its "<em>usual boundaries</em>" for Destiny 2, while Green affirms that Renegades is "<em>still fundamentally a Destiny expansion</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>When you're making something new, you often have a bunch of conventions and boundaries that you have to consider, especially for games that have</em> <em>been around for a long time like Destiny</em>," said Wommack. "<em>It's tempting to stick to those conventions as being the boundaries of the rules, but the truth is that you need to re-examine all of them every single time when trying to really create something special and make a splash. This is especially true when working with Lucasfilm.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We looked at how we made the sandbox stuff we've done, we now have blaster weapons that will stay with us going forward, seeing how the Praxic Blade turned out, and we have the various new syndicates that turned out well. There are things that we definitely wouldn't have done, but we had to accept and push past those usual boundaries to do these things, and as long as it's still fun and people are responding to it, the feel is there,</em> <em>then it's the right decision</em>."</p>



<p>It's good to hear that directors like Green and Wommack feel confident in their thinking with how they are trying to chart Destiny 2's path forward, but how players respond to Renegades when it arrives in a few days will be a turning point for the franchise. Even if it's a massive success, there's still an argument to be made that Bungie would be better off moving on from Destiny 2, to try and move the series forward in a new way.</p>



<p>Perhaps that's why we're seeing rumors appear about <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-3-in-extremely-early-development-according-to-bungie-leakers/">Bungie working on Destiny 3</a>, because the studio is aware that, after over a decade of Destiny since its release in 2014, and nearly a decade of Destiny 2 being the face of the series, it's time to move on to something new. Renegades being a success along the way would definitely be a nice boost for the company, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-player-count-steam-record-low-ahead-of-star-wars-expansion-bungie/">considering how much the game has been struggling</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">considering all the internal problems</a> Bungie has, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">even with its non-Destiny titles</a>, a fresh start, or at least an attempt at one, feels inevitable.</p>



<p>At least it sounds like Bungie is open to trying for one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Pushes Anker’s 3-in-1 MagSafe Charger to a Record Low Amid a Wave of Apple Deals, Despite Being Newly Released]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cut-down-on-cable-clutter-with-this-3-in-1-prime-magsafe-charger-for-apple-devices-2000648208</link>
            <guid>1367251</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Topping all your essentials up in one go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done dealing with cable clutter and plugging different devices into different outlets across the room, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of our favorite charging solutions, and this Black Friday is a great time to upgrade your setup with one for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">Right now, Apple users can grab its 3-in-1 Prime MagSafe Charger for iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods for just $150, down from $230</a>. You’re saving an impressive 35% on a wireless charging solution that’s safe to use, plus much faster and efficient than other options in the same range. It’s also its lowest price we have seen on it since launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smart, Plus Powerful</h2>
<p>The 25W ultra-fast charging makes it around 6 times faster than most similar options out there, while TEC cooling keeps heat-related slowdowns at bay. An iPhone 17 Pro can hit 50% in just 22 minutes, so it’s much quicker than a standard charger. Support for iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch means you can juice all three up without the usual wait and clutter. Just toss them on before dozing off, and wake up to everything ready to take on the day with you. It also makes it great for when you’re in a rush and don’t have the time to plug everything in separately. Best of all, you won’t forget any of them, since all will be sitting right there next to each other.</p>
<p>The phone charger is flexible, and you can place your iPhone both horizontally and vertically; however you like. Planning to watch something at it charges? Go for the horizontal mode and let it double as a stand. There’s a built-in 1.65-inch HD display on the charging station to keep you in the loop about power, temperature, and charging status. The screen is customizable, and even shares safety alerts if something feels off.</p>



<p>Three power modes deliver different power levels for different routines. Boost Mode offers high-power charging for quick top-ups, and the Ice Mode keeps the devices cool as you use them while they charge. Finally, the Sleep Mode disables cooling and dims the display for quiet, safe overnight charging. Switching between the modes is made easy with the dedicated app, which also lets you schedule day and night times to enter or exit the sleep mode automatically. You can use it to customize your screensaver and view charging details just as well.</p>
<p>ActiveShield 5.0 performs over 10 million temperature checks a day to prevent overheating and maintain the battery health of your devices. As for compatibility, the charger plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17, almost all the old and new Apple Watch series, plus AirPods 2, 3, 4, Pro, Pro2, and Pro 3. Just note that it’s not compatible with iPhone 16e. The box comes with the charger itself, a 65W GaN foldable adapter, a 5 ft USB-C to USB-C cable (10,000-bend tested), a welcome guide, 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind. That’s everything you need to get started with it right away.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a smarter, no-fuss charging solution for all your important gadgets, this 3-in-1 Anker Prime MagSafe charger does a great job at that. It provides the power they need, plus maintains your battery health while it’s at it. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">This deal takes $80 off its $230 price, letting you grab it for just $150.</a> The offer applies to both white and black color options, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Review—The Ultimate Extraction Shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-review-ultimate-extraction-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1367245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the most divisive games of all time. It has suffered under the weight of controversy, been spoiled senselessly by swathes of cheaters, and, at times, proven to be an elating title that has spearheaded the growth of one of the most exciting genres in modern gaming.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games recently pushed Escape from Tarkov into a state of graduation, moving from a ten-year alpha and beta cycle into the very long-awaited 1.0 version that’s now occupying the market and dominating the genre once again.</p>



<p>What follows is my comprehensive Escape from Tarkov review, compiled after five years of playing this punishing extraction shooter and, along with hundreds of thousands of others, finally reaching version 1.0.</p>







<h2 id="h-escape-from-tarkov-is-a-rollercoaster">Escape from Tarkov is a Rollercoaster</h2>



<p>‘Rollercoaster’ was one of the first words that came to mind when I was thinking about how to sum up all that Escape from Tarkov is. It’s a tumultuous, emotional cacophony of a title that will leave you feeling ecstatic after a phenomenal raid, then will happily send you plummeting into a pit of despair after a brutal failure.</p>



<p>It’ll have you reaping the rewards of a solid streak of resolving quests and winning fights, then have you ruing the day you invested in the game and cursing all that Battlestate Games holds dear after being devastated by a cheater while on a banger of a run.</p>



<p>From tasks that take mere seconds to challenges that only 0.01% of players will ever achieve, Escape from Tarkov has one of the most diverse spectrums in gaming history, but regardless of which end you’re sitting on, one thing remains axiomatic: this is not a game for the faint of heart.</p>



<p>In the ten years that Escape from Tarkov has been in development, we’ve seen immense overhauls that have changed the face of the game, and crushing blows dealt by the community and the team behind the title that have left the extraction shooter in shambles. It probably has one of the most storied lifecycles <strong>ever</strong>, and that’s not an exaggeration.</p>



<p>Love it or hate it, Escape from Tarkov has <strong>aura</strong>.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Play as a PMC or a ‘Scav’ character; the result is often the same…</figcaption></figure>







<p>Without the success of Escape from Tarkov, the extraction shooter bubble, which continues to grow as you read this, wouldn’t be anywhere near the size that it is today. Escape from Tarkov’s monumental and generational run began around 2020, when streamers contributed to the mass popularization of the game.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, this intriguing, hyper-challenging, and borderline milsim game from a mysterious Russian developer started taking over social and streaming platforms, and everyone was switched on to something <strong>new and terrifying</strong>: a genre where a single bullet can mean the loss of absolutely everything.</p>



<p>Over the years, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-beaten-to-steam-arena-breakout-infinite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many challenges have arisen</a> to face Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but while they’ve come and gone, the pioneering title has remained firmly at the top of the table. It’s only in recent months, with the arrival of games like ARC Raiders, that worthy competitors have surfaced.</p>



<p>In the last ten years, the face of Escape from Tarkov has drastically changed. New maps have been introduced, and old maps have been expanded. The game’s arsenal has swollen to epic proportions, and the quest list has grown in kind. More traders have been added, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-tempus-campionum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer arena spin-off</a> was released (and synced up), and the game’s core mechanics have been upgraded, altered, and adapted time and time again.</p>



<p>The complexity of Escape from Tarkov is reflected in that journey. This isn’t an arcade shooter where you have stacks of ammunition, can slide around the map, and will regenerate your health if you stay out of combat. This is something much more punishing, and that presents a barrier to casual gamers – but still, Escape from Tarkov has greatly succeeded in the face of that potential blocker.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-challenging-but-incredibly-rewarding">Tarkov is Challenging, But Incredibly Rewarding</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is <strong>supposed to be </strong>extremely difficult. Aside from the fact that Battlestate Games has pushed the envelope in terms of realism and survival elements, the game’s lore has characters left behind after an evacuation of a war zone, which results in a desperate fight just to stay alive and scrape by with whatever resources can be looted or bought.</p>



<p>To that end, players must suit up, load into a map, fight other players and AI enemies, complete quests, secure loot, and finally, extract from that map. If they fail to get out in time or are killed by any entity, they lose everything they took in and everything that they found during the raid. That’s the core gameplay loop, and it’s not for everyone (but what game is?)</p>



<p>Healing mechanics are intricate and require working knowledge of different solutions, from tourniquets and splints to bandages and painkillers. The game’s ballistics and weapon handling mechanics are so granular that using a sub-par type of ammunition in a particular magazine attached to a certain gun can mean the difference between a kill and armor eating up your shots.</p>



<p>In terms of deeper immersion, players can loot resources to build up a hideout that gives them various benefits, all while working through skill paths that have rewards the higher the player ascends through them. There’s a lot to soak up, and this is only scratching the surface, which I feel is fully indicative of what’s in store for new Escape from Tarkov players.</p>



<p>There are no maps with markers, no guiding lines to follow, and no icons above your teammates’ heads. You don’t have a UI telling you how much ammunition you have left, and you have a finite amount of space in your pockets and backpack, so inventory management is another metagame to conquer.</p>



<p>If you’re not put off yet by the compelling complexity of Escape from Tarkov, then read on – we’re only going deeper.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-look-the-feel-the-atmosphere">The Look, The Feel, The Atmosphere</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Escape from Tarkov’s boss characters only increase the struggle…</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is a good-looking game, provided you have a powerful enough PC to run it correctly. It has all the bells and whistles of graphical customization you’d expect, and it offers a fairly diverse array of maps that feature what you might refer to as ‘biomes’. For instance, there are two maps themed around the concept of heavy forests, while another is a sprawling city. There’s a map that’s a tight-knit factory environment, and another that’s a coastline with a huge industrial influence.</p>



<p>There are night raids, which are almost suffocating in how much they increase the game’s difficulty level, and day raids, both of which can be impacted by a rotation of weather effects <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-btr-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and a ‘season system’</a> that changes from winter to spring, to summer, and to fall.</p>



<p>Each of those seasons has unique attributes. In the winter, crunchy snow lines your boots and presents a horrific inability to camouflage yourself. In the fall, trees and bushes are stripped of their leaves, offering less cover, and in the spring, noisy rain deafens you.</p>



<p>These seasons are delivered in addition to regular updates, which, before the 1.0 release of Escape from Tarkov, were known as ‘wipes’. These global resets would, every six months or so, push players back to a clean slate, allowing everyone to rebuild over and over again. In lieu of that going forward, Battlestate Games has promised seasons to remain consistent, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLC-based expansions</a> will also be released.</p>



<p>But back to the atmosphere of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>When it all works properly, the sound, dynamic weather, visuals, and effects are sublime. If you get trapped in a high-octane, energetic gunfight in Escape from Tarkov, you’ll come away with your heart pounding and your hands shaking. However, over the years, plenty of issues have surfaced with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-patch-overhauls-immersive-audio/">the game’s audio</a> and performance that have left players, more often than you’d like, with a sour taste in their mouths.</p>



<p>In Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 update, Battlestate Games included hundreds of improvements, bug fixes, and overhauls to various elements of the game, like the UI and trader interactions, trying desperately to boost the game into a space where very little was wrong with it.</p>



<p>They mostly succeeded, but nothing is perfect, and that includes the most popular extraction shooter ever made.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-on-offer-in-escape-from-tarkov">What’s on Offer in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov represents hundreds of hours of potential. It’s a lengthy game, and you never know which way any raid will end up going. As you die so much, you’ll likely spend longer than expected resolving a single quest, and that naturally stretches things out a bit.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-story-will-have-four-endings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">core storyline added with 1.0</a> is <strong>huge </strong>and sits nicely alongside side missions and daily and weekly objectives given to you by the game’s traders.</p>



<p>You can play with friends in Escape from Tarkov, or run solo, but it’s a game that’s always better with people by your side. It can become a horror game when playing solo, as the silence around you is suddenly shattered by a single shot that takes the top of your head off. As you explore Escape from Tarkov, you’ll come to appreciate that at least 100 hours are needed to fully comprehend the game’s mechanics, maps, and the core gameplay loop, and that’s not a joke.</p>



<p>It’s by no means a game that you can play if you don’t have much time on your hands. If you load into a raid on Streets of Tarkov, for instance, and you stay there for the duration, that one run will cost you up to an <strong>hour </strong>off your life, if you include loading and preparation times.</p>



<p>But that’s just another example of the meat on the bones of Escape from Tarkov. Sure, that meat can sometimes be a little rotten, and the AI might not always function correctly, or you might run into a cheater, but many feel that the game is still worth playing, as those delightful highs combat the crushing lows so nicely.</p>



<p>And at the end of the day, if you don’t want to experience Escape from Tarkov from a PvP perspective and fight other players, you can invest a little more and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obtain the PvE product</a>, which is <strong>the exact same game</strong>, but exclusively populated with AI enemies.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-escape-from-tarkov-worth-it">Is Escape from Tarkov Worth It?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Are you ready for the unparalleled atmosphere?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov is one of the most confusing games I’ve ever played. I’ve fallen in and out of love with it, it has given me intense anxiety (like, legitimate heart-racing anxiety), and it has introduced me to some great folks over the years. I’ve hated it, I’ve adored it with an immense passion, and I’ve gone so far as to get a piece of it inked on my skin for life.</p>



<p>I’ve also put €400 into Battlestate Games’ coffers because I’ve upgraded my ‘edition’ of the game so many times.</p>



<p>But for all the negativity and controversy (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-unheard-edition-escape-from-tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read: The Unheard Edition</a>), Escape from Tarkov remains a phenomenal experience that can absolutely alter your vision of the games you know and love. Before Escape from Tarkov, I was a Call of Duty and Battlefield fan, but this extraction shooter loop filled me with a desire to seek out a greater challenge and understand the breadth of this game’s complexity.</p>



<p>If you have a PC (because Tarkov <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t on console <em>yet</em></a>), you have most likely <strong>considered </strong>playing Escape from Tarkov. Now that the 1.0 version is out and represents a full, finished product, <strong>and </strong>it’s on Steam, it’s officially the best time to start playing the game. Bear in mind that you’re letting yourself in for something extremely unwelcoming, and you should do just fine.</p>







<h2 id="h-verdict-5-5-masterpiece">Verdict = 5/5 (Masterpiece)</h2>



<p>I might be biased, as I have around 2,000 hours in Escape from Tarkov, but even with <strong>zero hours played</strong>, I could identify that this is the ultimate extraction shooter. In that space, it’s a household name, and it has stood above all others and weathered everything thrown at it. The graduation to 1.0 is nothing but a representation of the diehard dedication Battlestate Games has poured into this title over the last decade, and it’s a wonderful thing to behold as a long-time fan of the game.</p>



<p>Through thick and thin, Escape from Tarkov has prevailed. It’s an enormous, deep, and rich game that’s still evolving, it offers unparalleled emotional experiences, and it looks, sounds, and feels great while doing all that. It’s the most punishing game you’ll ever play, but if you put enough hours into understanding this gem of a title, you’ll come to appreciate that it is a generational masterpiece of the extraction shooter market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-drop-to-its-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647626</link>
            <guid>1367236</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Black Friday happening, retailers have push the go button in the backend of their websites to have all their deals go live right now, ahead of schedule. If you’re still hunting for the right gift this holiday season for a friend, family member, or loved one, right now seems to be the best time to do so. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon happens to have Google’s latest noise-cancelling premium earbuds—the Pixel Buds Pro 2— on sale for its lowest price yet</a>. The in-ear headphones and charging case normally clock in at $229, but ahead of November’s massive sales days, the price has come down to just $169. That 26% discount ends up saving you a whole $60 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in five different color option, three of which are lucky enough to be part of the ongoing early Black Friday sale. You can chose between hazel, peony, or porcelain. Wintergreen and moonstone are either out of stock or absent from the discount. The color you choose only affects the buds themselves, as all color options come with the same white case with black interior.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>These earbuds are being toted by Google as its most comfortable earbuds yet. They are small, light, and have a secure fit in any ear size or shape. You can use a twist-to-adjust stabilizer which locks your earbuds in place which is great for a high-intensity workout. Then twist the other way to loosen them a bit for all-day comfort.</p>
<p>What separates the Pro model from the standard Pixel Buds is support for noise cancellation. The Buds Pro 2 are able to silence unwanted sounds from your surroundings so you can focus in only hearing only what you want to hear, be it music, a podcast, or audiobook. Active noise cancellation is enhanced further with the help of Googles Silent Seal 2.0 which is able to cancel up to twice as much noise as the original Buds Pro.</p>



<h2>Conversation Detection</h2>
<p>Now what happened when you don’t want to eliminate those environmental sounds anymore? Like maybe you’ve been waiting in line for Starbucks—kicking it to “Radio” by Bershy on loop, which you discovered from the awesome soundtrack of <em>Dispatch</em>—and now you’re up next to order. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> are equipped with Conversation Detection. This will automatically pause your music and switch your earbuds to transparency mode when you start talking. Transparency mode basically filters in outside sounds in through the in-ear speakers, and you can activate it just by speaking. That means you don’t have to take out you earbuds, nor do you even need to awkward hold or tap while trying to strike up a conversation.</p>
