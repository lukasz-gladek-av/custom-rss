			<p>The core concept of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is utterly bonkers. You and your opponents leap from a plane, circling hundreds of miles above the ground. None of you have parachutes though, and instead you willingly freefall to your doom. As you plummet, you must shoot your fellow plummeters with your magic finger gun – yes, really. Your objective is to kill them all before you hit the ground. Oh, and your player character is called Smoke Wallace. He has purple skin and magical powers because he was bitten by the same radioactive dragon that ate all of his family. You see? Bonkers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aerial_Knight's DropShot - Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/akOVT_R3QXY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bright and garish, the visuals are all acid-soaked kaleidoscopic weirdness. It’s not my kind of thing, but this game certainly has a striking and attention-grabbing look. Gameplay is structured around small levels that last for sixty seconds, Dropshot is gaming for the TikTok generation. Each level is intended as a dopamine hit but to be quickly forgotten. As you fall from a first-person perspective, you’ll need to dodge floating islands, laser traps and your opponents’ return fire to stay alive, and with only two lives, this can be challenging. Kill efficiently and stylishly and you’ll rack up points and a high grade, the idea being to return to each level numerous times to hit a high score and achieve a perfect run. The problem is, that despite the bonkers premise and over the top visuals, the gameplay itself is rather pedestrian, leaving me with little interest in returning to a level once it was done.</p>



<p>The biggest issue is speed; there’s little sense of any. As you hurtle through the sky, it should be an adrenaline rush, like knee-sliding in Platinum Games’ Vanquish, or hurtling round a tight corner far too fast in F-Zero. Instead, it’s more akin to strolling to the shops to buy some bread. This is an oddly muted experience, rather than dodging floating islands and traps by the skin of your teeth, you seem to have a veritable age to gently steer yourself out of the way.</p>

<p>Achieving a high score amounts to little more than the eye-straining task of having to spot your tiny freefalling opponents in the distance, slowly line up a shot, and take them out. You’ll likely fail to spot them all on the first attempt, forcing you to attempt the level numerous times to catch them. Often your foes will kill you first, but you’ll have little idea that a bullet is coming. One moment you’re alive, the next you’re dead, with little to no visual clues that an attack is incoming. Worse, the collision detection isn’t great – possibly due to the challenges of basing the game around a first-person view – meaning sometimes you die, sometimes you survive, and you’re really not sure why.</p>
<p>There are two other game modes. The first is a boss battle that sees you fighting an enormous dragon, a nasty fella who can absorb a whole lot of damage, forcing you to conserve your ammo and keep a look out for ammunition drops to fall through. This is certainly more enjoyable than the main game. Primarily because it resolves the issue of the irritating unseen enemy attacks, as the dragon blasts you with big obvious fireballs that must be quickly shot from the sky, bringing some old-school light gun game shenanigans to proceedings.</p>

<p>The final mode is a straight up race between you and your rival to catch a golden egg before you hit the ground. This does, finally, get the pulse racing, as due to numerous speed boosters things end up fast and frantic. Darting through arrays of laser beams, narrowly avoiding chunks of rock, finally I can see what the development team were going for. If these thrills and spills could be replicated throughout the rest of the game, then Aerial Knight’s Dropshot would be an absolute indie banger. As it is, there’s just too many of the boring levels getting in the way of the good stuff.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Just like with its bizarre setting and over-the-top visuals, the overall experience of Aerial Knight’s Dropshot is uneven. There’s complete brilliance in places, such as the thrilling races, but they come alongside some rather uninspired and borderline frustrating combat. If I could just have a game full of the rival chases, and get rid of the fighting, this would be terrific. As it is, it’s alright.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This weekend, Polish developer <strong>Bloober Team</strong> unveiled <strong>Layers of Fear 3</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pASWkDkyaY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a special event celebrating the horror franchise's 10th anniversary</a>. Bloober Team founder and CEO <strong>Piotr Babieno</strong> appeared to discuss <strong>the great importance of Layers of Fear for the studio</strong>:</p>



<p><em>For Bloober Team, Layers of Fear isn't just a title from our past. It marked the moment when we understood what kind of studio we want to be, what type of games we want to create. Tonight, we want to honor that legacy and show you that Layers of Fear is still alive, still evolving, and still finding new ways to haunt.</em></p>



<p>Then, Creative Director and Lead Designer <strong>Mateusz Lenart</strong> spoke about the philosophy behind these horror games:</p>



<p><em>Layers of Fear was imagined as a tribute to artists and a thin line between inspiration and obsession. Creativity can be both beautiful and destructive while shaped by ambition and the fear of failure. Our goal was to show that by placing the player inside of an artist's unraveling mind, we invite empathy rather than judgment, changing horror into a deeply human experience.</em></p>



<p><em>When we started making the game in 2015, we were a team of around 20 people. It was a very personal project for us, and everyone put their own inspirations and experiences into the game's art style and narrative themes. We are extremely grateful that the game resonated with so many people throughout the years. Layers of Fear is the game for the artist within you. And as every artistic journey, the deeper you go into it, the more you discover about yourself. </em></p>



<p>Babieno then announced that the original soundtrack <strong>will be made available on both CD and vinyl</strong>. Moreover, they unveiled a partnership with <strong>Foksal Publishing Group</strong> to create <strong>novels</strong> based on the Layers of Fear franchise, starting with one written by <strong>Marta Bijan</strong> and scheduled for release in <strong>late 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>However, for gamers, the juiciest announcement came right at the end of the livestream: a teaser for Layers of Fear 3.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's clearly early days still. The studio recently released <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cronos-the-new-dawn-such-is-our-calling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: New Dawn</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is remaking Silent Hill 1</a></strong>, after <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doing a great job with Silent Hill 2</a></strong>.</p>

            <p>There's nothing more spooky than having to neatly get your message across in a limited number of words which may or may not have to rhyme or stick to iambic pentameter. That's something Polish horror devs Bloober Team clearly understand, since they whipped out some William Blake poetry over the weekend, in order to reveal that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a> 3 will be a thing.</p>

<p>The folks behind 2024's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> used this reveal to close out a Valentines' weekend showcase commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Layers of Fear series, which kicked off with 2016's Layers of Fear. In this cinematic teaser for the next entry, a creepy bloke creepily read through Blake's The Sick Rose while sitting in a creepy chair surrounded by creepy portraits, one of which was of a strange hairless creature with no nose and two pointed fangs. The poem goes <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43682/the-sick-rose">as follows</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Rose thou art sick.</p>
<p>The invisible worm,</p>
<p>That flies in the night</p>
<p>In the howling storm:</p>
<p>Has found out thy bed</p>
<p>Of crimson joy:</p>
<p>And his dark secret love</p>
<p>Does thy life destroy</p></blockquote>
<p>Midway through the creepy bloke's reading, one of the paintings falls off the wall. Rather than blaming shoddy sticking apparatus, the man instead said: "Don't you worry about my little friend there, he tries to help. But the poor thing hasn't quite got the hang of the afterlife yet."</p><p>The teaser ended with the creepy bloke getting creepily serious for a second and turning over an hourglass. Sadly, there was no indication of when Layers of Fear 3 might arrive, so it remains to the release dateless void for now.</p>
<p>"Layers of Fear is an effective scare 'em up but the sense of dislocation and the lack of character development left me feeling as if I'd enjoyed a thematically messy series of shocks rather than a cohesive horror story," Adam Smith (RPS in peace) wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layers-of-fear-review">his review</a> of the first game in the series. "It's a collection of scary things that are tangentially related to the idea of creative blocks and familial cruelty rather than an exploration of the artist or his personality flaws. By the time the credits rolled, I knew very little about this particular painter that I couldn't have learned by reading a brief synopsis."</p>
<p>Here's hoping Layers of Fear 3's spooks delve a bit deeper and deliver an undeniably through scarening.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Someone Just Completed Tarkov With the Worst Weapon Possible]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/someone-completed-tarkov-worst-weapon/</link>
            <guid>1437034</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Since November came around and Escape from Tarkov hit 1.0, hundreds of people have shared their accomplishments on social media regarding the game’s completion. With the introduction of 1.0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlestate-games/" id="1450">Battlestate Games</a> added a campaign to Escape from Tarkov, which means the game can literally roll credits and give players one of four endings.</p>



<p>Recently, one user shared an intense revelation. They’ve managed to get <strong>the best ending </strong>in Escape from Tarkov while using what might be the game’s <strong>worst weapon</strong>, as long as you don’t count the Blicky as a true contender.</p>







<h2 id="h-terminal-toz-style">Terminal, TOZ-Style</h2>



<p>Hours ago, a YouTuber by the name of ‘Freakatoid’ shared the news that they’d completed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/escape-from-tarkov/" id="232">Escape from Tarkov</a> with the ‘Humanity’ ending <strong>while using a TOZ bolt-action shotgun</strong>. That’s right, the memeable weapon that’s typically wielded exclusively by the most bargain-basement, bottom-of-the-barrel scavs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It took Freaktoid more than five weeks of consecutive attempts (51 in total) to punch through Terminal while using the TOZ-106. Midway through the attempt spree, Freakatoid shared screenshots of their progress, including an insane image of a <strong>PvE run </strong>on Woods with the TOZ-106 that included the taking down of at least two PMCs, Partizan, Shturman, and his guards.</p>



<p>Okay, so it was in PvE, but it was with a gun that’s widely considered the worst weapon in Escape from Tarkov, which makes it commendable.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the gun:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/" id="161469">completion of Escape from Tarkov</a> <strong>with </strong>the TOZ, a 20-gauge shotgun that at the most can be fitted with five-shot magazines and a range of 20/70 shells, was done on PvP. As you might know, Terminal is <strong>exclusively </strong>PvE right now, so it might render that concept moot, but nobody else is out here completing the game like this.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape From Tarkov: Toz Terminal Completion (Unedited)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q3ZgGQyl764?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>To get it done, Freakatoid used a dual-TOZ loadout, one loaded with a Vortex Razor scope and slugs for picking off enemies at range, while the other was stock with five-shot magazines and heavy buck shells for close-range encounters. He went in loaded for bear with a Ronin respirator mask and a 6B45 vest with tier-five plates, and a rig filled to the brim with heals and magazines.</p>



<p>In the comments under their post, Freakatoid was challenged to complete the game with a PM pistol, a small Marakov handgun that might work a little better as it can be fitted with an 84-round magazine.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s his next challenge; he certainly seems open to it.</p>







<p>Is this the most impressive Escape from Tarkov completion you’ve seen? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>So, we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-hour-with-pokopia-suggests-itll-might-be-the-best-pokemon-spin-off-ever-and-its-more-viva-pinata-than-minecraft-or-animal-crossing">looking impressive</a> so far, and we've also been told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">it's a pretty long game</a> even if you aren't planning on sticking around after the credits roll. With so much to do and a multiplayer option that's promising one of the most relaxing experiences of the year, how do its online functionalities work exactly?</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124">Famitsu's big interview</a> with key Pokémon, Game Freak, and Koei Tecmo figures (hat tip to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kano01.bsky.social/post/3mexpgsz4t22m">Kano on Bluesky</a>), we've found out about another bit of info that should please everyone who was already looking forward to the game, especially those who spent way too much time playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> with friends on private servers back in the day.</p>
<p>Before getting into how the multiplayer actually works in Pokopia, game director Takuto Edagawa revealed the project is Omega Force's largest to date: "I can't give you a specific number of people, but this is the largest number of people involved in any title developed by ω-Force (Omega Force)* to date." Moreover, creative work on the game wasn't one-sided with Game Freak and The Pokémon Company only approving submissions; new Pokémon designs were created and iterated on together all the way through.</p>
<p>About multiplayer, Edagawa says it indeed works as explained in the trailer released so far: You can either visit a host's main island or develop a "blank" one that's completely separate from the story mode progress. That second one allows players to "work together" in order to fully develop and reshape it into the peaceful village of their dreams.</p><p>The important bit here is that "even if the host (island owner) isn't playing, everyone can join in and play." The team is calling this system "Cloud Island" and it essentially works like you were thinking: Minecraft's private, persistent servers. This potentially means it's the sort of online feature that will one day go offline, but it opens up many possibilities and should make Pokémon Pokopia immensely more attractive for those of us whose schedules rarely line up. In fact, Edagawa basically states <em>that</em> was the driving force behind the functionality.</p>
<p>With only a little over two weeks to go, Pokopia is looking like one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>'s strongest exclusives yet, and I'm personally thinking it's going to be among 2026's biggest hits. Are you excited by the news on how multiplayer works or are you going full solo?</p>

            <p>If learning that the next entry into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> series was going multiplatform had you worried about the graphical quality of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s upcoming narrative rollercoaster, a recent interview with director Naoki Hamaguchi should put those fears to rest.</p>
<p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-will-not-compromise-on-graphics-whatsoever-despite-multiplatform-shift-director-naoki-hamaguchi-addresses-co/">Speaking to Automaton</a>, Hamaguchi reassured fans concerned about the graphical quality of FF7 Remake, when asked whether recent ports to the Xbox Series S or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> had any impact on development.</p>
<p>"Both the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox versions have been incredibly well received and generated a lot of buzz online," Hamaguchi said. "That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with. ...I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it (laughs). "</p>
<p>Later in the interview Hamaguchi explained that due to the gradual explosion of PC popularity in Japan, and the faster rate of PC adoption in the West, the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series is being built with PCs in mind, reducing the quality of assets for medium-end platforms like the PS5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, then lower still for other platforms.</p><p>"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi  explained. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p>
<p>"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third installment. As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first. "</p>
<p>As of March last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-series-has-now-sold-over-200m-copies-worldwide">the Final Fantasy series had sold over 200m copies worldwide</a>, while the Final Fantasy 7 Remake sold 8.7m copies at the time. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Its sequel, as well as Final Fantasy 16 did not meet expectations according to Square Enix</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A console release for Steam's cat-breeding roguelike Mewgenics is currently in the works.</p>
<p>That's coming from none other than Mewgenics' co-creator Edmund McMillen, who over the weekend responded to a question on social media about when players can expect a console release of the indie hit.</p>
<p>Alas, while McMillen and his fellow co-creator Tyler Glaiel are working on this console version "now", it isn't clear when it will be released. "Not sure when it will be done," <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">McMillen said</a>.</p>
<p>On the plus side, though, it sounds like everyone regardless of console preference could get a bite of the Mewgenics pie, as McMillen added "at this point it might be in Dev for all systems". Personally, I can picture losing more than a few hours to Mewgenics while curled up in bed with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p>In a subsequent post, McMillen again affirmed a console version is on the cards, and that <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?s=20">there is DLC coming</a>. It doesn't sound like this DLC will be free, though, with the <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023171863946613160?s=20">developer stating</a> "it's going to take a lot of work/people".</p>
<p>As for that DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-dlc-is-coming-but-dont-expect-it-any-time-soon">McMillen has said the Mewgenics team will start work on DLC "in a few months"</a>, only after seeing exactly what it is fans actually like about the game.</p>
<p>Oh, and also, McMillen was not expecting Mewgenics to become the hit that it has. As a reminder, the game sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, and last week developer Glaiel revealed Mewgenics had sold half a million units in just 36 hours. That's not too shabby at all.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#app_reviews_hash">Steam reviews</a> are sitting at a "Very Positive" average, with comments such as "McMillen you did it again I want to punch you". There is also a lot of love for Mewgenics' soundtrack, which has been described as both "amazing" and "bonkers".</p>

<p>The lovely Christian Donlan has already been hands-on with Mewgenics, and all in all was quite taken with it. "If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Eurogamer's Mewgenics Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In 2024, after years of seemingly turning a blind eye, <strong>Nintendo</strong> brought the DMCA takedown hammer hard on Switch emulators like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryujinx</a></strong>. Despite the significant blow, however, it was far from the end of the Nintendo Switch emulator scene. Ryujinx and Yuzu forks are still available, and brand new emulators like <strong>Eden</strong> and <strong>Citron</strong>, just to name two, have emerged over time. Nintendo's latest big release, <strong>Metroid Prime 4</strong>, was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-runs-well-on-pc-emulators-can-even-be-played-in-stereo-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immediately playable on those Switch emulators</a></strong>.</p>



<p>On Friday, though, the Switch emulator scene suffered another scare as Nintendo <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/comment/o51du26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent a new DMCA takedown notice</a></strong> targeting the GitHub pages of most remaining emulators, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Citron</li>



<li>Eden</li>



<li>Kenji-NX</li>



<li>MeloNX</li>



<li>Pine</li>



<li>Pomelo</li>



<li>Ryubing</li>



<li>Ryujinx</li>



<li>Skyline</li>



<li>Sudachi</li>



<li>Sumi</li>



<li>Suyu</li>



<li>Yuzu</li>
</ul>



<p>The Citron website <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be dead</a>, and the same goes for <a href="https://melonx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MeloNX</a>. However, many of the other Switch emulators are still normally available, including Eden, currently the most popular one. In Eden's Discord, one of the project managers sent the following message on Friday:</p>



<p><em>Nintendo issued a DMCA takedown request against our Releases repository, hosted at https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases. At the time we're unsure what exactly will happen to that repository (or when anything will happen), but the most likely scenario is that it's removed and you won't be able to access our stable releases on GitHub anymore. Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page. Not the source code, not our Actions workflow, nothing on our self-hosted Git instance, not even our development PR/Master/Nightly builds. The source code is always available at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden, and releases are also mirrored at https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden/releases. Our development will continue as always!</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, a new build (v0.2.0-rc1) <a href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.2.0-rc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was uploaded yesterday to the GitHub Releases page</a>, where downloads are still available. So, I reached out to the project managers to find out what was going on, and they told me <strong>they're fighting the takedown notice</strong> with a proper argument that Eden's repository <strong>does not infringe any laws or GitHub's hosting policies</strong>.</p>



<p>I then asked Eden founder Camille LaVey <span>whether the goal was to continue&nbsp;<strong>even if the DMCA takedown succeeded</strong></span> and removed their GitHub Releases page. Here's his reply:</p>



<p><em>Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we're never sure of what the future can bring, so we're always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.</em></p>



<p>We'll keep you posted on what happens to Switch emulators after the latest Nintendo crackdown. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>

<p id="block-da980997-0420-4527-946e-b66c49bf3d07">Strands is a daily word search that challenges you to find words with a common theme. There’s also a Spanagram that reveals the deeper theme behind the words.</p>

<li>Words that are three letters and under do not count.</li>

<p>FaZe Clan beat Team Secret in the grand final in Paris, defeating the <strong>fan-favorite side</strong>, to lift the hammer and secure the $1 million prize. It was no big <em>secret </em>that the crowd was firmly against FaZe Clan in Paris, especially given the presence of Team Secret’s French competitor, Mowwwgli, who has failed to win on home turf.</p>







<h2 id="h-faze-clan-has-won-this-year-s-six-invitational">FaZe Clan Has Won This Year’s Six Invitational</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan has lifted the hammer in Paris in front of a roaring crowd, for better or worse. Today’s excitement was kicked off by Ubisoft unveiling this year’s Rainbow Six roadmap, and it blew the roof off the stadium.</p>



<p>From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solid-snake-rainbow-six-siege-revealed/" id="176941">Solid Snake as an Operator</a> to Ranked 3.0, and from a new social hub to four stacked seasons this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-year-11-roadmap-revealed/" id="176923">Year 11 is <strong>heavy</strong></a><strong> </strong>for Rainbow Six Siege fans.</p>



<p>As with almost every other year, the schedule began with a glorious Six Invitational, which is regarded as one of the most valuable esports tournaments in the business. It’s a multi-million-dollar event backed by Ubisoft, and this year, it went to Paris. It was recently revealed that <strong>next year’s event </strong>will be heading to Brazil.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan, which claimed the prize last year in Boston, had a brilliant tournament through and through. From a top finish in the group stage with just one close loss to a storm through the upper bracket in the playoffs, FaZe Clan refused to relent.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the grand final, FaZe pushed out Fluxo W7M, Wildcard, and Team Falcons, all before meeting Team Secret in the ultimate showdown. Team Secret also had serious momentum, having gone on a wild lower-bracket sprint and eliminating some heavy players to make it into the final series.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan was relentless, hitting Team Secret with an insane 3-1 finish. The first series on Consulate wrapped with a 7-4, while Bank saw FaZe yield a 7-2 scoreline. Team Secret came back miraculously on the final map, Fortress, pushing the game into OT, earning the team a slight respite.</p>



<p>It wasn’t enough to clutch up the final map, though, leaving FaZe Clan to secure another map win in OT on Border.</p>



<p>Last year, Team Secret won at the Esports World Cup, while FaZe Clan dropped out hard in 10th place. It’s safe to say that FaZe redeemed itself in Paris by winning back-to-back Six Invitational tournaments.</p>

<p>Edmund McMillen is one of the creators of the new cat-breeding roguelike game called Mewgenics. So far, the game has been released only on PC, where it holds a “very positive” review score based on over 10,000 reviews.</p>



<p>Recently, McMillen responded to a Twitter question about when players can expect a console release. In response, he said it’s currently being worked on, but they don’t yet know when it will be completed. However, it may be in development for all systems.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-mewgenics-is-a-smash-success">Mewgenics Is A Smash Success</h2>



<p>Mewgenics, in its first week on the market, is currently sitting at 89 on Metacritic with an overall user score of 8.1. The game currently has over 115,000 concurrent players on Steam, breaking its previous record of over 102,000 set earlier this morning. Edmund McMillen has been pleasantly surprised by the success.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game features a voice cast of several long-time internet personalities. Among those are Ethan and Hila Klein from h3h3 and iDubbbz. McMillen recently responded to criticisms of the casting choices, explaining why he stands by them and how long the process took.

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908">Nintendo Switch 2 </a>Virtual Boy accessories support VR-enabled Nintendo Switch games.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Virtual Boy is coming to Nintendo Switch Online’s Nintendo Classics catalog on February 17. To play Virtual Boy games, Nintendo is releasing two headset accessories. One headset will be a full-size Virtual Boy mock-up. The other is a cardboard version.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-new-virtual-boy-accessory-works-with-existing-switch-titles">Nintendo’s New Virtual Boy Accessory Works With Existing Switch Titles</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/confirmed-switchs-virtual-boy-headset-can-play-vr-supported-switch-games-including-breath-of-the-wild-and-mario-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Video Games Chronicle,</a> these accessories will work not only with Virtual Boy games but also with existing Nintendo Switch games that support VR. Nintendo, as part of its Labo lineup, allowed players to build their own cardboard VR headset.</p>



<p>To experiment with VR, they added specific game modes for four titles: Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Super Mario Odyssey, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. It’s also noted that the Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild retains the VR option</p>



<p>Per VGC, the main Nintendo Virtual Boy accessory, designed for stationary use, includes the classic red Virtual Boy filter over the lenses, but players can remove it to play Switch VR games in full color. The cardboard accessory is actually a wearable headset.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/billionaires-found-the-next-dumb-thing-to-gamble-the-economy-on-and-its-the-moon-2000669225</link>
            <guid>1436863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I know we’re all at our limit with tech ventures that the financial powerhouses of the world rapidly rally around as more foundational and beneficial resources to civilization wane. I know we don’t have enough ear space to fill with all the promises of utopian computer advancements that in practice require comical amounts of human intervention. That after all of the crypto, NFTs, AI, video pivots and pets.com collapses, the last thing we need is more gambling on speculative futurist nonsense. But hear me out: what if we fucked with the moon?</p> <p>This week, Deutsche Bank said they are fixing their attention to the “moon economy.” Earth’s lonely little celestial satellite, greeting us each night, shifting the tides and summoning werewolves. Though the grand prize of the 1960s space race, it hasn’t really taken center stage in the human imagination for generations. While we love our big floating space rock, it doesn’t have the potential or allure of Mars, our nearest understudy. The richest among us have begun to feel otherwise.</p>

 <p>Deutsche Bank’s focus is on Intuitive Machines, a Houston-based company developing tech for lunar exploration. They’re primed for the windfall of any moon-bound interest, and Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu says the moon economy “may have just gone through a key inflection point.” Which is to say we’re gearing up for a nitwit-off.</p> <p>Through 2025, the White House stated a renewed interest in moon missions. As part of the Artemis program, the U.S.A. is looking to beat China to the moon for military infrastructure and spycraft securities. That space race has kicked off a second, simultaneous one amongst billionaires. Jeff Bezos announced that Blue Origin is aiming to develop lunar landers for the program. It plays into the tension between NASA and SpaceX, whose progress on their contract has been sluggish.</p>

 <p>Incapable of sitting still, Elon Musk, who previously wrote off the moon as “a distraction,” said he is shifting SpaceX’s focus toward building a “self-growing city” there. It’s a screeching pivot for SpaceX, a company whose sole mission is colonizing Mars. “We can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,” Musk posted.</p>

 <p>Obviously government contracts are a financial boon in and of themselves. Much of Musk’s fortune comes from federal arrangements. But what’s the long-term economic benefit of chilling on the moon? Never mind establishing the first space city? As far as space campaigns go, it’s much easier to launch off a low-gravity body than fighting to escape Earth’s orbit and barrier of space junk (though new complications will surely emerge). You probably wouldn’t be surprised to hear this moon situation links up with the current AI situation.</p> <p>You’ve probably noticed AI, for all of its promises, is incredibly expensive. Consumer technology is in disarray as firms get first dibs on microchips. Data center construction is the toothpick holding up the American economy. The use of electricity and water cooling is exhaustive to local infrastructure. To set up camp on the moon would solve… some of that. If you think that sounds risky and untested, you’re correct. Just like current AI ventures, a loose promise is enough to bet the house on.</p>

 <p>The original space race ended on a win, something our current futurists are desperate to secure. It came through sweatbox collaborations between technicians, physicists and experts across all disciplines. It was to prove the capitalist west was greater than the USSR and develop some new rockets along the way, but still required putting that glory before short-term gains. The theme of the last decade has been “why we can’t have nice things.” There are strong use cases for the blockchain, language learning models and moon bases alike. But instead of researching and refining how this tech can secure a better future for all, we’re subjected to useless tchotchkes at the cost of breathable air. Our survival into this century is increasingly beholden to refried futurists, addicted to singular persuasive visions that don’t behave well with reality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideki Sato, the designer of all major Sega consoles, passed away at the age of 77 on February 13.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?s=20">The Japanese outlet Beep21 </a>reported his passing on its social media channels. He is widely regarded as the “Father of Sega Hardware.” He served as director of Sega’s Research and Development department during the heyday of the console war between Sega and Nintendo.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>セガハードの父として知られる<br>佐藤秀樹氏が昨日ご逝去されました。</p><p>日本のゲーム史<br>そして世界中のセガファンを魅了された<br>本当に偉大な方でした。</p><p>あの時代のワクワクと挑戦心は、<br>未来永劫、永遠に多くのファンの<br>記憶に残っていくことと思います。<br>心よりご冥福をお祈りいたします。</p><p>Beep21</p></div>— Beep21 (@Beep2021) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-hideki-sato-s-reflections-on-sega-genesis-design">Hideki Sato’s Reflections on Sega Genesis Design</h2>



<p>Speaking about the launch of the Sega Genesis, known as the Mega Drive outside of America, Sato told <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu </a>in a Sega retrospective that there was a belief that customers would appreciate video games in the same way they had with music. As such, they chose to make it look like an audio device.</p>



<p>“Since the Mega Drive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player. So we painted the body black and put the “16BIT” lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console,” he said.</p>







<h2 id="h-sato-wanted-wireless-controllers-for-the-sega-dreamcast">Sato Wanted Wireless Controllers for the Sega Dreamcast</h2>



<p>The Sega Dreamcast was Sega’s final hardware release. When discussing the platform, he noted some of his wishes for the console. He noted that he wanted a more cube-shaped design, similar to the Nintendo GameCube, but he really wanted wireless controllers.</p>



<p>“Personally, I wanted a more cube-shaped design like the Nintendo Gamecube, but we ultimately ended up with what you see today. One thing I truly wanted was wireless controllers. Those long cords are annoying. Next time, it will be wireless for sure! (laughs)”</p>



<p>That was a generation ahead, as wireless gameplay would not become the pack-in standard until the PS3 and Xbox 360 generation. A true innovator.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming sends its condolences to the family and friends of Hideki Sato.</p>

<p>Stellar Blade could be coming to more platforms in the near future.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/stellar-blade/" id="1204">Stellar Blade</a> was originally a PlayStation exclusive in 2024. It was later ported to PC. Developer <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=316&amp;category=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> is now touting the game’s success in its recent Q3 earnings report. They are also looking ahead to the Future of the Stellar Blade IP.</p>



<p>In the latest quarter, the game continued to sell copies steadily. In particular, the PC port saw strong sales, and its very positive Steam rating was highlighted in the report.</p>







<h2>Stellar Blade Could See Releases on New Platforms</h2>



<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/shift-up/" id="1687">SHIFT UP Corporation</a> expects the game’s popularity and overall brand to continue to grow. Additionally, they plan to make the game accessible to even more players. </p>



<p>To do that, they plan to run promotional sales across both platforms and are even considering expanding to platforms beyond PlayStation and PC.</p>



<p>“To further enhance brand recognition and boost sales, we plan to carry out various promotional activities and are considering additional platform expansions to make Stellar Blade accessible to more players,” it’s noted.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-era-of-console-exclusives-continues-to-fade-away">The Era of Console Exclusives Continues to Fade Away</h2>



<p>Not only is PlayStation porting some of its popular exclusives to PC, but Microsoft continues to push the idea that “Everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>As such, major Microsoft releases, such as Halo, are now being ported to PlayStation. The strategy will continue, as the forthcoming Fable title will also be available on PlayStation. <span>Learn more about Xbox games on PlayS</span>tation&nbsp;at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-studios-head-admits-inconsistency-in-multiplatform-release-strategy/" id="171816">this link.</a></p>

<p><em>Cory is working on his own project and it remains unannounced. I'll share more when I can. We will hear about it before 2027. My expectation is around Summer.</em> <em>Unless a major delay happens, the game will be out in 2027.</em></p>



<p>Another renowned insider, <strong>Shinobi602</strong>, <strong>corroborated this </strong>on the ResetEra gaming board, where someone surmised that Cory Barlog's game might be targeting 2028 while a smaller team prepares for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-is-in-development-while-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshly announced <strong>God of War remake trilogy</strong></a>. However, the insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot49-hunters-gathering-on-tau-ceti.1433161/page-22#post-151277215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>:</p>



<p><em>Not that far (barring any delays, of course).</em> <em>Like I said, given the quarter they're targeting, I do expect that [it will be announced this year]. Probably May State of Play or the summer Keighleys (SGF). As of now, I don't know yet. If not by then, then they've either pushed the release out further or doing a shorter reveal to release.</em></p>



<p>In September 2021, Cory Barlog <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> he wouldn't direct <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, leaving that role to <strong>Eric Williams</strong>. He was still credited as Creative Director and Producer for that game, but he also began working on another game that, <strong>several years later, remains shrouded in secrecy</strong>. There have been rumors that it could take place in a sci-fi setting, but it's nothing solid.</p>



<p>The only solid rumor came in July 2025 from Bloomberg's <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that <strong>the project was going well</strong> and that while it is not technically a new intellectual property, <strong>it might feel like it</strong>. This appears to be a hint that Barlog and his team at Sony Santa Monica are <strong>possibly working on a PlayStation IP that is being revived</strong> after a long slumber. If the insiders are correct, we're only a few months away from the announcement, anyway. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>"What David and Alexandre bring to Dead by Daylight is a rare balance of character driven storytelling and relentless genre intensity," said Jason Blum, Blumhouse's founder and CEO.</p>
<p>"Drawing from survival horror and psychological terror, their work establishes a world where fear is not just experienced, but earned. It is a cinematic blueprint designed to attract a director who can elevate that vision through performance and scale."</p>
<p>Behaviour seem similarly happy with the writers, too.</p>
<p>"Alexandre and David are two modern masters of horror, and their script celebrates a dark distinction, Dead by Daylight is a game, its world is a nightmare," added Stephen Mulrooney, producer and Behaviour's chief product officer.</p>
<p>"We look forward to working with a director who appreciates the depth of their story, and cannot wait to see their visceral vision brought to life."</p>
<p>We found out that Blumhouse - the horror-focused movie production company behind the likes of Paranormal Activity, Sinister, Insidious, and Get Out - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blumhouse-is-turning-dead-by-daylight-into-a-movie">plans to adapt Dead by Daylight into a film back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The project is being developed in conjunction with Dead by Daylight studio Behaviour Interactive and Atomic Monster (the production company run by prominent horror director James Wan), with the latter calling the game's "incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains...perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation".</p><p>Dead by Daylight launched its asymmetrical multiplayer horror - which sees four survivors attempting to escape a powerful killer - back in 2016, and the game's been played by over 50 million people since then and features some of cinema's most iconic horror villains, including Halloween's Michael Myers, Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger, Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface, Saw's Amanda Young, and Scream's Ghost Face.</p>

            <p>Hideki Sato, the designer of most Sega home consoles, has allegedly died.</p>
<p>As announced by Sega history zine Beep21, Sato – known as the "father of Sega hardware" – reportedly died on Thursday, 13th February. He was in his late seventies (some sources put <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/allcityslopshop.com/post/3met6tgjqg22b">him at 77</a>, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Hideki_Sato">others 75</a>).</p>
<p>"Known as the Father of Sega Hardware, Mr. Hideki Sato passed away yesterday," Beep21 announced, as translated via machine. "He was truly a great figure who shaped Japanese gaming history and captivated Sega fans all around the world.</p>
<p>"The excitement and pioneering spirit of that era will remain forever in the hearts and memories of countless fans, for all eternity. Rest in peace."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="ja"><p>セガハードの父として知られる<br>佐藤秀樹氏が昨日ご逝去されました。</p><p>日本のゲーム史<br>そして世界中のセガファンを魅了された<br>本当に偉大な方でした。</p><p>あの時代のワクワクと挑戦心は、<br>未来永劫、永遠に多くのファンの<br>記憶に残っていくことと思います。<br>心よりご冥福をお祈りいたします。</p><p>Beep21</p></div>— Beep21 (@Beep2021) <a href="https://twitter.com/Beep2021/status/2022662105904877996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 14, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Sato joined Sega in 1971, led the research and development department in the early 1990s, and served briefly as president at Sega in the early 2000s. He and his team developed most of its hardware systems from the SG-1000 to the Dreamcast, including its arcade machines, until he left the company in 2008.</p><p>"[Our home consoles] sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes, thinking we might sell half a million!" Sato said, recounting his time at Sega with <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">Famitsu</a>, and archived at <a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/">shmplations</a>. "It was a scale completely incomparable with our arcade board sales. And that is how our entire company caught Console Fever, and threw ourselves into that side of game development.</p>
<p>"We had a feeling that before long, consumers would be appreciating video games with the same sense with which they enjoyed music; moreover, since the Megadrive was a machine that you put in front of your TV, our concept was to make it look like an audio player," he added. "So we painted the body black and put the '16BIT' lettering in a gold print. That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive. (laughs) But we really wanted to play up the fact that this was the very first 16-bit home console."</p> <div>
