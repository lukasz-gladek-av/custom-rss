It ended up being 10 long years before the series returned, as FromSoftware shifted its attention to <em>Dark Souls </em>and mastering a new formula for action RPGs.

With fully voiced characters and a pitch-perfect smokey jazz soundtrack, <em>Duck Detective</em> has enough charm to keep you engaged throughout. Visually it’s a delight too; the two-dimensional characters move through 3D environments with satisfying waddling animations and excellent artwork. </p><p>Unraveling mysteries involves Mad Lib-like puzzles based on what you can discern from the environment, and from chatting with NPCs around the bus depot’s office, interviewing everyone from the manager, customer service agents, and the very jaded and over-it penguin janitor. You can visually inspect each character for notable details to discern elements of their personality, as well as ask them specific questions about evidence you’ll come across as you start to crack the case. </p><figure id="" data-id="bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-recommend-id="image://bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Happy Broccoli Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-recommend-id="image://bead541a9e744abb943db26bebd2097a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Duck Detective shows a word puzzle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Duck Detective</em> can be a bit of a challenging experience. It’s definitely a game you can chill out to based on its vibes, but you’ll need to pay a bit more attention to it than you might expect. Each of the Mad Lib-style puzzles require you to talk to a number of NPCs before piecing together everything you learned. But this is no creative exercise. Though there are some alternate outcomes based on your decisions, cracking each part of the case requires guessing the right words in each puzzle’s sentence.</p><p>I’d be lying if I said I didn’t brute force my way through some of these puzzles by just cycling through the options for each sentence until I got it right. Inelegant, and definitely not in the spirit of the challenges, I know. But in my defense, <em>Duck Detective</em> was actually a reminder for me that I don’t do well with Mad Lib-style games. There is an optional “Story Mode” that highlights wrong answers for you, which I ended up using. Also, while the entire playspace of <em>Duck Detective</em> consists of a lobby, office, kitchen, parking lot, managerial office, and a server room, the loading screens in between each area wore on me. They weren’t necessarily long, but as I ran around getting clues from each character, I started to get a little tired of the few seconds of a loading screen each time. </p><p>It helps that there are some amusing lines during each cutscene, such as facts about how likely ducks are to pay their taxes, how many of them are in existence, and what their relationship is with skateboarding. </p><figure id="" data-id="ed4793f36f22c0daf9a65410896b64aa" data-recommend-id="image://ed4793f36f22c0daf9a65410896b64aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a loading screen with the text: &quot;Did you know?

Yes, I struggled to figure out what was going on. Perhaps that just means I’m a bad detective. Or a bad duck. Either way, the charm and polish of this game makes for a breezy indie title you can move through in under three hours.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For instance, there’s a vault in Riley’s inner world where she hides her deepest darkest secrets, and inside, among other things, is a video game character named Lance Slashblade who Riley had a crush on at a young age. And Riley, I’ll tell you now: that shit might feel cringe to you as a teenager, but when you reach your 20s and 30s and become dangerously online, you will flaunt your thirst for fictional characters like the rest of us.

And sometimes they’re not just on people; they’re on cartoon characters,” director Kelsey Mann told <em>Total Film</em>. “That’s speaking from experience! Or videogame characters. We thought, ‘Oh, that would be so great. Riley could have a crush on a video game character. We could animate that character like he’s from a videogame, and have that kind of look – that kind of pixelated look.’ We were like, ‘That could be really fun to do, and hopefully something that’s really relatable to a lot of people.’”<br></p><p>The <em>Final Fantasy </em>comparison is enough to get my mind racing over how this character could appear in <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em>. The Pixar levels were some of the best parts of <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>, so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that Sora might visit an <em>Inside Out </em>world in his next adventure. Lance would make a pretty sensible party member if Heartless started showing up in Riley’s mind. You can imagine scenes in which they start affecting Riley’s emotions and actions in the real world, and it’s up to Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Lance to help balance things out. It writes itself, y’all. Even if Sora doesn’t go to an <em>Inside Out </em>world, Lance could easily be a summon that helps our hero in battle.</p><p>At this point, it’s still unclear when <em>Kingdom Hearts IV </em>is coming out.

Last year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/creature-feature-the-surreal-pixel-art-and-animation-of-animal-well">we interviewed solo creator Billy Basso</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the game, building its very unique style and fresh take on a beloved genre, and the appealing power of pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Limitations encourage creativity&quot;">"Limitations encourage creativity"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I view pixel art as a style that is sort of native to the medium of video games," Blasso said in the interview. "Most screens are fundamentally made up of a grid of pixels, and you have to do a lot of extra work to hide that fact. Pixel art embraces it instead. A lot of people think the main point of modern pixel art is to create nostalgia for older games, and Animal Well certainly has some of that. But I think there are also a lot of other good timeless qualities about it. In the same way people appreciate tile mosaics, it is satisfying seeing a form be abstracted, and more open to interpretation. I think limitations encourage creativity."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He noted that he created the particularly disturbing (or entrancing!) animations with "creative coding," with techniques developed alongside the game's engine. They include "functionality for particle effects and procedurally drawing geometry," and represent a desire to push past what folks might expect from a game evoking a retro style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As far as pushing into uncharted territory, I've been trying to use techniques that wouldn't work well for pixel art in other engines. I have a fluid sim that is constantly running on a layer for water and smoke effects. I can draw sprites into it the same way I draw anything else. I'm using normal maps for the background art along with a ton of dynamic lighting stuff. Early on, the game truly did look like an NES game, but I've been layering on more and more rendering systems over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Read the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/creature-feature-the-surreal-pixel-art-and-animation-of-animal-well">full interview</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for more insight on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Well</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s creation, including the philosophy behind its world design and emphasis on secrets and mystery.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-live-expo-2024-when-and-where-to-watch.880041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Indie Live Expo is Japan’s premiere online digital showcase series that aims to connect fans with indie games worldwide. It’s also one of the most packed events you could ever watch, with this year’s boasting more than 150 indie games to sink your teeth into.</p> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Of course, Indie Live Expo is an event produced in Japan, so the timings don’t always match up with when you might be available. For example, I had to be up well into the early morning for last year’s event, but 2024 seems to have a slightly more approachable schedule. To make sure you don’t miss a single reveal, I’ve outlined where and when you can watch the event across every available platform.</p>
 <h2 id="h-when-and-where-to-watch-indie-live-expo-2024" data-injectable="false">When and where to watch Indie Live Expo 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="INDIE Live Expo 2024.5.25 (English)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMEflpy4t0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">Indie Live Expo 2024 will start at <strong>5 p.m JST/1 a.m. PT/9 a.m. BST on May 25</strong>. Mercifully, it’s a Saturday, so whether you’ve got to stay up well into the night or get an early start if you want to catch it, you’ve got Sunday to recover from all the indie reveals and announcements. </p>
 <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="161" data-injectable="false">While there will likely be a host of co-streams for the event with dozens of creators, there are three official livestreams you can watch. These are as follows. </p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false"> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMEflpy4t0g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>YouTube</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/indie_live_expo_jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Twitch</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://x.com/INDIELiveExpoEN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Twitter/X</strong></a></li> </ul> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">I’ve included the official YouTube video for the livestream in this article above. If you can’t wait to talk about indies with everyone else who will be watching, you can head to the channel and sit in the chat. The Twitch and Twitter/X livestreams likely won’t go live until the event itself has begun or is about to start. </p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Last year, I found that the YouTube livestream was the best way to watch the event because it seemed to be both the most stable and the most up-to-date. In some cases, Twitch is where a showcase is streamed to initially before being diverted to other platforms, but it seemed like YouTube was the priority in 2023, so it could be again in 2024. </p> <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="true">While Indie Live Expo isn’t giving much away when it comes to the games it has to show, it has revealed a few we can expect to see at some point during the showcase. These are <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzRzwSSRRjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Piggy One Super Spark</a></em>, a hyperkinetic platformer by Hanabushi and Hako Life, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2403290/Boyhoods_End/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boyhood’s End</em></a>, an adventure game following the boy with the lowest human score in the universe, and <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525810/Witch_and_Lilies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witch &amp; Lilies</a></em>, a 3D dungeon-crawler where you foster relationships between the characters. </p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The concepts of these games are far more niche than what you might be used to, and the showcase is almost certainly going to bring more of them to the table. However, each title isn’t wacky or different for the sake of it. They’re titles real people cared about enough to make into games so others could enjoy them, too.</p>

<p>As long-time fans of the franchise, we can count on a brand-new Call of Duty launching annually, usually around the end of the year before the holiday break. But sometimes, keeping track of so many new and upcoming releases is tough. So, what’s the newest Call of Duty?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-most-recent-call-of-duty">What is the Most Recent Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>If we’re talking about the most recent currently available Call of Duty, then it’s the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-was-the-best-selling-game-for-january-2024-suicide-squad-was-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>. It’s come a long way since launch. Despite the poor reception to the campaign, which is still as short as ever, the multiplayer aspect remains a ton of fun. I mean, seriously, you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-as-snoop-dogg-in-call-of-duty-warzone-and-mw3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play as Snoop Dogg</a>!</p>



<p>Of course, you can find an active community on most Call of Duty games, including some old titles, such as Call of Duty: World at War. But if you don’t want to queue or hunt down an active server, then, without a doubt, the best place to play Call of Duty is Warzone!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-next-upcoming-call-of-duty-game">What’s the Next Upcoming Call of Duty Game?</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following a mess of teasers and cryptic messages from the studio, we know that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is coming this year. We’ve received word that it’ll launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-to-release-october-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 25</a>. </p>



<p>There’s a chance the first-person shooter will launch on last-gen systems—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—but there’s no telling just yet. Many developers and publishers recently started foregoing these systems in favor of future tech.</p>



<p>Either way, we can’t wait to see more of the Black Ops 6 gameplay, including multiplayer and zombies modes!</p>

                <p>After nearly a year since the end of its open beta, a few things have changed in MultiVersus beyond the new characters. Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Rick and Morty and the original voice of both characters, has been removed from the game and all of his lines have been rerecorded.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/multiversus-has-scrubbed-the-justin-roiland-voice-lines-snagged-from-the-show-replacing-them-with-game-specific-recordings-by-their-new-voice-actors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Roiland's replacements on Rick and Morty, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ricky-morty-voice-actors-revealed-as-showrunner-discusses-massive-search/1100-6518404/" data-ref-id="1100-6518404">Ian Cardoni and Harry Belden</a>, have taken over their leading roles in MultiVersus as well. As noted in the report, Roiland's original recordings for the game were comprised of snippets of dialogue from the show. But the new build of the game features original voice work by both Cardoni and Beldon as Rick and Morty, respectively.</p><p>In early 2023, word broke that Roiland was charged with felony domestic battery and felony false imprisonment. Subsequently, Adult Swim and Hulu parted ways with Roiland on his shows, Rick and Morty and Solar Opposites. Roiland also left his gaming studio, Squanch Games, over the scandal.</p><p>By March 2023, the charges against Roiland were dropped over insufficient evidence, and he celebrated the news <a href="https://x.com/JustinRoiland/status/1638629789258100737" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by declaring his intention</a> to rebuild his reputation.

Since then, no charges have been filed, nor has Roiland made any additional comment on the situation.</p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of<em> Final Fantasy XIV Dawntrail</em> just around the corner, the social media team for <em>FFXIV </em>(lovingly known as Tweetingway within the community) has asked players to submit their <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-relm-arrowny-can-tell-us-about-pictomancer-in-ffxiv/">Pictomancer</a>-themed artwork. There are some truly glorious entries, but also a worrying amount of paint-eating.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, the days of Radion paint are long behind us and unlikely to make a re-appearance as part of the Pictomancer’s basic rotation.&nbsp;Still, surely Eorzean paint is not the best for your digestion. <br></p> <figure data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you all once again for sharing your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PaintYourPicto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PaintYourPicto</a> artwork, they're all amazing! 🤩</p><p>Also, please stop eating the paint.</p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1793310930283217289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Players have been submitting their artwork in their droves using the hashtag <a href="https://x.com/search?q=%23paintyourpicto&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">#PaintYourPicto</a>, and while their skill is inarguable, there is something of a worrying trend running through a lot of the artwork shared — eating the paint.&nbsp;<br></p> <figure data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Now, as a miniature painter, I can confirm that sometimes, just sometimes, paint gets consumed entirely by accident. Dipping your brush into your drink that you’ve stupidly put a little too close to your paint water, accidentally drinking said paint water by mistake, or even licking your brush to sharpen the point before rinsing it off entirely are all ways by which I have consumed paint.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="639" data-injectable="true">This was pointed out in the comments, with people reiterating the brush-licking point and others who went as far as to say that Nuln Oil is ‘too yummy’ (which I cannot get behind because Nuln Oil is precious and far too easily spilled).</p>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Others asked some highly appropriate questions such as “is the paint safe to eat if it’s made out of Aether?” and when Square Enix is planning to drop the “/eatpaint” emote.&nbsp;Also, I can’t finish this without noting my favorite submission using the #PaintYourPicto so far:</p> <figure data-current-count="584" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false">I think the majority of us can relate.</p>

<p data-characters="455" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wuthering Waves</em> has officially been released and while most similar games are mobile-centric, this sci-fi gacha actually has three different ways of being able to play on PC. Like most PC game clients, you have the ability to changing around some settings to adjust the visual quality of <em>Wuthering Waves</em> in exchange for increasing or decreasing its performance. These are the <em>Wuthering Waves</em> Best PC Settings you could use for either of the three clients.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-pc-settings-for-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best PC Settings for <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">Before changing your settings on <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you need to decide if you want to target Quality—making the game look as good as possible—or Performance—ensuring the game runs as smoothly as possible. Ultimately it will depend on the type of PC you are playing <em>Wuthering Waves</em> on. </p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">If your PC is somewhat modern and has been purchased or upgraded in the last few years, you’ll want to shoot for the best Quality. However, if you’re playing on an older PC or perhaps even with a poor internet connection, you will want to go with Performance. You can also mix and match to find a happy medium in between, simply tweaking each setting one by one and seeing how it performs for you. Here are the best Quality PC settings for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>:</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-quality-settings" data-injectable="false">Best Quality Settings</h3> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">Because we are going for quality with these settings, we’re going to have mostly everything on maximum, except for a few settings that don’t really enhance the visuals but actually hinder them. Here’s the best Quality settings for <em>Wuthering Waves</em>:</p> <ul data-found-items="15" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="865" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0"><strong>Graphics Quality: </strong>Advanced</li> <li data-index="1"><strong>Screen Mode:</strong> Full Screen</li> <li data-index="2"><strong>Resolution: </strong>Maximum Monitor Resolution (Usually 1920×1080)</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Brightness: </strong>Ignore this one</li> <li data-index="4"><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> 60fps</li> <li data-index="5"><strong>Shadow Quality:</strong> Ultra High</li> <li data-index="6"><strong>Special Effects Quality:</strong> High</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>FSR: </strong>On</li> <li data-index="8"><strong>LOD Bias: </strong>High</li> <li data-index="9"><strong>Capsule AO: </strong>On</li> <li data-index="10"><strong>Volumetric Fog: </strong>On</li> <li data-index="11"><strong>Volumetric Lighting: </strong>On</li> <li data-index="12"><strong>Motion Blur:</strong> Off</li> <li data-index="13"><strong>Anti-Aliasing: </strong>On</li> <li data-index="14"><strong>V-Sync:</strong> Off</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">However, if you’re having trouble maintaining a high framerate or getting graphical glitches and stutters while playing, you will probably want to switch to Performance-oriented settings.

<p>Call of Duty remains one of the most highly coveted and anticipated titles every year, with a new release coming out like clockwork. Now that we have official confirmation regarding Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, coming in October of this year, let’s take a look back at the whole story arc. Here are all of the games in the Call of Duty Black Ops series!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-black-ops-game-in-the-series">Every Black Ops Game in the Series</h2>



<p>There are, with the recent announcement of the sixth entry, a total of seven Call of Duty games in the Black Ops series but six mainline entries. You have:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops (2010)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops II (2012)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops III (2015)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (2024)</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>However, if we’re talking about the entire story arc leading up to this point, then we must consider <strong>Call of Duty: World at War (2008)</strong>, as it’s something of a prequel to the entire story arc. Of course, it does not feature the same naming scheme as the rest of the sub-series, and it’s often forgotten as part of the storyline.</p>







<h2 id="h-key-characters-from-the-black-ops-series">Key Characters From the Black Ops Series</h2>



<p>Back when Call of Duty campaigns were thrill rides worth taking, the stories introduced players to countless iconic characters. Some of the most memorable include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Frank Woods</strong></li>



<li><strong>Alex Mason</strong></li>



<li><strong>Viktor Reznov</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jason Hudson</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>We know for certain we’ll see Frank Woods in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. We might even see Alex Mason. But as for the many other characters we’ve met over the years, it’s unlikely we’ll see many.</p>



<p>But hey, here’s to new characters in the franchise!</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> XDefiant - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Insider Gaming reports that as of earlier today, May 23, XDefiant had around 300,000 concurrent players across all platforms, with it reaching over 500,000 players shortly after launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-cod-like-shooter-xdefiant-is-unplayable-for-many-on-launch-day/1100-6523613/" data-ref-id="1100-6523613">despite early server issues that made it unplayable for many</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has reached out to Ubisoft for official comment and confirmation of XDefiant's launch numbers.</p><p dir="ltr">XDefiant may look similar to Call of Duty (Mark Rubin, one of Call of Duty's longtime executive producers, is behind the project), but it does differentiate itself in a few key ways. For starters, the game features various factions and classes inspired by other Ubisoft franchises like Splinter Cell, The Division, and Far Cry. It also puts an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">emphasis on its lack of skill-based matchmaking</a>, something that has been a sore spot for many Call of Duty players in recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">Like most shooters in the modern age, XDefiant does support cross-play and cross-progression, as well as various cosmetics and a battle pass. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-wont-have-pay-to-win-mechanics-ubisoft-says/1100-6523583/" data-ref-id="1100-6523583">Ubisoft has stressed XDefiant will not feature any kind of pay-to-win mechanics</a>. XDefiant is available on current-gen consoles and PC, but is notably not on Steam, with those who want to with a mouse and keyboard instead needing to download and install the Ubisoft Connect launcher.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is a story-driven cooperative experience. Players take on the roles of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode, and Robot as they fight villains and unlock unique powers.</p>

The Guardians of the Globe, one of the most iconic hero teams in the world, are all dead. So the new generation of heroes will have to master their powers fast. Or else, people will die.</p>

<p>The narrative of <em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is told across seven re-playable episodes. These episodes contain unique gameplay challenges and twists alongside superhero antics. At its core, the game is a bag-building game with a free-form battle system. One that makes it so no one has to wait for their turn.</p>

<p><em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is designed by Dire Wolf, the same studio behind <em>Dune: Imperium</em>. Its publisher is Skybound Tabletop, the same company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-table-top-game-announced-from-cyanide-and-happiness-creators-trial-by-trolley"><em>Trial by Trolley</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wacky-card-game-sheep-in-disguise-now-on-kickstarter"><em>Sheep in Disguise</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Teaming up with our partners at Skybound has been an awesome adventure,” said Scott Martins, President of Dire Wolf. “We’re thrilled to have created a new way to experience the Invincible universe and introduce fans to a great new board game.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Invincible</em> was created by Robert Kirkman (<em>The Walking Dead</em>) and Cory Walker. Thanks to strong character writing and subversive elements, it stood out among its peers. It has spawned an animated series which just wrapped up its second season. In addition, characters from the series have shown up in <a href="https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite_X_Invincible" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and the most recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> can be pre-ordered right now. It is being sold at an MSRP of $55.00, not including shipping. The game will be available in local game stores July 11.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-projects-shut-down/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-one-year-embracer-laid-off-4-500-employees-and-shut-down-80-projects.879963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-projects-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>From the opening weeks of 2023, the gaming industry was hit with a bout of turbulence that’s still rippling through the global market today. Tens of thousands of industry workers found themselves out of a job, age-old studios were shut down, and countless projects were cancelled as developers, publishers, and other industry organisations floundered, panicked, and tried desperately to recoup losses and placate investors.</p>



<p>Embracer Group, which ultimately became the ‘boogeyman of the business’, sat at the top of the table where these cuts and slashes were concerned. In a recent financial update, it was revealed that in the last year, Embracer made more than 4,500 employees redundant and shut down 80 projects.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-impact-of-it-all">The Impact of It All</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent fiscal report</a> published by Embracer Group, it was almost inadvertently revealed that around 4,500 employees were cut from the company books over the last year. That’s a whopping 27% of the global workforce, and it’s indicative of the vast changes made by the company since 2023 kicked off. </p>



<p>The report also confirmed that 80 projects were closed down. From January to March 2023, 221 projects were underway, but by January to March 2024, just 141 were in play.</p>



<p>Despite the monumental downturn, Embracer reported a full-year net sales increase of a substantial amount – 12% overall, with the monetary equivalent climbing to $3.94 billion. From huge divestments to the closure of studios – some of which had been operating for decades – Embracer tried everything possible to cut costs and recoup finances after the collapse of a multi-billion-dollar deal with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>By all accounts from an internal perspective, the transformation of the Embracer Group is nothing but a good thing. That’s the gist of what CEO Lars Wingefors said in the fiscal report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In April, it was revealed that Embracer Group <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/">will be splitting into three separate companies</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Asmodee Group</li>



<li>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends</li>



<li>Middle-Earth Enterprises &amp; Friends</li>
</ul>



<p>The global hope now is that things have stabilised at Embracer and will continue to stay that way – the industry has suffered enough.</p>

In short, if the community liberates an Automaton planet it will unlock a new mech with dual autocannons.</p><p>Of course, Helldivers 2 has a Democracy-fueled in-universe set-up for all this. The Automatons have a ‘Petafactory’ that must be liberated so it can be repurposed to produce the dual-Autocannon EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT. What that means is Helldivers 2 players now have five days to liberate Varylia 5. Chop chop!</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MAJOR ORDER: Surveillance has uncovered an Automaton "Petafactory"; its only purpose to mass-produce heartless weapons of war.</p><p>Liberate it and we can convert it to produce en masse the dual-Autocannon EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT. <a href="https://t.co/r2yZeCvY2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r2yZeCvY2D</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1793674703359353305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Arrowhead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-community-unlocks-mechs-after-liberating-tien-kwan-but-theres-a-catch">tied the launch of Helldivers 2’s first mech to a collective effort</a>, so it’s no surprise to see it do so for the follow-up.

Hardcore players have expressed their frustration at how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/do-helldivers-2-players-just-prefer-to-fight-bugs-than-bots-it-certainly-looks-like-it">the majority of Helldivers 2’s huge player base prefers to fight the Terminids</a>, even when Major Orders revolve around the Automatons. One Automaton planet was recently lost despite it offering a bonus to the liberation rate, and this new Major Order is sure to spark a similar debate.</p><p>For now, though, players are heading over to Varylia 5 to get the job done. If a new mech doesn’t motivate the community, nothing will! But it's worth bearing in mind that the Helldivers 2 community is on something of a losing streak having failed the last few Major Orders, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-failed-the-last-major-order-and-now-the-second-galactic-war-has-begun">one to unlock a new stratagem</a> that is still unavailable.

And if you are buying from a third-party seller, you'll want to make sure the seller has plenty of positive customer reviews.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307250" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307250"></a><figcaption>Magic: The Gathering - Modern Horizons 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307251,1300-4307252,1300-4307253,1300-4307254" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>With that out of the way, one of the most enticing items up for preorder is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Horizons-Exclusive-Accessories/dp/B0CSVCRVRT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magic: The Gathering Modern Horizons 3 Bundle</a>.

<p data-characters="121" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Former professional <em>Call of Duty</em> legend Seth ‘Scump’ Abner shared the best controller settings for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">In <em>XDefiant</em>, controller settings are personal preferences, but choosing the right ones could be the difference between performing well or poorly in a match. With that in mind, here’s what the second winningest player in Call of Duty history has to say about which settings work best for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-best-xdefiant-controller-settings" data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> controller settings </h2> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="68" data-injectable="false"> Here are Scump’s <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/MotionlessAmusedStrawberryBuddhaBar-FkttZC9nd5lk7ymF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preferred controller settings</a> for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Reverse S-Curve </li> <li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity:</strong> 30 </li> <li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity: </strong>30 </li> <li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Multiplier (Low Zoom):</strong> 1.00x</li> <li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Multiplier (High Zoom):</strong> 1.00x </li> <li><strong>Dead Zone – Left Stick:</strong> 4</li> <li><strong>Dead Zone – Right Stick:</strong> 4</li> <li><strong>Acceleration Speed Multiplier:</strong> 1.00x </li> <li><strong>Invert Horizontal Axis: </strong>Off</li> <li><strong>Invert Vertical Axis:</strong> Off</li> <li><strong>Controller Vibration:</strong> Off</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="607" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">To start, the aim response curve offers standard, linear, or reverse s-curve aim as options. Standard is ideal for beginners as the thumb sticks gradually move based on your input, but does so in a smooth and controlled fashion. Meanwhile, linear removes guard rails and the movement on screen directly emulates your input meaning there is less margin for error. Lastly, dynamic curve operates as a hybrid of both. This means that you get a gradual build-up in rotation speed relative to thumb stick movement, but it will then accelerate towards raw input to provide the feeling of snapping on to an enemy. </p>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Next up, horizontal and vertical sensitivity dictates how fast the camera moves. Players can either use a high sensitivity to move around quicker and engage enemies quicker or use a low number that offers more control and consistency while aiming. Dead zones are areas around both thumb sticks that don’t respond to movements and could feel like a delay when a controller is worn out. When choosing a dead zone in a first-person shooter, players should attempt to get to get as close to zero as possible without suffering stick drift.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Finally, ADS sensitivity refers to how fast sensitive the controls are when aiming down sights. This works similarly to regular sensitivity but only applies when a weapon is aiming in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-windows-11-debloat-copilot-ultralite-good-version<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I fancy myself an “idea man.” A thinker. And when I was installing Windows 11 on my latest PC, I was struck by a bolt of inspiration. “Wow,” I said to myself, “it sure would be nice if they made a version of this operating system that does not have five hundred things I would like to remove by force every single fucking time I install it.” So I would like to offer this idea free of charge to whoever took over for Bill Gates after he left to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/06/29/bill-gates-spent-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-to-improve-teaching-new-report-says-it-was-a-bust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not improve education</a>, <a href="https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-45-the-not-so-benevolent-billionaire-bill-gates-and-western-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretend like he was giving away all of his money</a>, and do <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bill-gates-should-stop-telling-africans-what-kind-of-agriculture-africans-need1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morally dubious charity work in the global south</a>: why not make a version of Windows that doesn’t have any of this shit in it?&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I can see you nerds out there typing “Chris, you could simply install Linux,” and you would be correct. But let’s just table that for a second, this is between me and “M$” as we used to call Microsoft back in my day. How about you create a version of Windows that’s just for me, without any of those new features you’re introducing to confuse older people with poor computer literacy? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128640/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-app-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bing news results and ads</a> every time I try to look for an app? Don’t need it.&nbsp; An AI Copilot that isn’t particularly helpful and that I find morally repugnant? Pass! OneDrive installed by default? No thanks, I am an adult. And this new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24159258/microsoft-recall-ai-explorer-windows-11-surface-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware-enabled feature that takes a snapshot of everything I do and say at all times</a>? Oh wow, that’s really bad, man, why would you think I would want that on my computer? None for me!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Introducing Copilot+ PCs" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JmkWJNng2I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can't fool me with 3D renders of hardware being disassembled in space. This sucks!</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let me level with you. Every single time I install your OS on my computer, I have to pull all of this crap out of it anyway, either by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowly and painfully uninstalling</a> or disabling it in the registry, or with a script that hasn’t been updated in several years and will probably break some key functionality in my computer. But I haven’t given up on you guys yet! You had a pretty solid run there before you got into this AI stuff. There are still many reasons for me to use your OS, like .NET Framework, Powertoys, winget, five very specific apps that don’t have a Linux version, and my fourth favorite web browser, Edge (“It used to be pretty good!”)&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>There's probably guys out there with no friends who want a garishly drawn picture of a mountain range, but that's not me! Credit: Microsoft</figcaption></figure><p>Look, I pay a questionable-looking but otherwise reliable key reseller 17 to 26 dollars every five years to buy me a legal OEM copy of your operating system from India, so the least you could do is listen to me on this one. Apple has its problems, and macOS is not perfect, but at least they know how to make an operating system that doesn’t feel like Tim Cook is personally inventing new malware to send to me every single day.</p><figure><figcaption>Microsoft Rewards is built into the interface of Windows 11 and you can't convince me anyone has ever used this for anything except scamming Microsoft with bots. Credit: Microsoft</figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not like you don't have people who know better; you own GitHub, for god’s sake. Just go down and ask one of those open source nerds “hey, would you voluntarily use this operating system without changing it?” and if they say “no,” go back to the drawing board until they say “sure” or “please stop bothering me.” And then sell me that version!</p><p>At the end of the day, we both know there’s nothing keeping me on your platform aside from inertia, boredom and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NxcGlP">In the wake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">WGA union contract negotiation</a> last fall, which demanded greater transparency over what was getting watched on streaming services, the typically secretive Netflix opted to start sharing viewership numbers on a regular basis. “This has been on a continuum for several years,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-biannual-viewership-data-report-licensed-content-1235834922/">Variety</a> last December, suggesting the streamer’s first ever “What We Watched” engagement report was just its way of playing catch up and not at all about being held accountable by the industry. <em>Sure, Jan</em>, etc.</p>
<p id="YKKQ4j">The initial report revealed just how essential licensed TV and movies remained to a platform that was <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/netflix-spending-budget-originals-licensing-content-shows-streaming/">proudly spending oodles</a> on original content. The story to be found in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">second report</a> issued on Thursday, which breaks down viewership and streaming hours in both film and television categories from July through December 2023, is more about the surprises: things one might assume were blockbuster hits for the streamer were more like modest wins, while less obvious projects apparently scored big. Also, Gal Gadot is a Netflix star.</p>
<p id="gAeTpD">Did you see <em>Heart of Stone</em> when it dropped last August? Slick action movie starring Gadot as super spy [checks] Rachel Stone? Not a movie that comes up a lot in conversation. (For what it’s worth, we dug it well enough <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824292/heart-stone-gal-gadot-netflix-movie-locations-stunts">thanks to some fairly savvy stunts</a>.) But despite its lack of cultural footprint, the latest from the studio and star that brought you <em>Red Notice</em> was a pretty notable hit for Netflix; according to the engagement report, 109.6 million people viewed the movie in the first five months on the platform. That outranks movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989691/netflix-leo-adam-sandler-animated-movie-vs-vijay-tamil-musical"><em>Leo</em></a>, the down-the-middle kid’s flick starring Adam Sandler, David Fincher’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23860173/the-killer-review-david-fincher-netflix-thriller-michael-fassbender"><em>The Killer</em></a>, and even the holiday-timed platform release of <em>Super Mario</em>. Oh, and 27 million people also caught up with <em>Red Notice — </em>the <em>Heart of Stone</em> effect is real!!</p>
<p id="RIKdSE">There was an even bigger winner for Netflix as far as movie output is concerned: the apocalyptic chamber drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23992542/netflix-leave-the-world-behind-review"><em>Leave the World Behind</em></a>, starring Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, which garnered 121 million views without an action movie price tag. Both <em>Leave the World Behind</em> and <em>Heart of Stone</em> trounced what was supposed to be Netflix’s giant holiday blockbuster, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001958/rebel-moon-part-one-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-star-wars"><em>Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire</em></a>, which rounded out at 57.8 million. While Zack Snyder’s movie might see a bump in the next round of number-crunching thanks to the recent sequel, it’s not a <em>great</em> look to be dominated by 2017’s <em>The Boss Baby</em> in the charts.</p>
<p id="n9f3Pp">On the TV side, no one series was able to eclipse the hit movies based on pure viewership, but there do appear to be winners. Unlike Netflix’s previous live-action anime experiment, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, viewers actually showed up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852346/one-piece-live-action-netflix-adaptation"><em>One Piece</em></a>, which clocked 541.9 million hours of view time in its first season (against 71.6 million views). Compare that to <em>The Witcher</em> season 3, a marquee series that appears to have struggled with only 363.8 million hours (and 47.9 million views). Netflix’s TV chart also saw wins from non-fiction and international programming — with Korean series making up nine percent of the total viewership across the entire platform. </p>
<p id="L3ZjkM">There are tons of wild stats in the engagement report and plenty of conclusions to be made as the streaming industry enters its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135254/rebel-moon-2-scargiver-review">cost-cutting, bundle-chasing, corporate-strategy-shake-up era</a>. You can read the entire report on <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">Netflix’s corporate site</a>. </p>

  <p id="s7WsXi">Hunter Schafer is an actor from <em>Euphoria</em> and <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, and she’s also a model. <a href="https://www.vogue.de/artikel/hunter-schafer-coverstory-interview">A recent shoot for Vogue Magazine</a> depicts Schafer in a variety of gorgeous outfits, but one accessory in general has drawn the collective attention of gamers everywhere: the Nintendo Switch. One photo depicts Schafer lounging on the floor, resting between her couch and a coffee table held up by a cherub. She’s gazing off into the distance with a Switch in her hands.</p>
<p id="RZ0jzK">This raised immediate questions from concerned citizens. The Switch is in portable mode; she needs to be looking at it in order to enjoy some gaming. Is it possible that Schafer was thinking of the Wii U? What could lead to such an apparent oversight?</p>

<p id="aBzM6U">Some gamers were quick to come to Schafer’s defense, pointing out that they play the same way. Who among us hasn’t wound up on the couch, watching TV while playing the Switch, eventually tumbling to the ground while in the depths of a gamer fugue?</p>

<p id="n4iEFj">Other fans were just enthused to see Schafer participating in gaming at all. Some suggested that she could play Princess Zelda in an upcoming project.

<p id="B0Gylf">Personally, I find Schafer’s gaming posture to be entirely authentic. I’ve found myself in all sorts of awkward positions while playing the Switch, and I’ve certainly been in similar situations. Sometimes, you’re playing <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and listening to a video essay, only glancing up when the narration indicates there’s an important visual. </p>
<p id="nS2XWg">Alternatively, perhaps Schafer is employing the pro-gamer move of looking away from the Switch during a long loading screen. I certainly have employed a similar tactic so I don’t have to see my own face, unflatteringly reflected back in the Switch’s black screen. Whatever the case, I hope we see more gaming-themed props in Vogue shoots in the future. I feel like there’s a lot of possibility there, and the reaction to Schafer’s shoot shows that gamers are invested in a console’s role in the high fashion industry. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/mario-64-sm64-speedrun-record-button-challenge-wii-1851497252<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How many hours would you stand around in <em>Super Mario 64</em> waiting to do something that’s never been done before? Five? Ten? A whole day? A speedrunner who goes by Marbler recently clocked in over 80 hours with the Nintendo classic to be the first ever player to beat it without pressing the jump button even once. This incredible feat required meticulous planning and waiting several days for a platform to slowly rise.</p><p>Video game speedruns are known for their wild glitches and the harrowing dedication of the players behind them, but few rise to the level of complexity and diligence required to complete them as <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221">A Button Challenges</a></span>,” which see players aim to complete the game (or specific stages) with as few presses of the jump button as possible. Jumping is integral to the design of the game’s 3D levels and the hunt for its collectible stars, so naturally speedrunners have long wondered how few jumps they could get away with and still complete the game.</p><p>The history of the challenge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dates back decades and is full of incremental discoveries and improvements</a></span>. While there are specific strategies developed for various stars and particular sections of the game, much of the difficulty revolves around the precise use of Mario’s other inputs, including the B button mid-air dive, to maneuver through intricate levels. Marbler completed a two A button press run of <em>Mario 64</em> last fall and has worked with the rest of the community to eliminate those two presses and achieve a true zero-jump, 70-star run.</p><p>On the original Nintendo 64 version of the game, speedrunners have gotten down to a single full A button press, which includes half-presses that get rounded down. But on the Wii Virtual Console version, thanks to some idiosyncrasies of its tech, zero is possible, though it requires going after some harder stars like red coin one for Big Boo’s Haunt. Often, speedrunners use software to map out what’s theoretically possible in a game before trying to enact it themselves. That wasn’t an option for Marbler’s zero-button-press run in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. This makes his latest run even more remarkable; it was performed in real-time by a human before it was ever simulated by a machine.</p><p>“The significance of [this run] is pretty big in my opinion, at least for the ‘A Button Challenge’ (ABC),” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in a Discord interview. “There hasn’t even been a tool-assisted-speedrun (TAS) made of a zero A press run of the full game because the standards for TASes in the <em>Super Mario 64 </em>community is that it must be able to play back on console. Wii Virtual Console has a plethora of issues that make this pretty much impossible for all but the shortest of TASes.”</p><p>There are two pivotal moments in the zero-A-press run. The first comes in the Fire Sea, a section of the game where players collect red coins in a lava pit on their way to the second of three Bowser encounters. Normally, players must use moving platforms to jump onto a green pole to climb to the next section. Navigating the obstacle course without jumping takes an incredibly long time but is possible <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332">thanks to how the Wii does math</a></span>.</p><p>That’s because every time the console converts a double value to a float value it truncates the extra bits, “effectively rounding such calculations towards 0,” Marbler explained. “[This] means the platforms (which use a double to float calculation for a sine wave oscillation) will slowly tend towards the center of the level,” he said. “After 78 hours, they’re high enough to bypass the pole entirely.”</p><p>That section would take even longer–roughly eight whole days–if not for another trick Marbler uses called “vertical speed conversion.” Making Mario land in certain ways lets him conserve momentum which can then be used later to get launched upwards. “I set the console to run and forget about it for 6 hours, then I return to it and touch the lava, which gives Mario a crazy amount of vertical speed, and land from it immediately to conserve it,” he said. “From there, I move forward by only punching until Mario is right at the edge of the platform, and let it run for another 72 hours.” Once he returns, he’s able to clip through the wall to get where he needs to go.</p><p>The second make-or-break moment comes near the very end when facing Bowser for the final time in the sky. It’s less about patience and more about precise execution. Players have to ascend a long maze of platforms which is normally impossible to do without jumping. A trick called the Chuckya drop, however, makes it possible to bypass the hardest section of the level without a single A button press. Further painstaking refinements to the strategy made it possible for Marbler to do the entire thing in real time.</p><p>The Chuckya is a purple enemy with red gloves that picks Mario up and throws him in semi-random directions when he gets close. But it’s possible to manipulate the enemy into throwing Mario exactly where he needs to go, it’s just very hard and was only theoretical until Marbler pulled it off. The speedrunner could write a fifteen-page academic journal article on how the trick works. I’ll try to break it down as straightforwardly as possible.<br></p><p>As Marbler explained, most enemies in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has a certain amount of logic programmed into it to avoid walking off ledges. That logic goes out the window if the Chuckya is in the air. The enemy also bounces when it falls. By getting the Chuckya to walk down a slope, the game essentially treats it like it’s falling and bounces it just slightly so that the game also thinks it’s in the air. When in the right spot, the Chuckya can toss Mario exactly where he needs to go. Actually setting that scenario up is much more complicated, especially since it’s entirely out of view during the whole process.</p><p>Normally, the Chuckya will chase Mario until he moves behind it, at which point it stops, waits, and then turns back toward Mario. To manipulate this behavior, Marbler relies on <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s very short draw distance. Once the Chuckya is just beyond the limits of what the game will render, it goes into a state of “limited updating functionality.” It continues “going through the motions of the chase” but won’t actually move or be subject to gravity. This allows players to get the Chuckya to fall off the ledge, freeze it in place, turn him in the right direction, reactivate the chase, and get him to where he needs to go to make the speedrun’s most important maneuver possible.<br></p><p>The final piece of the Chuckya puzzle is the 1/32 chance of being thrown in the right direction. Not leaving anything to chance, Marbler can manipulate this part of the enemy’s behavior as well. The enemy has a failsafe built in where it will die if it reaches an out of bounds part of the map. Before that happens, it will turn for 15 frames to try and get back on track. Using this reflex to his advantage, Marbler can make sure the Chuckya doesn’t throw Mario until there’s a floor in front of it.</p><p>“This brings the chance of a successful throw up to 16/32, and in addition to this, the place it lands it just so happens that there are two extra angles that work to keep Mario alive, for a grand total of an 18/32 (56.25%) chance of success on the throw,” he told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Not ideal to have RNG at the end of such a difficult trick, but a hell of a lot better than a 3% chance.”</p><p>The final run clocked in at 86 hours and 48 and a half minutes. That’s over three days total but just nine hours of actual gameplay, a drop in the bucket compared to how much time Marbler said he spent practicing. “If I had to guess, I’d say practice by itself was probably somewhere in the 150-200 hour range, with research and strat development coming in somewhere around 50-100 hours.”</p><p>For everyone watching live, it was more than worth it. Viewers began spamming the chat with “I WAS HERE” after Marbler successfully pulled off the Chuckya Drop Throw. By then it was clear they were watching history unfold before their eyes. “Dude it’s done,” he said during the stream once the credits started rolling. His next goal? Start practicing for the full 120-star challenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A gorgeous color palette, lovingly crafted characters and environments that look like an arts-and-crafts project, and an almost tangible feel to the visible fold lines on the screen are wonderful to behold. That’s a good thing for a game that will have you staring at the screen for minutes at a time due to its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-trippy-game-where-you-solve-puzzles-with-perspective-1842063755&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-trippy-game-where-you-solve-puzzles-with-perspective-1842063755">complex puzzles</a></span>. And that’s the game—well-designed puzzles in a beautiful art style packaged into a roughly seven-hour experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. It’s as simple as that, and while there are some shallow elements to the game, it nails the most important part of enjoyable puzzle design.<br></p><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196805,195301" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The big selling point of <em>Paper Trail</em> is its unique approach to puzzles. The game takes place in a 2D world viewed from above that you navigate through from screen to screen a la a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475">classic <em>Zelda </em>title</a></span>. But here the path is always impeded by a broken bridge, missing platforms, or some other obstacle. To overcome these obstacles, you can fold the pieces of the screen in on itself. Imagine each screen is a collection of flat paper pieces and that your job is to make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684">origami</a></span> out of them. </p><figure id="" data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By folding the screen at its corners and edges, you’re able to reveal the underside of the map and connect it in ways that let you progress forward. That starts simple, with puzzles just requiring you to fix a single path, but<em> Paper Trail</em> slowly adds new twists to the formula. Later levels introduce mechanics such as boulders that hold paper down and platforms that can swivel. Each new addition forces you to think a little more about how everything in the game works together to solve a puzzle.<br></p><p>The narrative push behind the puzzles comes in the form of the plucky protagonist Paige, a girl leaving home to live a life of academia. Her studies revolve around physics concepts like folding space, the skill that lets her manipulate the world and solve the game’s puzzles. <em>Paper Trail</em> regularly tries to put the narrative in the forefront in the form of short storybook sections that require you to fold through scenes, but the story is pretty shallow and doesn’t add to the experience. If anything, those moments are just a distraction from the main event. </p><figure id="" data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That creates an imbalance that could be a problem for some players. If you come to<em> Paper Trail </em>expecting a fun puzzle game intercut with an interesting narrative, you’ll be disappointed. This is a puzzle gauntlet. Every single screen you pass through is just another challenge. Solve one and another awaits ad infinitum. It’s akin to the equally delightful but relentless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock"><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em></a></span>, which is itself a marathon of puzzles with no rest.<br></p><p>I personally don’t have a problem with that, and find the challenge of solving one puzzle after another to be what makes<em> Paper Trail </em>enjoyable. But even I have to take it in short bursts. If anything is going to pull you through this game, it’s not the narrative or the world, but rather your own desire to complete these challenges and experience the satisfaction they bring. Even the gorgeous art style might not be enough for some, but for those who do find joy in the endless folding screens of<em> Paper Trail</em>, it is the cherry on top. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fragbite Group, a Swedish-based corporation, <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-declares-subsidiary-fall-damage-studio-bankrupt/?lang=en">has filed for bankruptcy</a> for its development studio Fall Damage. The $3.63 million filing comes months after Fragbite acquired Fall Damage in October 2023 for $1.86 million.</p>



<p>The reasoning for the bankruptcy, Fragbite says, is due to not being able to find a publisher for Fall Damage’s 4v4 shooter Alara Prime. The game was set to be free-to-play and release in 2024.</p>



<p>“Since the fall of 2023, Fall Damage has had multiple dialogues with potential partners regarding the publishing of the game ALARA Prime,” Fragbite said. “This process has been extensive, involving many counterparts, and despite receiving very positive feedback on the game’s quality and potential, the subsidiary has not yet been able to fully complete it within the necessary timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This has led to an unsustainable financial situation.”</p>



<p>There has been no mention as if there will be any layoffs because of the declaration. However, Fragbite says that it and its other subsidiaries will continue business as usual. Development of Alara Prime will also continue and is “on schedule”.</p>



<p>Lastly, discussions about finding a publisher for the game remain ongoing.</p>



<p>Fall Damage was formed in 2017 by former DICE developers Markus Nyström, Dan Vaderlind, Mikael Kalms, and Anders Gyllenberg.</p>

<p data-characters="208" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Admiral Bobbery is on his last legs in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> </em>Chapter 5. His final wish is to taste that sweet, sweet (I assume) Chuckola Cola. This starts a quest that can be somewhat confusing.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">He’ll tell you that his own stash of the drink probably washed up with the rest of the ship. This should take you back to the crew’s camp and Flavio.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Talk to Flavio, and he’ll admit to having the Chuckola Cola but will refuse to give it up unless you bring him a tropical fruit. You probably wouldn’t be here if you already found this, so let’s proceed with the assumption that you haven’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="40" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false">What Flavio is looking for is a coconut.</p> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-coconut-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">Where to find a coconut in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The tricky part of finding a coconut in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is that the camera won’t cooperate. To get one, you’ll need to go back to the suspension bridge where you saw the crewmates (including Admiral Bobbery) getting attacked by ghosts.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t really show it, but on either side of the bridge, if you walk toward the camera, you’ll drop down onto a platform. You’ll find a couple of gaps over water that are too wide for Mario to cross on his own. You’ll need to partner up with Yoshi and use their flutter jump to cross safely. You’ll make it to a pipe which will spit you out in the background.</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">You’ll find yourself on another island on the backdrop. There’s a single palm tree there. Walk up and hit it with your hammer. It will drop the two coconuts. Grab them, then head back to Flavio.</p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Flavio will complain about your gauche choice of fruit (fun fact: coconuts are actually considered a fruit) but will hand over the Chuckola Cola. Take this back to Bobbery, to fulfill his final wish.</p> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Spoiler alert: Bobbery won’t actually die. This is a Mario game. He’ll simply fall asleep. Wake him up, and he’ll join your party.</p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="false">Here’s an interesting fact: While the drink you fetch is called Chuckola Cola and is a reference to the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>games, it’s actually not intended to be that. In the Japanese version, it’s referred to as “Vintage Red,” which would suggest it’s a wine. This wasn’t changed in the Switch port and still remains as Chuckola Cola.</p>
