Yes, it’s an excellent platformer in its own right, but it is tugging on the heartstrings of everyone who’s ever owned a PlayStation console. While you run, jump, climb, and skate through <em>Astro Bot</em>’s many planets, you find robotic versions of characters from throughout PlayStation’s history. This collectathon is at the core of every platforming challenge you navigate, and you likely have memories associated with at least a handful of them if you’ve ever played a PlayStation-exclusive game. But nothing quite beats finding your favorites scattered across the galaxy. Finding Sly Cooper trapped in a jail cell, presumably for his kleptomaniac crimes, playing as a robotic version of <em>God of War</em>’s Kratos, and seeing Joel from <em>The Last of Us </em>labeled as a “Dependable Smuggler” who “tells the occasional white lie” is the kind of referential bit that makes <em>Astro Bot </em>delightful. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-early-access-review-1851496575"><em>Hades 2</em></a></span> keeps its predecessor’s stylish reimagining of Greek mythology going with a boss fight against Scylla and the Sirens. Portrayed as a rock band who fight with their music,, the Scylla and the Sirens boss fight is a challenging battle and an impressive display of sound design. The music correlates with the attacks the Sirens use, and if you take one out, their instrument will disappear from the backing track. Each foe you take down strips the song of its violent texture until all that’s left is deafening silence. <em>Hades 2 </em>is still in Early Access, and if the rest of the game is on the level of the Scylla fight, Supergiant has another hit on its hands.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s</a></span> best moments are hidden and completely optional. That includes a conversation with Mythal, an elven god who has become an important figure in the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe ever since the series dove into elven history in 2014’s <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. Reaching Mythal in <em>The Veilguard </em>is buried under a collectathon, multiple sidequests, and a few group therapy sessions as your party unpacks some massive lore bombs. By the time you actually reach her, it’s made very clear that you’re unraveling the very fabric of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and you best tread lightly.</p><p>Mythal can either be a willing ally or a begrudging asset by the end of your conversation with her. You can gain her favor in multiple different ways depending on your character’s background and what they’ve accomplished in their journey thus far. I’ve yet to talk to two people who recruited her in the same way, and it’s one of the few examples in <em>The Veilguard </em>that’s evocative of <em>Origins</em>’ persuasion checks. <em>The Veilguard </em>is full of memorable choices, quests, and characters, but in its dash to a more streamlined, <em>Mass Effect</em>-style RPG, it lacks the complex dialogue trees of its roots. So when you get one as impactful as the conversation with Mythal, it stays with you. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-recommend-id="image://09a4dcf26c04481f992bb57b55c251d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="868" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones is shown holding a brush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hitting a Nazi in any context is a good moment worth spotlighting, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>lets you do it multiple times with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">myriad of items at your disposal</a></span>.

A few dozen hours before you reach the end of the game, you learn that the protagonist you’ve been playing is essentially a character the prince envisioned and made corporeal. He is a projection of the hero the prince wants to fight for a better world made real. Many hours later, you learn that More, the enigmatic guide who has helped you throughout your journey, is the physical manifestation of the king’s own hope, but turned to nihilism, escaping into a fictional paradise that sure does look like a modern-day Tokyo.</p><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is gradually working its way to this moment. The game uses its fantasy world as a mirror to ours to illustrate that escaping into a fictional world where things are better is a defeatist mindset. People use escapism to survive, but it means they will leave the world outside their window behind. The Tokyo reveal is the end stage of escapism. Someone who once had the power to steer the world in the right direction decided to instead bury himself in a world where the work was already done and he never had to fight for anything. <em>Metaphor</em>’s story of collective action can’t end until our hero has stared into the fictional utopia he’s been aspiring to create and still decided to go back to reality and fight for a better future. It is a poignant, haunting moment masquerading as a mundane, modern-day metropolis. More’s imagined world is possible, but only if we make the effort to reach it. And defying his easy answer is when <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>truly gets to the meat of what it’s trying to say.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-recommend-id="image://112a0c9d231e34ea4254e21280ba8891" data-format="jpg" data-width="1284" data-height="717" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Pokemon TCGP shows a Pikachu card, Wigglytuff card, and three Misty cards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</em> can be a deflating drag if you’re not paying money for it. I open my packs every day and oftentimes feel like I’m getting junk pulls compared to all my friends. Then, I got my first “God Pack.” These are booster packs that include nothing but rare cards. Admittedly, my first one was a bit disappointing because it had a threepeat of the same rare Misty card; but it also came with a full-art Pikachu card I had been looking for since launch. If I were weaker-willed this would have activated something in me and made me a sicko for cracking daily packs in hopes of finding another pack of this nature. But it had the opposite effect. It gave me the card I was looking for. So I comfortably closed the app and haven’t looked at it in weeks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wrong Organ</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-recommend-id="image://117ae6ed7537678268240ff2980bf2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Curly is shown looking at the screen with an emergency warning in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a game that is light on the whole gameplay thing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a></span> makes the most of its simplicity with some memorable moments. Giving painkillers to Curly, the captain of your crashed spaceship who was burnt beyond recognition when the freighter went down, is one such moment in Wrong Organ’s horror game. <em>Mouthwashing </em>has you painstakingly open his bandaged mouth as his one eye stares at you, then push the pills down his throat with all the awful sounds that come with it. The first time you do it, it’s incredibly unnerving, and with each subsequent time you do it, you start to become desensitized to it. It’s just a routine thing to do as you explore the ship and unwrap the mysteries of what happened here. But when those mysteries are exposed like the burns underneath Curly’s bandages, force-feeding him those pills takes on new meaning. There’s a lot of horrifying shit that happens in <em>Mouthwashing</em>, and the sounds Curly makes as you force him to swallow some pills aren’t even close to the worst of it. But they sure set the tone for how hard the rest of the game is to stomach.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you first boot up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573"><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em></a></span>, you might think you accidentally turned on the wrong game. The main menu screen simply says “<em>Dragon’s Dogma</em>” with the <em>II</em> conspicuously missing. But no, what appears to be an error or perhaps an attempt at branding the sequel as some kind of reboot of Capcom’s long-dormant RPG is actually an intentional tease of what’s to come. You can go through the entirety of <em>Dragon’s Dogma II </em>without seeing the sequel’s true title screen, as its true ending <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-true-ending-how-to-unlock-get-1851348566&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-true-ending-how-to-unlock-get-1851348566">takes a little bit of work</a></span> and climbing around a boss-level dragon to reach. But if you’re able to put yourself on the path to the true ending, you’ll find yourself in a secret, distorted place called the Unmoored World.

When one is as deliberate as <em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em>’s, it shows that everything that’s come before has just been child’s play compared to what is to come.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a273909bbedabb0bc68e10d6d491f124" data-recommend-id="image://a273909bbedabb0bc68e10d6d491f124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Healer looks at Watcher as she is hooked up to medical equipment and says &quot;Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Healer looks at Watcher as she is hooked up to medical equipment and says &quot;Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sunset Visitor / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a273909bbedabb0bc68e10d6d491f124" data-recommend-id="image://a273909bbedabb0bc68e10d6d491f124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Healer looks at Watcher as she is hooked up to medical equipment and says &quot;Sometimes, just to miss something is enough.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span> is all about sharing perspective and wisdom through virtual simulations of the past. As you reach the final chapters of Sunset Visitor’s adventure game, you’ve learned some harrowing truths about the science fiction world inhabited by clones. But those truths are weapons wielded by those in power. In most stories, if your player character known as the Watcher were to die, those truths would die with her. But in <em>1000xRESIST</em>, memories and information are not tied to one person, as everyone can live through each other’s past through VR communions. <em>1000xRESIST</em> puts Watcher through hell as she fights to free her sisters from the forces that have kept them subservient for their entire lives. She gives her life to be a revolutionary spark of inspiration for someone else to follow. Sometimes that’s all any of us get to be. We’re a catalyst for someone else’s growth that pushes them to fight. But even if someone is gone, their impact and ,in the case of <em>1000xRESIST</em>, their memories, persist, even as someone else takes the reins. “There is a you...That remains and remains.”</p></div><div><p>In the age of TikTok and Twitter, everyone is hoping to get a viral clip of them and their friends doing some wild shit. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/content-warning-impressions-1851407637"><em>Content Warning</em></a></span><em> </em>is that feeling turned into a video game form.

What makes these bombs so memorable isn’t just the massive amount of hellfire they bring upon your enemies, but how much of a spectacle <em>Helldivers 2 </em>makes of setting one off. You have to enter a code to get the ball rolling, pressing your d-pad in a specific sequence you’d never pull off by accident. It’s a small detail that adds to the weight of what you’re doing as you set this bomb up to annihilate enemy forces. After you’ve punched in the code, you’ve gotta run out of the blast zone, and every second between activation and explosion feels like a full minute. Then, the bomb goes off and you level an entire area. You’ll reflect on the implications later, but at the moment, it feels pretty fucking cool.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-recommend-id="image://2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-recommend-id="image://2f6c14b794d6edd2d4a5f862b2759806" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rocket fires at a robot while on Groot's shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span> are one of the main differentiating factors between it and <em>Overwatch</em>. These are character-specific perks that team members get when other heroes are on their team. Some examples include how Namor gets an ice turret when Luna Snow fights alongside him and Star-Lord can revive himself when Adam Warlock is on his team. But one of the best ones is when the gun-toting raccoon Rocket and his sentient tree best friend Groot are on one team. The dynamic duo team up with Rocket riding on Groot’s shoulder, which looks cool and nets them a passive damage reduction perk. Rocket can just pump Groot full of healing orbs and the tanky tree becomes a near-unstoppable force of damage and disruption. It’s such a fun team up because both characters’ cooperation feels so tangible.

Rocket and Groot’s team-up, however, feels like two players becoming a powerful unit, relying on each other to fulfill a new combat role. If either player doesn’t hold up their end of the bargain, Groot and Rocket can be bled dry in seconds. When a competent Groot and Rocket work together, though? They’re nearly unstoppable.</p></div><div><p>Much of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-cloud-aerith-sephiroth-1851374178&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-ending-cloud-aerith-sephiroth-1851374178">ending is drowned in deliberate obfuscation and theatrics</a></span>, so when it does actually present something raw and honest, it sticks out above the nonsense. As Cloud and company descend further into the Forgotten Capital, there is a point where each of them faces a trial drawing from a difficult moment in their past. They’re forced to reexperience the trauma that has pushed each of them to this point in their journey, including Aerith. The last of the Ancients is forced to relive the night she lost her mother. The entire sequence is devastating on several fronts. Watching Aerith’s mother, clearly nearing the end of her life, trying to soothe her daughter’s anxiety by talking about them going on an adventure is gutwrenching. You’ll then play as a young Aerith pleading with uncaring adults in Midgar as she tries to find help, only to see her break down again as she realizes she’s powerless to change things. <em>Final Fantasy </em>grounds so much of its fantasy in raw human emotion, and <em>Rebirth</em> loses all sense of that in a convoluted multiverse play. But it is nice to look back at one of the most memorable scenes in the game that took place only a few hours prior and remember that when <em>Final Fantasy </em>stays grounded in those feelings, it fucking hits. </p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, the poker-based roguelike that took everybody by surprise in 2024, is known for being habit-forming, and there’s nothing that forms habits in video games like numbers going up.

<p>AMD has officially unveiled its new Ryzen 9000 CPUs during its press event at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. </p>



<p>AMD started with the reveal of the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D processors. Starting with the Ryzen 9 9950X3D, the high-end CPU features 16 cores with 32 threads. It also features up to 144MB in total cache thanks to 3D V-cache boosted CCDs (Core Chiplet Dies). Breaking the cache down, it’s 64MB Zen 5 CCDs and 64GB from X3D. There’s also 16mb L2 cache for the 144MB total. For everything it includes, the CPU carries a TDP of 170W.</p>



<p>The 9900X3D CPU comes in with a little less power, but not by much. The processor comes with 12 cores and 24 threads with 140MB of total cache and a 5.5GHz max clock speed. It has a TDP of 140W. </p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Ryzen 9 9950X3D</th><th>Ryzen 9 9900X3D</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cores</td><td>16</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Threads</td><td>32</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Max Boost</td><td>5.7GHz</td><td>5.5GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Total Cache</td><td>144MB</td><td>140MB</td></tr><tr><td>TDP</td><td>170W</td><td>140W</td></tr><tr><td>Release Date</td><td>March 2025</td><td>March 2025</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>TBA</td><td>TBA</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as performance is concerned, AMD says the new cards are up to 8% faster — on average — than the Ryzen 9 7950X3D. Some games like Black Myth Wukong only saw a  1% performance increase. Games like Counter-Strike 2, however, saw a 58% jump.</p>



<p>When comparing to Intel’s latest Core Ultra 285K CPU, AMD says the Ryzen 9950X3D sees an average performance increase of 20% at 1080p on high settings. Games like Final Fantasy 14, FarCry 6, and Watch Dogs: Legion were over 40% faster per AMD. Black Myth Wukong saw performance around the same while Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora performed slightly better.</p>



<p>Both of the new CPUs are scheduled to launch in March. An exact release date along with final pricing will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Intel isn’t leaving the discrete graphics card market anytime soon. During the company’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwYUiSXDZ5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CES 2025 keynote</a> on Monday, Intel’s new co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus said that the company remains “committed” to the market moving forward.</p>



<p>“I get this question a lot,” Holthaus said. “We are very committed to the discrete graphics market, and we will continue to make strategic investments in this direction.”</p>



<p>Intel launched its latest Arc Battlemage graphics card, the B580, last month for $249. The entry-level card features 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, and a 192-bit memory bus. The next Battlemage card, the B570, is scheduled to launch on January 16. That card will cost $219 and feature 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM and 18 Xe2 cores. </p>



<p>In addition to the new Battlemage cards, Intel is working on the next-gen Celestial and Druid cards. Those, however, are still years away. Intel has made it clear their goal isn’t to contend with cards like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and 5090. Instead, they want to give budget conscious PC users more options.</p>



<p>What do you think of Intel continuing on with graphics cards? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/tech.9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

In a short trailer, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer Net Ease has announced that season 1 begins later this week on January 10th. </p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/zATLJ6Cqt0c?si=0AmAYqhdKelPw7p0">According to the trailer</a>, season 1 features the arrival of Dracula who plunges New York City into eternal night by <em>*checks notes*</em> teaming up with Dr. Doom to tamper with the moon’s orbit. (Hey, it’s a comic book game, weird nonsensical stuff is supposed to happen.)  Apparently Dracula has imprisoned Dr. Strange in a pocket dimension and has also unleashed a horde of vampires because messing with the moon just wasn’t enough. </p><p>To fight against this nefarious plot,<em> Rivals</em> will add four new characters to the game’s roster — The Invisible Woman, The Human Torch, Mr. Fantastic, and The Thing — the hero collective known as The Fantastic Four. Throughout the week leading up to season’s launch, players will be get a first look at the new heroes and their abilities starting January 7th. The addition also has a bit of synergy with the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072910/marvel-studios-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal"><em>The Fantastic Four</em> movie starring Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby</a> releases in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/27/24207887/fantastic-four-has-a-real-title">July of this year</a>. </p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> appears to be scratching the hero shooter itch reminiscent of the early days of the original <em>Overwatch</em>. Developer Net Ease announced that the game <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1869080172814848471">has surpassed 20 million players</a> shortly after the free-to-play game’s launch in early December. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> creator Markus "Notch" Persson says he's hoping to start work on a new game that would serve as a "spiritual successor" to the block-based sandbox game he first created in 2009.</p><p dir="ltr">"I basically announced Minecraft 2," Persson tweeted shortly after <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow ">posting a poll</a> asking for players' opinions on the direction of his current project, which he says is "a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon-crawler."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I basically announced minecraft 2.<br>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.<br>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know…</p>  — notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"But then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia, and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash," Persson wrote in a post sharing the poll.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Minecraft fans went wild, and when asked to elaborate, Persson confirmed he was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875225803220512852" rel="nofollow ">"100% serious" about a sequel</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that maybe people actually do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again," Persson wrote. "I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite clearly being passionate about the idea, Persson was just as eager to share his fears regarding the ways a Minecraft sequel could potentially go wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it," he said. "Saying that, spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. [These are] the things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway, and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even <em>more</em> cash for?"</p><p dir="ltr">Persson added that he'd want any profit made from a potential Minecraft sequel to be "spent for good [things]," adding that despite Minecraft's popularity and success, the game has also taught him a lot about failure. "Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed," he wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Before signing off, Perrson stated that he had no intention to "sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing [with Minecraft] and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft sh*ttification about."</p><p dir="ltr">"I respect them for doing that," Persson said of Microsoft, which purchased Minecraft in 2014. "It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me."</p><p dir="ltr">In the years since the acquisition, Microsoft has expanded the franchise with spin-offs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/">Minecraft Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-dungeons/">Minecraft Dungeons</a>. As for the possibility of a sequel, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in the wake of the 2014 buyout that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-minecraft-buyout-possibility-of-mi/1100-6423159/">focused first and foremost on improving the original game</a>, rather than looking toward a sequel. In 2015, Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson said there were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/">"no discussions [happening] about Minecraft 2 at the moment,"</a> but neither Microsoft nor Mojang have ever said that a sequel was entirely off the table.</p><p>Persson hasn't yet shared any glimpses of his current work with players, so there's no telling what a Minecraft 2 might look like, though one imagines it would share its predecessor's cube-covered art style. In addition to a potential playable sequel, Minecraft fans also have a block-based blockbuster to look forward to, with A Minecraft Movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-trailer-for-a-minecraft-movie-provides-a-deeper-look-at-the-block-based-blockbuster/1100-6527875/">set to hit theaters in April</a>.</p>

It wasn’t a huge hit compared to other <em>CoD </em>games, not least because the Vita itself wasn’t a big seller. But despite the Vita being a portable console from over a decade ago and<em> Black Ops: Declassified</em> being a oddball spin-off from 2012, there are still enough people playing the FPS in 2025 that you can reportedly boot up a Vita right now and find a match in seconds. </p><p>On January 4, PlayStation content creator Radec posted on Twitter that they were able to boot up a PS Vita and find matches “instantly” in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1875686080378499148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The tweet went viral</a></span>, likely because a lot of people were surprised to hear that <em>Declassified</em> was still popular and being played in 2025. And I bet some people were just shocked to hear about a PS Vita <em>Call of Duty</em> even existing. </p><p>Radec isn’t the only person reporting this. In the replies to the tweet you can find other players sharing stories of how they just recently booted up the game on their own PS Vita and also found matches quickly. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/David_Jagneaux/status/1856836194526695884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another player shared how they found matches quickly</a></span> in <em>Declassified </em>in November, saying it only took about 20 seconds to find a full lobby. </p><p>“Legit. Like last month I connected my Vita to my mobile hotspot and checked <em>Black Ops Declassified </em>multiplayer and there were almost full lobbies with all kinds of players,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RicksterLPs/status/1875813935200530823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said another user in response to Radec’s tweet</a></span>. “The best part about the whole experience was there were no hackers. Just people who wanna unwind and play.”</p><p>Declassified isn’t the only old <em>CoD</em> game still being played in 2025. You can still boot up most <em>Call of Duty </em>games released on PS3, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PS4 and find players instantly. Some people just don’t want to move on. Be warned though, as someone who has done this, the people still playing these older <em>Call of Duty</em> games are veterans who know the maps and weapons incredibly well and you’ll likely get stomped over and over. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Microsoft is continuing to expand Xbox Game Pass, with new LG Smart TVs coming later this year set to support the service via Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox App on their new LG TV, no Xbox required. A select few games, around 50, will also be streamable via the new LG TVs for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who own them. Microsoft announced the ability to stream owned games in November, with titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">NBA 2K25, Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and others supporting the feature. </p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those looking to stream Xbox Game Pass titles without an actual console or PC can do so via their phone, Amazon Fire TV, or on newer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-support-coming-to-2021-samsung-smart-tvs/1100-6509215/" data-ref-id="1100-6509215">Samsung Smart TVs</a>. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> it will reveal more details about how the service will work on LG Tvs "in the coming months." It's currently unclear if support for the service will eventually come to some older LG TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Game Pass heading to LG TVs comes as part of Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This is an Xbox" marketing campaign</a>, where the company has looked to expand the idea of what it means to play on Xbox by highlighting how players can play "Xbox" on their PC, phones, or even TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a message Microsoft has been using for a while now. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">the goal was to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but that didn't necessarily mean selling more consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to allowing players to stream Xbox Game Pass titles from a variety of devices, Microsoft has continued to offer many of its first-party titles on competing platforms. Xbox's most recent big console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring</a>.</p>

                <p>Despite the fact that the second game in the Citizen Sleeper series hasn't been released yet, the creator said that he's already working on the third entry.

Citizen Sleeper 2 has an ending of sorts. I’m working on developing a tabletop game, which will be Citizen Sleeper 3."</p><p>Martin adds that he wants to take what he's learned from developing the two Citizen Sleeper games and apply it to something new. "The thing that drew me to making indie video games was that people are so welcoming and excited about new ideas," he explained. "I’m always wanting to propose something new and see how people react, so this will be my next step."</p><p>The series draws inspirations from tabletop RPGs and has action-economy gameplay based on rolling dice, so it's no surprise that the third entry will go back to its roots as a tabletop game.</p><p>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector launches on January 31 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-ps5%E2%80%99s-dualsense-but-for-xbox.1075095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/06/hyperkin-competitor-dualsense-for-xbox-compatibility/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hyperkin has revealed a new Competitor wired gamepad for Xbox, and you’d be forgiven for thinking it looks rather familiar. In fact, it’s basically a PlayStation 5 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a> controller remade for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>Hyperkin absolutely plays up to this, with the announcement blurb saying, “If you prefer PS5’s DualSense controller but want to play something on Xbox or PC, then this is probably going to be the controller for you.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Competitor comes with the striking two-tone white and black design of the DualSense controller or in an all-black version, but absent the rectangular touchpad, has a bit more of an X-Men vibe as the white panels continue in to meet a white and black Xbox button. Everything else looks very DualSense as well, from the D-pad design (which we really hope nails the feel and muted sound of the PlayStation D-pad), to the analogue stick placement, and the shoulder buttons and triggers.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a pro controller, so there are back buttons, and on the whole, the controller does look a bit chunkier than the DualSense – perhaps just from the flattened bottom below the sticks, which Sony has more moulded.</p>

<p>At this time there’s no details on pricing or availability, but if you’re a PlayStation fan suffering in the land of Xbox, this could be for you. The symmetrical analogue sticks will do a huge amount of the heavy lifting on that front, though it’s a shame that this is a wired controller and not wireless.</p>
<p>Hyperkin has made a lot of headlines over the years for their recreations of historic Xbox controllers, updating them for modern machines. That started with a recreation of the ‘<a href="https://hyperkin.com/hyperkin-duke-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-20th-anniversary-limited-edition-black-officially-licensed-by-xbox.html">Duke</a>‘ controller from the original Xbox, continued on with a ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/23/hyperkin-is-remaking-the-xbox-360-controller/">Xenon</a>‘ recreation of the Xbox 360 gamepad, and most recently they revived the smaller ‘<a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyperkin-duchess-wired-controller-white-officially-licensed-by-xbox">Duchess</a>‘ controller that Microsoft made to cater to smaller hands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-coming-to-lg-smart-tvs.1075092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG and Xbox have announced that they're teaming up in order to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG smart TVs via an all-new Xbox app integration.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2025/01/lg-and-xbox-partner-to-expand-cloud-gaming-experience-on-lg-smart-tvs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement on its official website</a>, LG says you'll soon be able to access the Xbox app via its new Gaming Portal, although it also notes that said Gaming Portal's availability "can vary per TV model", so you'll probably have to pick up a newer smart TV to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>If you are lucky enough to own one of the LG TVs that supports the Gaming Portal, you can look forward to accessing "hundreds of games" via Xbox Cloud Gaming, though you'll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to take advantage of that feature as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=92ELIiOv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-cloud-gaming-lg-smart-tvs-app.jpg?itok=WgxzCLmH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>LG and Xbox are teaming up to bring the latter's Cloud Gaming service to LG smart TVs.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to access a select few games that aren't included with Game Pass but that you can stream via the cloud nonetheless, including the likes of&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p>

<p>The app will be powered by LG's webOS, and it sounds like it might be just one of several cloud gaming apps available via the Gaming Portal; LG says the service provides a "comprehensive overview with an app list that includes cloud gaming apps, webOS app games", and more.</p>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is, of course, already available on Xbox consoles and web browsers, as well as in several other places, including Samsung's own smart TV line.</p>

<p>It's the cornerstone of Xbox's "This Is an Xbox" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">campaign</a>, which seeks to paint any device capable of running Cloud Gaming via a browser or the desktop Xbox app as an Xbox device.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=qEn7xTy8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lg-smart-tvs-xbox-cloud-gaming-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=wV8p4zoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you say so, guys.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">recently announced</a> it would allow players to purchase games directly from its Android app after a court ruling found in Epic's favor against Google.</p>

<p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer also confirmed that an Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away" rel="nofollow">handheld device</a> is currently being prototyped, although it's likely years away.</p>

<p>It's also unlikely you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>on that device if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">producer's comments</a> are anything to go by, although hey, maybe you'll be able to stream it via the cloud by then.</p>

<p>The Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls update is more star-studded than an all-star Avengers movie line-up, and we’ve got everything you need to know about the free-to-play shooter’s first major content injection.</p>



<p>Season 0 is coming to an end, sparking the beginning of a new chapter. Marvel Rivals has got off to a start so sharp even Blade would cower—joking, he would never do this. Rivals is the new kid on the block looking to stay and make its presence known until it matures into a wise Doctor Strange-esque figure. The first few weeks firmly established the hero shooter’s impressive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count</a>, but Season 1 is the first real test.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls isn’t make or break, but it could shape the F2P title’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-release-date">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fantastic. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>January 10 is the start date for Marvel Rivals Season 1 Eternal Night Falls</strong>, neatly coinciding with the end of Season 0.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals X</a> social media channel posted a <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1876297704340385803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message</a> on January 6 saying, “Season 1: Eternal Night Falls begins on Jan 10, 2025.”</p>



<p>If you’re familiar with any live-service shooter—Call of Duty, Fortnite, and Overwatch are common contemporaries—you’ll recognize the Battle Pass formula stays the same. Each pass has a counter showing you how many days are left. The final day allows the title to execute a seamless transition to the new season.</p>



<p>Some downtime or maintenance might happen, but otherwise, in this circumstance, we expect Marvel Rivals Season 0 to end with its timer on January 10, and Season 1 to get underway.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-start-time">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-arrives-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Eternal Night Falls</a> commences at <strong>1 AM PST / 3 AM CT / 4 AM ET / 9 AM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the verification comes straight from the same X status cited above. Check out the start time specific to you, make sure everything is updated and ready to go, grab some chips, and be heroic.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-heroes-in-marvel-rivals-eternal-night-falls">New Heroes in Marvel Rivals Eternal Night Falls</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-dropping-a-fantastic-4-trailer-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fantastic Four</a> featuring <strong>Mr Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and The Thing</strong> are the confirmed names making a spectacular entrance in Season 1. Also, <strong>Dracula</strong> has been outed as another potential character to use in the shooter.</p>



<p>We know this for definite as the Season 1: Eternal Night Falls Official Trailer&nbsp;showed off the fab foursome. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-when-doctor-doom-is-coming-to-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Doom</a> teased for weeks now, you feel it’s all coming to a head in Eternal Night Falls. The reveal also strongly insinuates Dracula as a villain: “The Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. <strong>Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals!</strong>“</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it’s just the Fantastic Four, or if Doctor Doom and Dracula are out for blood too.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-leaks">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Leaks</h2>



<p>Popular leaks suggest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leaks-reveals-details-about-ultron-and-the-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultron</a> is another character set to join the fray, and a host of <strong>buffs &amp; nerfs</strong> to key heroes are coming.</p>



<h3 id="h-ultron">Ultron</h3>



<p>A bunch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-marvel-rivals-leaked-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals leaked character rumors</a> are in the wild, but Ultron could be sooner rather than later. Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info</a> thinks “Ultron releases Season 1 and he’s a Strategist.” Additionally, their <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869869444455117276?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1869869444455117276%7Ctwgr%5E1bb1dd9231dc5324b962d40043263ee880ea27c0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fmarvel-rivals%2Fmarvel-rivals-season-1-update-3022179%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> also has a full look at <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1869868212927524964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultron’s abilities and difficulty rating</a> of <strong>Two Stars</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-buffs-amp-leaks">Buffs &amp; Leaks</h3>



<p>The Marvel Rivals – Leaks &amp; Info X page has also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1875777797676736764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">outed a ton of buffs and nerfs</a> which could impact Rivals’s meta.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick look at the characters expected to be reworked in Season 1—for better or worse.</p>



<h4 id="h-buffs">Buffs</h4>



<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger</li>

          <p>Last month, we asked readers to donate to a couple of good causes in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/win-hardware-collectibles-and-more-in-the-2024-ars-technica-charity-drive/">our 2024 Charity Drive sweepstakes</a>. And boy, did you deliver. With the drive now complete and the donations all tallied, we can report that Ars Technica readers <strong>gave an incredible $39,047.66</strong>&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a> and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> in this year's drive. That doesn't set a new record, but it nearly matches last year's total and raises our lifetime Ars Charity Drive donation haul since 2007 to <strong>over</strong>&nbsp;<strong>$540,000</strong>. Well done, Arsians!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-8nm-soc-ampere-efficiency-goals/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 T239 could be an 8nm chip, and while this could make good performance and battery life a challenge, there's a good chance this process node won't significantly impact the system.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the leaked system's motherboard, focusing on the T239 SoC, as most of the other components found on it aren't particularly interesting. While it is currently difficult to pinpoint the exact size of the chip due to the angled picture, Digital Foundry's experts think that the Samsung 8nm process node was more likely used for the chip over other rumored process nodes for a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, the chip is somewhat of an offshoot of the T234 chip, which uses the Samsung 8nm process node. Additionally, NVIDIA Ampere architecture was designed for this process node, and porting it to a different process node like 4nm would be a waste of time, as it would have made more sense simply to go with the Lovelace architecture, which was built with 4nm in mind. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">A Samsung 5nm process node</a> could still be possible, but it would still require porting Ampere over to a different process node. Also, the Samsung 8nm process node is quite cheap, as it has never been extremely popular, and Samsung likely doesn't have that many customers for it right now, so its low cost would definitely fit Nintendo's approach.</p>
<p>Even if the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by a Samsung 8nm chip, the process node may end up not being as big an issue as many are speculating. While 8nm is not particularly power-efficient, and achieving good performance and battery life on it may be a challenge, all the current power measurements are likely way off the mark, as they are based on the T234 chip, which is much bigger than the T239 and requires a certain amount of power even with reduced clock speeds. Additionally, the T239 chip may have begun development as some sort of offshoot of the much bigger and more power-hungry T234 chip, but the two chips have been designed by different teams, have different CPUs, and the Nintendo Switch 2 chip has some additional features, such as a file decompression block required for fast loading and asset management, so it's not a cut-down version of the chip used in the automotive segment. Having likely been designed from scratch on the 8nm process node with certain power-efficiency goals in mind, which are suggested by the small battery cavity seen in the leaked motherboard, there's a very good chance that the chip's process node is not going to impact the system in any significant way.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 motherboard leak was only the first one to surface online in the first few days of 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-high-quality-pictures-joy-con/">Yesterday</a>, pictures showcasing the new Joy-Con controller emerged online, and some of the additions from the original controller suggest that the controller could be used as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumor-mill-joycons-as-pc-mice-no-mans-sky-on-the-way/">PC mouse</a>. Will this be the new gimmick of the system? Hopefully, it won't take much longer to get the answer to this question and every other that fans have been asking themselves for a few months.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor.1075050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-hyperkin-controller-revealed-ps5-style-for-xbox-named-the-competitor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over the years, there have been a variety of PS5-style Xbox controllers, none of them causing quite as much of a stir as the Hyperkin controller. During the<a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-nvidia-ces-2025-ceo-jensen-huang-keynote-live-here/"> CES 2025</a>, Hyperkin announced a brand-new Xbox controller, which is called "The Competitor" and seems very similar to that of the PlayStation 5 DualSense. Much like the DualSense, the thumbstick on the left has now been moved down to be parallel to the right thumbstick, and the D-pad is moved above to replicate the design of the DualSense. While it has an Xbox-style design in terms of pattern, the colors are that of the DualSense, in a classic white and black design.</p>
<p>Hyperkin is well known for making controllers and other accessories that have a retro vibe, with many of the controllers they created being similar to the original Xbox controllers. <a href="https://hyperkin.com/full-product-list.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Their website</a> is a safe haven for those who want a hit of nostalgia, as they have items that pertain to every type of popular console on the market. This ranges from the PlayStation One to the PS Vita and even a Nintendo DS, for example.</p>
<p>Compared to other controllers on the market, the brand-new Hyperkin controller is a wired controller that can be used on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. While PC gamers commonly use Xbox controllers over DualSense controllers, this new Hyperkin controller contains something that is incredibly beneficial to the longevity of a controller. That is the Hall Effect sticks. For those just hearing about these for the first time, Hall Effect Sticks use non-contact magnetic sensors to detect movement, which should prove to be beneficial in making sure that the thumbstick lasts longer than that of a typical Xbox controller.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't many details about this new Hyperkin Controller other than the name of it and a trailer that was released on the IGN YouTube channel. Here, you can see the aesthetic they went for with the controller and the sleekness of the design. By the looks of the trailer, it seems you can either get the controller in black and white, or just fully black, depending on your preference in aesthetic.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyperkin's Redesigned Competitor Xbox Controller Teaser (DualSense-Style Gamepad for Xbox)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The video is only short and doesn't provide any details about the Competitor, but it's very obvious that they have taken heavy inspiration from the DualSense, even in the styling of the D-Pad and the buttons.</p>
<p>Those who have seen the controller now wish it had the option to be wireless, but that is proprietary tech belonging to Microsoft, and thus, it's not possible for Hyperkin to do so without getting permission from the company. While some are delighted with this new option, there is also an outcry from those who dislike using symmetrical thumbsticks, with some even saying that it will cause issues in the hands later on down the line.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sign of how much this Hyperkin controller will cost, but we will keep you updated when the information arrives.</p>
<p>Will you be getting The Competitor controller by Hyperkin?</p>
