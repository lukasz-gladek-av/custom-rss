            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4e70039ba7b4f"><a title="GameCube Grip Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e70039ba7b4f/gamecube-grip-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo launched its dedicated GameCube NSO pad alongside the Switch 2 last year, undoubtedly providing the best experience for docked play. However, much like the N64 pad before it, the controller doesn't do much to help with handheld play, where the Joy-Con 2 button layouts simply can't capture the <em>feel</em> of the original hardware.</p>
<p>Enter abxylute's N9C, a Switch 2 grip that launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/abxylute-n9-n6-full-size-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2?ref=7yzisn">Kickstarter</a> today and was almost immediately fully funded, which looks as close as we'll ever get to a GameCube pad built for handheld play.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-nitro-deck-for-nintendo-switch-almost-great-but-with-one-major-flaw">CRKD's Nitro Deck range</a>, this is a grip that sits around the Switch 2 screen, substituting the usual Joy-Con placement for one half of the 'split' pad. It attaches via the console's bottom USB-C port to keep the button inputs super snappy, boasts swappable joystick gates for both 8-way and circular options, supports gyro controls <em>and</em> has four extra buttons on the back for you to remap as you please.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, it nails the look of the GameCube pad. Sure, anything in that shade of purple is bound to bring the nostalgia, and the d-pad and stick tops are a <em>little</em> off from the original design (if we're really being picky), but it's difficult to knock that face button placement when we start to think about the prospect of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a> on the go.</p>

<p>If those violet tones are enough of a throwback for you, and you can do away with the GC's asymmetrical button layout, abxylute is also launching its N6 grip for a slightly more conventional look. This one packs in hall-effect joysticks, front-facing speakers, remappable buttons, gyro support and more. It might not be quite as nostalgic as the N9C offering, but it certainly looks comfier for extended handheld play sessions than the standard Joy-Con setup.</p>
<p>This one comes in either black or purple colourways, so you can choose how much of a throwback you want.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, both grips are only up for Kickstarter support at the time of writing, though early backers will have access to "a Super Early Bird price before full retail availability". You can pledge $618 HKD (around £59 / $79) for one of the N6 grips with an expected April 2026 delivery, or $696 HKD (roughly £66 / $89) for a N9C unit with an estimated June delivery during this early period</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frontier Legends, an Open World Survival Western Game, Launches Early Access This Spring (and Releases Demo This Weekend)]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/frontier-legends-open-world-survival-western-game-launches-early-access-this-spring/</link>
            <guid>1439560</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Canadian developer <strong>Neojac Entertainment</strong> (known for the games <strong>Junk Survivor</strong> and <strong>Athos</strong>) announced that its next game, <strong>Frontier Legends</strong>, will debut this Spring on Early Access.</p>



<p>As you could probably guess from the title, <strong>it is a Western game</strong>, and also an open world title with survival and adventure elements. <strong>It casts players as a greenhorn settler</strong> fresh off the train, dropped into the rugged and unforgiving American West <strong>with nothing but ambition and a will to survive</strong>. Players can then become a hunter tracking game through dense wilderness, a trader running goods between settlements, a lawman keeping order on dusty streets, or even a bandit carving out a criminal empire, according to Neojac.</p>



<p>The game blends fast-paced survival mechanics with crafting, exploration, and base-building in an open world that features staples like dynamic weather, day-night cycles, and unscripted NPC encounters.<strong> One of the most ambitious features of Frontier Legends is its settlement-building system</strong>: players can grow their starting camp into a <strong>fully functioning frontier town</strong>, recruiting NPC settlers and assigning them roles in farming, crafting, gathering, and defense. The settlement's health reflects the player's leadership, so a well-managed town thrives, while a neglected one risks crumbling under the pressure of the frontier's dangers.</p>



<p><strong>Exploration is said to be central to the game's experience</strong>. Players will be able to venture beyond their settlements to discover ancient ruins, forgotten camps, legendary treasures, and hidden secrets scattered across the game world. There's also <strong>taming of wild horses</strong>, with each horse sporting unique attributes that make them valuable companions for travel, combat, and survival.</p>



<p>The game also supports <strong>cooperative and competitive multiplayer</strong>, though Neojac hasn't yet clarified how many players can play simultaneously. Anyway, <strong>players can team up to trade, build, and endure the frontier together</strong>, or take the darker path of raiding, betraying, and fighting rivals for dominance. Community events and seasonal challenges are planned to offer ongoing rewards and recognition.</p>

<p>If this overview has made you interested in Frontier Legends, you may be happy to hear that Neojac <strong>is going to release a demo for the imminent Steam Horse Fest</strong>, which begins tomorrow and lasts through February 23.  The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3032150/Frontier_Legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also includes the minimum and recommended system requirements, which you'll find below.</p>

            <p>
I’ve been shying away from The Killing Stone because it’s a deckbuilding card battler, and we do get a lot of emails about those. The game launches into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone">Steam early access</a> today, so it’s time to have a proper gander. Ho now! This is a deckbuilding card battler… set in a mansion somewhere in the Arctic during the 17th century… created by Question Games, developers of ‘unfinished game’ game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-magic-circle">The Magic Circle</a> and weird suburbia sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blackout-club">The Blackout Club</a>. Yes, the same Question who were founded by people who worked on Bioshock, Thief and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>.
</p>
<p>
 What’s more, The Killing Stone reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>, in that it appears to be divided between a hellish table-top game and hellish goings-on in the world around that table-top game. To be specific, you’re playing that table-top game against a series of demons, with the souls of the cursed Svangård family hanging in the balance. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Between rounds, you explore the mansion in first person and chat to  the Svangårds, together with various animal familiars. Broadly, you’re trying to figure out what happened to your old mate Mariken, who appears to be responsible for the whole mess. The writing, meanwhile, comes in two dialects - “period 17th century English”, and “a more modern prose”, with full text and voice-acting for each.
</p>
<p>
This is… a lot! I wonder if I’ve hitherto avoided reading about The Killing Stone because my third eye picked up on the sheer occult density of the thing, and steered my conscious mind away. Alas, it is too late for me. And probably you, if you've read this far.

<p>
The early access build includes three “primary story acts”, each focussing on one Svangård family member and an associated deck of cards, three demon lords to play against, and a bunch of optional ritual missions, encompassing 6-8 hours of playtime. 
</p><p>
“As development continues, we plan to add translations into more languages, more story, expand the voice acting, and develop an even more complex mystery for you to unravel,” Question write on Steam. “This element in particular is where your feedback will be crucial, but we want to hear about everything, so be sure to join us on Discord where you’ll find some of the team deep in their own Occult rituals (aka game development).” Bless.
</p>
<p>
“One of 1.0’s biggest features will be our planned endgame content, The Reckoning, which we will have more information about soon,” the post continues, signing off with a note that “The Killing Stone is the game we’ve always wanted to make”. They’re planning to reach 1.0 in around six months. 
</p>
<p>
What do you reckon, then? I’m quite sold on what I’ve read, but I was similarly sold on The Blackout Club, which proved a bit creaky and lumpish in practice. Here is how young master Nic Reuben (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-blackout-club-review">summarised that game in 2019</a>: “Just like a secret clubhouse, it’s likely to lose its allure if you spend all your time there - but it’s exciting as hell to to visit in a snatched moment.”

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Normal </span><i><span>Pragmata</span></i><span> fans are excited about Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure because </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414"><span>it reminds them a bit of </span><i><span>Mega Man</span></i></a><span> or because they find its concept, setting, or gameplay intriguing</span><span>.</span><span> But some of the game’s fans are far from normal. Reactions to the infantile appearance of<em> Pragmata</em>‘s android protagonist Diana on the r/Pragmata subreddit have prompted one of its moderators to publicly step down from their role, with them citing the overwhelming influx of “pedo shit” as the cause. Another <em>Pragmata</em> community has been shut down altogether by Reddit over inappropriate posts.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community on Reddit has splintered into three distinct subreddits: r/Pragmata, the main subreddit, r/PragmataSFW, a self-described “attempt at building up a sub that isn’t plastered with pedophile dogwhistles,” and r/Pragmata_, which was just banned on February 18 for breaking Reddit’s “Rule 4.” For context, Rule 4 </span><a href="https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules"><span>explicitly forbids</span></a><span> the “sharing of sexual, abusive, or suggestive content involving minors.”</span></p> <p><span>In one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PragmataSFW/comments/1qw54aq/i_was_a_mod_for_rpragmata_and_it_disgusts_me/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>February 4 post</span></a><span> on r/PragmataSFW, moderator JoeZocktGames stated that none of their “proposals to be more strict were taken seriously,” and derided the r/Pragmata subreddit for inviting “several mods with feeds full of lewd Loli shit.” The user also claimed that another moderator, who is still part of the moderation team on the subreddit, had a post manually removed by Reddit’s main staff because it featured obscene artwork of Diana. “You know it’s bad when mods post CP and Reddit needs to step in.”</span></p> <p><span>Prior to moderator JoeZocktGames stepping down, the moderation team behind the original subreddit attempted to address the “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pragmata/comments/1qtgjj8/regarding_recent_toxicity/"><span>recent toxicity</span></a><span>” by banning “users who post sexualised content involving Diana” and removing “any sexualised comments, jokes, or content” involving the character. This is what led to the creation of r/Pragmata_, which solely focused on posting “lewd” artwork of Diana. The contents of the subreddit were </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1r7x4ul/dawg_i_just_opened_reddit/"><span>immediately condemned</span></a><span> elsewhere on Reddit.</span></p> <p><span>This wave of r/Pragmata_ scrutiny may be what caused Reddit to take action, leading to the subreddit being banned earlier today. Since Rule 4 states only that “sexual, abusive, or suggestive” content featuring minors and “any predatory or inappropriate behavior involving a minor” is strictly prohibited, it suggests the subreddit’s focus on Diana is the main reason for its removal.</span></p> <p><span>This is, sadly, not the first time that the </span><i><span>Pragmata </span></i><span>community has drawn ire for its inappropriate focus on Diana, as the “Cute” and “Funny” tags, a well-known “pedophile dog whistle,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/1l4gobm/steam_users_are_tagging_pragmata_with_pedophile/"><span>were spotted</span></a><span> on its Steam store page back in June 2025.</span></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/18/transport-fever-3-preview-getting-the-goods-from-mardi-gras-to-woodstock/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Coming up on a decade since the debut of Transport Fever, Urban Games have figured a few things out about their transport simulation series. Years of post-launch support, added features and working with their community is leading to their most ambitious game yet, when Transport Fever 3 launches this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Transport Fever 3 - First Look: Infrastructure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eyDKt6C1kC0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sticking with their in-house game engine, they’re able to roll a bunch of features and ideals from where Transport Fever 2 has ended up into Transport Fever 3 on day one. That means that this will be a fully synchronous release across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, when TF2 rolled into the console station a few years after PC, and it also means that cross-platform modding, which was only added to TF2 in 2024, will also be there on day one.</p>


<p>If you’re in it for the economic simulation, then Transport Fever 3 promises even greater depths than before. There’s over a century of transportation history here, starting in 1900 with the city, buildings and cars you see all changing and evolving as you carry on through to 2030. That means there’s over 290 vehicles, ranging from buses and trucks, through ships, planes, trains and even new cargo trams and helicopters. Cargo trams are a particularly interesting one, having been used in Eastern Europe to bring cargo into city centres instead of noisy, smelly trucks –&nbsp;something you’ll need to keep tabs on now, as every citizen in the map is fully simulated with places to work, shop and live, and their happiness will depend on pollution, noise levels and traffic jams.</p>
<p>And you’ll have a fresh appreciation for cargo in this game, as there are now 35 cargo types and it is now no longer handled automatically. If TF2 was all about money, then in TF3 it’s just one of many things to manage.</p>


<p>All of this will add new depths to the transport simulation sandbox, but TF3 will lean further into the tycoon gameplay and story objectives to overcome through a campaign of eight maps. Each one picks a particular period in history and takes inspiration from real events, using these missions as a way to introduce new concepts and keep things varied –&nbsp;there could be competition against an AI, a countdown mission with a timer, and more.</p>
<p>We sampled two of the levels, first heading to Mardi Gras in 1906, but finding that the city has been partially flooded and ruined by a storm. This is purely a narrative conceit here –&nbsp;while this game now has a day/night cycle and weather effects, they are purely cosmetic so as not to add crazy variables to the simulation – but it means that Mayor LaFontaine, the helpful Andrew and Miss Baker are banding together to rescue this year’s festival. LaFontaine wants a new hotel, while Miss Baker pushes him and you to help represent the black community and less wealthy, and Andrew’s just happy to be helpful.</p>

<p>Setting up transport routes, repairing roads and bridges and shuffling the good around that each objective needs gradually gets you used to the user interface, though it’s initially a little unclear how to go about certain tasks. I accidentally clicked through and sold off a couple horse and carts when cancelling an unneeded line, instead of having them sent back to the depot, and when I wanted a ship to go between collecting fish and shrimp, returning to dock between each, it took me a moment to realise I couldn’t drag the stops into a different order and had to set things up a different way.</p>
<p>But with Mardi Gras rescued, I could turn my attention to another festival in need, some sixty years later, with a somewhat legally distinct rendition of Woodstock. Now it’s a local sheriff and an enthusiastic rock organiser who will have to put aside any of the very surface level differences to make this a success, oh and Andrew’s still there to help out, though he’s now a bit of an old-timer.</p>

<p>The objectives have grown in scale by this point, so you need a bunch more wood to construct the stage, and the growing encampment needs plenty of food (and veggie food too, please) which is over on the other end of the map. Do you just get a truck to drive it across, or use the port nearby to ship it to the nearest town for trucks to pick up? It all builds up to a festival that’s as successful as you can make it accommodate people.</p>
<p>I feel that these narrative missions and tycoon gameplay will really help make Transport Fever 3 more accessible. I often find myself at a bit of a loose end when simply presented with a sandbox, so while that absolutely remains, having both a way to ease players into the simulation, and to give objectives in an intelligent way that keeps you more engaged will be great.</p>

<figure data-uuid="44c983db61caa"><a title="Goodnight Universe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/44c983db61caa/goodnight-universe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Skybound Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>We really liked <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">Goodnight Universe</a>, Nice Dream's follow-up to GoodbyeWorld's award-winning <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/before_your_eyes">Before Your Eyes</a>. But for the Switch 2 version, there was one big thing absent that players on Steam had — camera support. Eye-tracking and facial recognition is a big part of the game, but with the feature missing at launch on the hybrid console, we just had to be patient.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for those of you who have been holding off or who have been dying to replay the game as-intended, camera support is finally here! So, as long as you have the Switch 2 version of the game and a compatible USB camera (or the official one), then you're game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8gqsvyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Accompanied by a cute little visual to show you the best way to set up the camera for optimal eye-tracking magic, today's update also includes a little visual fidelity boost for the newest console.</p>
<p>As for setting the camera up, publisher Skybound Games recommends you play using this method in a well-lite space, with the camera positioned around 18-24 inches in front of you, with your face fully visible. You'll be able to test this all in-game before you start.</p>
<figure data-uuid="36eb7a64f6bbc"><a title="Goodnight Universe camera set-up" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/36eb7a64f6bbc/goodnight-universe-camera-set-up.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Skybound Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, time for us to dust the ol' Switch 2 camera off then. If you happened to miss Goodnight Universe last year, then prepare yourself for a beautiful narrative adventure.</p>
<p>The game has you control a six-month-old named Isaac — that's the age where you don't really understand <em>anything</em> and you're trying to get to grips with limbs, movement, all sorts of weird things! Oh, Isaac is <em>also</em> developing psychic powers, and a tech corporation has found out about that. So that's just an extra thing on top of everything else. Fun!</p>
<p>We scored the original release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/goodnight-universe">a 7/10 back in November 2025</a>, but even without the camera implementation, we thought the game was solid: "Isaac’s supernatural adventures are as entertaining as they are heartwarming, and though it isn't terribly long, it makes full use of every moment."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Wccftech recently had the pleasure of taking part in the first North American hands-on for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3493540/Transport_Fever_3/">Transport Fever 3</a>, an opportunity that was previously exclusive to Gamescom and TGS attendees. During this preview event, we got a first look at their brand new campaign as well as hands-on with the updated Free Game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Climate-Zone-Dry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Urban Games started with a bit of a look at the history of the studio, discussing how Transport Fever 3 has been a title the team has been working on for almost six years, and is the first time that they’ve attempted self-publishing their signature franchise; <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/transport-fever-2-review/">Transport Fever 2</a> was published by Good Shepherd Entertainment for the PC release and Nacon for the PlayStation/Xbox console versions. By the numbers, Transport Fever 2 was the transport management simulation genre’s best-selling entry with two million copies sold.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this year’s numbered entry, Transport Fever 3 is aiming to expand the focus on both the Tycoon mode and the late-game, something that fans have both been asking for. By giving players more mid-game goals beyond just hitting capital targets, Urban Games is hoping to make the third title more than just a train ride to maximum profits. For those with a more casual focus in mind, the sandbox mode allows players to build their enterprise from the ground up without having to worry about financial limits.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Lane-Management-Tool-Junction-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>By the numbers, Transport Fever 3 is aiming to have more than three hundred vehicles, thirty-five industries, and over forty types of cargo. Rather than having ships be limited to the latter parts of a campaign, as in Transport Fever 3, this year’s entry wants to give players more of a reason to integrate ships into their logistics; one reason given was the introduction of both sub-arctic and offshore industries.</p>



<p>For the preview event, Urban Games permitted us to either play through two of the eight playable campaign missions (Mardi Gras in 1906 New Orleans and Woodstock’s Summer of Love festival in the mid-60’s) or dive right into the sandbox mode and develop freely. I opted for the latter, mixing different attributes together to get a 1980’s bubble era Japan with desert biomes and limited resources. Some of the other campaign missions teased were Norway’s oil rush in the 1970’s, Manila at the turn of the millennium, and a futuristic mission set in the early 2030’s that they’re keeping under wraps for now.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Road-Crossing-at-Dawn-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As someone who’s not routinely a simulation player of this nature (SimAnt and RollerCoaster Tycoon/OpenRCT2 are probably the ones I’ve dabbled with the most), diving into Transport Fever 3 required having the kiddie wings on for a little bit before I could head into the deep end. The whole menu-driven formula to Transport Fever 3 does take some getting used to at first, realizing that players need to go into one menu to build out roads, taking into consideration the number of lanes, noise levels, traffic mitigation, et cetera. Once a road is drafted up, it needs to get populated with points like bus stops or logistics routes to move goods along the road. Then a third menu to purchase a vehicle to put it on the route. Then, a fourth menu to select what goods to transport on the route. Then, the consideration of adding maintenance or supply depots along the route to keep the vehicles in top condition and the goods flowing.</p>



<p>For the average player, it’s a lot to take in all at once. For a good ten minutes, I had tanker ships doing a route between two oil derricks and a processing plant back on land, with nothing being accomplished other than paying the salaries of captains who spent eight hours a day sailing around in circles. It wasn’t until I had one of the developers point out that I needed to manually select what the ships were supposed to pick up and drop off, in this case, oil, before they would actually contribute something of value. It wasn’t like the earlier industries I was working on, where transporting vegetables from a farm in one direction or meat in another way was done automatically once a supply route was established.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Highway-Under-Construction-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Thankfully, Transport Fever 3 has a novel notification system of urgently colored messages notifying me if there’s something in my logistics network in need of attention. When it was all said and done, my army of thirty-some Japanese Kei trucks was putting in long hours, sending processed oil all across the countryside, and constantly sending out day laborers as needed to help tend these oil fields or processing plants. In the end, I felt like a proper zaibatsu tycoon managing all of these different industries, all from the comfort of my desk.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>To cap off the event, I sat down with Nico, Publishing Manager for Urban Games, with a brief Q&amp;A of questions sourced directly from the passionate Transport Fever community on Reddit. The interview is still being actively transcribed by yours truly, so look forward to seeing his remarks shortly!</p>



<p>Transport Fever 3 is intended for a simultaneous release across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC with a targeted release later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The WWE annual cycle is circling back around again, and the release of WWE 2K26 is on the horizon, with not much longer to wait until the bell rings.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26</a> is the latest entry in the long-running franchise from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/2k-sports/" id="1233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K Sports</a>, bringing CM Punk back to adorn the cover after a great year for the World Heavyweight Champion.</p>



<p>Keeping tabs on all the release dates as the year enters a busy period can be tricky, but Insider Gaming is here to help with all the release date and start time details for WWE 2K26.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-wwe-2k26-coming-out-release-date-explained">When is WWE 2K26 Coming Out? Release Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Best in the world. Image by 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K26 has an official release date of Friday, March 13, though the exact date varies based on time zones.</strong></p>



<p>The release of WWE 2K26 comes as part of the frenzy of Wrestlemania season, due to take place in Las Vegas in mid-April, and lands just a few weeks after Elimination Chamber.</p>



<p>This gives players the opportunity to jump into a new WWE 2K title at the busiest time of the year for wrestling fans, allowing you to tweak the script or follow along as real-life events happen.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-wwe-2k26-early-access">When is WWE 2K26 Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>Early access for WWE 2K26 begins on Friday, March 6, giving eligible players a full week extra to jump into the game.</strong></p>



<p>Landing the week after Elimination Chamber in Chicago, it’s the perfect time for gamers to jump in and start to build out their stories using the new features in Universe Mode. </p>



<p>However, it comes at a cost, as early access is limited to those who purchase a premium edition of the game.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-mygm-features-extended-season-and-new-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 MyGM Features Extended Season and New Match Types</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-wwe-2k26-start-times">What Are The WWE 2K26 Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K26 releases at 12 AM local time on the above dates, depending on the edition you have purchased. However, there are some ways to access the game early.</strong></p>



<p>As WWE 2K26 has a staggered release window, players in New Zealand will be the first to jump into the game, while those in the Pacific regions of the United States theoretically have to wait longer. Fortunately for anyone who is impatient, modern gaming allows you to tweak your region and benefit from early access.</p>



<p>There are some caveats, however, as Nintendo Switch 2 players will have to purchase WWE 2K26 in the region of early access, and Steam players have no alternative options.</p>



<p>The table below outlines the start times for WWE 2K26, covering both the general release and early access, and what time the doors open for anyone utilizing the New Zealand trick.</p>

            <p>
An advert released to promote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has been banned after the UK's Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints that it "trivialised sexual violence" following an investigation.
</p>
<p>
As detailed in a <a href="https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/activision-blizzard-uk-ltd-g25-1319083-activision-blizzard-uk-ltd.html">ruling shared on the regulator's website</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/call-of-duty-advert-banned-in-the-uk-for-trivialising-sexual-violence-">Game Developer</a>), the advert - which began airing on YouTube and Video on Demand channels last November - focused on an airport security check where two security officers were, according to dialogue, "Off playing the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 7." Standing in for the officers were two "replacers".
</p>
<p>
"A male member of the public was then shown to be passing through the metal detector," the ASA description continues. "A male security officer said, 'You've been randomly selected to be manhandled – face the wall!' and turned the man around. The female security officer was then shown to be licking her teeth while picking up a prescription container and shaking it, before showing it to the male officer who winked back at her.
</p>
<p>
"The male officer then told the man, 'I'm gonna need you to remove your clothes, everything but the shoes.' The woman then put on a pair of gloves and said, 'Time for the puppet show!' A post-credit scene showed the male officer putting a hand-held metal detector in the man's mouth and said, 'Bite down on this, she's going in dry.'" 
</p><p>
The ASA says it received a total of 11 complaints about the advert. Nine believed it "trivialised sexual violence" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible and offensive", while two believed the ad "encouraged or condoned drug use" and "challenged whether the ad was irresponsible".
</p>
<p>
During the ASA's investigation, Activision Blizzard UK told the regulator the advertisement had been reviewed by Clearcast (a non-governmental organisation which pre-approves British TV advertising) which gave it an "ex-kids" timing restriction, meaning it could not be broadcast during or around children's programming or content likely to appeal to under-16s.</p>
<p>Activision also argued the ad "depicted a deliberately implausible, parodic scenario that bore no resemblance to real airport security procedures" and that previous ASA rulings "recognised that ads containing obviously absurd or parodied scenarios reduced the likelihood of being interpreted literally or being viewed as behaviour to emulate."</p>
<p>Addressing complaints of "trivialised sexual violence", the publisher insisted the advert "did not sexualise the act of performing searches and contained no implication that the acts were sexual in nature." It similarly argued the ad did "not depict illegal drugs or misuse of prescription medication."
</p><p>
Despite Activision's assertions, however, the ASA noted that while the advert contained no explicit imagery and while "most viewers would understand the ad was intended to be humorous", the humour was "generated by the humiliation and implied threat of painful, non-consensual penetration of the man, an act associated with sexual violence." It also felt that the officers' "confident and joking demeanour presented this [act] in a humorous manner."</p>
<p>"Because the ad alluded to non-consensual penetration, and framed it as an entertaining scenario," the regulator concluded, "we considered that the ad trivialised sexual violence and was therefore irresponsible and offensive." However, it did not uphold complaints regarding drug use, determining the advert was "unlikely to be understood as encouraging or condoning drug use" and was therefore "not irresponsible on that basis."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the ASA ruled - as a result of the upheld complaints - that the Call of Duty advert "must not appear again in its current form". Activision Blizzard UK was also told to ensure its ads were "socially responsible and did not cause serious offence, for example by trivialising sexual violence". At present, the airport security spot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH1csdj8oMk">viewable as a video on the official Call of Duty channel</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, the upcoming entry in Konami's legendary horror series, looks to be a console launch exclusive on the PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>This stems from <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/townfall/us/en/">the game's official website</a>, on which only three platforms are listed: Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PS5. There's no mention at all of the Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, or older consoles.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-proper-look-at-silent-hill-townfall">recently got a story trailer</a> revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony's State of Play</a>, showcasing the Scottish town of St. Amelia. Developed by Glasgow-based Screen Burn, it follows the tale of SImon Ordell as he navigates the mysterious town with his CRTV, a small electronic device he seems glued to for better or worse.</p>
<p>The game also got a further explanation courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw">a Silent Hill Transmission</a> hosted by Konami on the 12th February. This gave a further look on how the game will work, its mechanics and story, by the developers at Screen Burn.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">The game was first announced back in 2022</a>, and is one of multiple big SIlent Hill projects that have seen the light of day recently. Obviously there was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">was a great release from Bloober Team</a>, but also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-review">which also stole the hearts of many horror fans</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Big Bad Wolf</strong> have debuted a new gameplay trailer for <strong>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</strong>, just ahead of when players will get a chance to try out the game themselves when a demo is released as part of <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> on <strong>February 23, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The trailer digs into one of the game's core mechanics, investigations, as the player character <strong>Noah</strong> investigates an underwater mining station that, at least at first glance, seems to be abandoned. The trailer showcases the dark corridors of the mining station and shows Noah exploring the hallways, scanning and analyzing clues, before cutting to a montage of some of the more terrifying aspects of the game.</p>



<p>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss is set to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>April 16, 2026,</strong> and it's one of at least two Lovecraftian, Cthulhu-based games set to arrive this year alongside <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a></strong>, which is due to arrive sometime in Summer 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>What we'll be able to play through in the Steam Next Fest demo is currently unclear, though a press release for today's new trailer says that players can check the demo out "<em>to discover the unique atmosphere and original mechanics of this narrative investigation game before its release on April 16</em>."</p>



<p>This is the latest game from Big Bad Wolf after its 2018 mystery title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-council-episode-1/">The Council</a></strong>, and its 2022 RPG, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/vampire-the-masquerade-swansong-vampires-make-for-excellent-investigators/">Vampire: The Masquerade - Swansong</a></strong>. This sci-fi Lovecraftian horror was also identified by Wccftech as one of our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-most-anticipated-adventure-games-of-2026-against-fire-air-water-mind/">Most Anticipated Adventure Games of 2026</a>, and it's exciting to see that we'll be able to get our hands on it to test if we were correct in spotting it as a game to pay attention to.</p>



<p>We'll have some coverage of other demos to pay attention to with Next Fest kicking off this coming Monday, February 23, but in the meantime, <a href="https://wccftech.com/luna-abyss-hands-on-preview-doom-returnal-a-good-time/">you can check out our preview for <strong>Luna Abyss</strong></a>, another game due to arrive in 2026 that'll be participating in Next Fest that put its demo out early.</p>

            <guid>1439410</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The long wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/replaced-release-date-cyberpunk-pixel-art-batman-arkham-2000620061"><em>Replaced</em> was almost over</a>, until now. The beautiful pixel art action platformer’s March launch has been pushed back by the developers following feedback on a recent Steam demo. “The response to our Steam demo has been the ultimate fuel for us,” Sad Cat Studios wrote on Wednesday.</p> <p>“As a small team working on our very first title, we’ve poured everything we have into this project,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889">studio’s announcement</a>. “While the game is technically finished, reaching this final stretch has shown us that we need just a few more weeks to ensure the experience is exactly what you deserve. We want the version of <em>Replaced</em> you play on day one to be polished, stable, and true to the vision we’ve shared with you. Instead of March 12, the Game Pass release will now arrive on April 14.</p>

  <p><em>Replaced</em> began development back in 2018, was revealed at E3 2021, and promised for a 2022 launch. Lofty ambitions and things like the Russia-Ukrainian War torpedoed those plans. After waiting an extra four years, what’s one more month?</p> <p>The action-adventure’s Steam demo has gotten generally positive feedback. The 2.5D art, cinematics, and mood have all been praised. The combat, however, might leave something to be desired. According to some demo reactions at least,<em> Replaced</em>‘s mechanics might be a bit repetitive and undercooked compared to its visual aesthetic. If accurate, it wouldn’t be a huge surprise for a game like this.</p>

 <p>But sometimes style and vibes are enough. I hope that’s the case with <em>Replaced</em>.</p>

<p>There’s an argument to be made that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/lenovo-legion-go/" id="1113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lenovo Legion Go S</a> is a better Steam device than the Steam Deck itself. It supposedly runs titles faster than Valve’s own device, and it’s just as comfortable in the hand—an often overlooked aspect of handheld gaming.</p>



<p>There are plenty of variations to the Lenovo Legion, too. The Legion Go S is arguably the most affordable entry-level system, but if you’ve got the cash to spare, the newly-released Legion Go Gen 2 packs an even beefier punch.</p>

<p>Despite the name, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/asus-rog-xbox-ally/" id="165877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</a> isn’t a portable Xbox. Instead, it’s a more powerful ROG Ally X, with the standout being the upgraded processor.</p>

Any title with the Xbox Play Anywhere tag can be accessed on the device, and it’s ultimately a great competitor to the Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Now, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" id="908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> likely needs no introduction. It serves as both a home console and handheld device, but it’s a very different system that’s built for an entirely separate purpose from the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>The Switch 2 is not a portable PC in any shape or form, nor does it try to be. It won’t run games as well as the Steam Deck, and of course, you’ll be limited to the library available to Nintendo instead of Steam. However, what it does offer is easy functionality, accessibility, and a wide range of console exclusives that are some of the best in their genres.</p>

<p>Back to portable PCs, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/msi-claw-8/" id="3610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MSI Claw 8 AI+</a> is another solid entry into the realm of handheld gaming. It’s a capable device that more than delivers the promise of PC gaming on the go, though it does have a few minor drawbacks.</p>

<p>The main one is certainly the large screen size. You’d think that a larger screen would equal a better experience, but it can hamper the comfort when using it for extended periods of time. However, it does offer experimental AI that can adjust your game’s settings for optimal performance, which can be handy for new users.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/playstation-portal/" id="165643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Portal</a> is an incredibly unique device, as it doesn’t operate like most handhelds. Instead of running games natively on the system, it relies on streaming games from the Cloud all through an internet connection.</p>







<p>Therefore, it’s not a great device if you’re planning to game on the go, but if you’re settled somewhere with a strong connection? It could be one of the best in the business, especially for PS5 owners. It’s as great and comfortable to hold as a DualSense controller, and considerably cheaper than other alternatives. If you’re a fan of the PlayStation library, the Portal should be on your radar—with an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-oled-scheduled-for-2026-its-claimed/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-portal-oled-scheduled-for-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OLED version rumoured for 2026</a>.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Huge potential in a tiny package. Image by Game Console.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Admittedly, this entry is a bit of a gimmicky one, but when you’re talking about handheld gaming, it’s hard to ignore the glory days of the Game Boy and PSP. Through the power of emulation, an admittedly grey area in the realm of video games, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/r38s/" id="3609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">R38S</a> brings the golden age back to the small screen.</p>



<p>With over 15,000 games packed into the device from the get-go, you’ll be spoilt for choice the moment you unbox it. From the NES to the PS1, N64 to the Nintendo DS, it’s an emulation powerhouse. Of course, you won’t be playing the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/battlefield-6/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> on this thing, but if you’re a big retro fan, it’s definitely a system worth picking up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I played <em>Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock</em> constantly as a kid. I was hopeless using the guitar controller, and even had to use a standard controller. But what I remember most was how it introduced me to so many different songs. It was my first introduction to rock artists like Rage Against the Machine, and an obvious love letter to the whole art form. I got similar vibes from my hour and a half hands-on demo and preview event with <em>People of Note</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>A turn-based RPG all about music, Cadence and her band use the power of music while traversing the aptly-named land of Note. After my time with the game, I'm intrigued by the high notes, but worried by a few miscues.</p><h2>Systems That Sing</h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/measures-pon-1.jpg?itok=gtRNko7w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/measures-pon-1.jpg?itok=hsCvSO3M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture>It should be noted first and foremost, as it was at our preview event, that <em>People of Note </em>is a music RPG, not a rhythm RPG. Other games, like the recent <em>UNBEATABLE</em>, have music as a part of the plot and heavily as part of the gameplay. <em>People of Note </em>is all about music, but in the gameplay itself, rhythm is about as present as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a><em> </em>attacks.</p><p>For a game all about creativity, I found the more technical parts of the game to be where it shone brightest. In the game's combat, I was really impressed by the game's turn order system. In a mechanic that <em>Final Fantasy X </em>seemed to solve, I felt there were some really creative things happening in <em>People of Note</em>.</p><p>Turns are measured in stanzas, and each turn is a measure. The number of turns you get is determined by a "time signature," where the top number is the amount of turns for your team and the bottom is for the enemy. Later fights in the demo even had modifications made to select measures. What at first seems to be a cosmetic choice seems to actually be one of its best mechanical ideas.</p><p>Management outside of combat allows a lot of creativity as well. <em>People of Note</em>'s Songstone system is a near one-to-one rip of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="83fd60e7-1407-46f1-ac0b-60b876ec8285" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy 7</em></a>'s Materia. That's not a bad thing at all, as it lets you build characters exactly as you want. Even in my hour and a half playtime, I was able to build characters with clear archetypes, with pop star Cadence as my primary damage dealer and the rocker Fret playing support with stat boosts and healing.</p><p>Speaking of characters, the character design is superb. The way Cadence's popstar look clashes with the rock-themed land the demo takes place in makes me really excited about the characters we've yet to meet. The developer at our preview event mentioned that each area in the game is themed after a different genre, and I'm really hoping we get to see a Classical crew decked out with powdered wigs and everything.</p><h2>A Few Sour Notes</h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/freebird-people-of-note-1.jpg?itok=fRe82oO5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/freebird-people-of-note-1.jpg?itok=AcBAziUR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture>Outside of the combat, there were a few places that felt like a miss. The dungeon in the demo felt very ho-hum, and navigating it was a real chore. With a good amount of backtracking required, it was easy to get disoriented in similar looking rooms, and the environmental puzzles were pretty by the numbers. It was nice to look at, but it was mostly repetitive and frustrating.</p><p>My other gripe was with the humor. There are puns <em>everywhere </em>in Note, and they start as fun and make some great environmental gags. In dialogue and songs themselves, though, they don't land quite as well. It's clear there's a sincerity behind the jokes, but it just feels like they're far too frequent. Though perhaps it's a little fitting that a love letter to music has band kid humor.</p><h2>People of Note Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>People of Note </em>went from a relative unknown for me to a game I'm at least intrigued by. I could see its dungeon design and punny dialogue wearing me down quite a bit during its runtime. However, I think its sincerity and sharp systems are interesting and rife with potential.</p><p><em>Guitar Hero </em>was always a love letter to rock. <em>People of Note </em>is striving to be a love letter not to a genre, but to a medium, complete with full musical numbers and loads of variety. It's a huge undertaking, and a big swing for a small team to take. The one certainty I have after my time with <em>People of Note</em>: it's ambitious as hell, and that's enough for me to see it through.</p><hr><p><em><strong>People of Note</strong> was previewed on PC using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of an hour and a half of gameplay.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-f7cce43c-7fff-fe01-2497-c7469a27d0e0">One thing that constantly persisted in my playthroughs of&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>, the self-proposed “horror platformer” published by Ysbryd Games and developed by Brika, was a perversion of wanting. What I wanted wasn’t entirely clear, whether it was an answer, a challenge, cohesion, or even attrition, and even now, 3 playthroughs later, what&nbsp;<em>Love Eternal</em>&nbsp;*<strong>is</strong>* doesn’t necessarily aim itself towards any of those. Could it? Should it? Well, let’s delve deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">What is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/love-eternal-preview-stunning-precision-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Love Eternal</em></a>? Well, in many ways, it’s in the title, but to whom and to what end? Well, all manner of things, if you will. To companionship, creation, celebration, confusion, continuation, cycles, chores, and condemnations. As a product, it’s a buckling beast of wrath, all of it housed inside the cozy visual package of a freeware platformer from the Flash era.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s very unabashed about its inspirations, namely titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/i-wanna-be-guy-remastered-fans-developer-blessing" rel="nofollow"><em>I Wanna Be The Guy</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/celeste" rel="nofollow"><em>Celeste</em></a>, as well as PICO-8 platformers like <em>Pullfrog </em>and… well, <em>Celeste</em>, I suppose, and its slew of mods. Narratively, it seeks to emulate elements of David Lynch’s work, while also somewhat unintentionally running parallel to Joe Dante’s segment in the&nbsp;<em>Twilight Zone</em>&nbsp;movie, which is enticing, but horse before the cart, eh?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/loveeternal_level.jpg?itok=wrnPtgma 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr"><em>Love Eternal</em> itself is an expansion of Brika’s previous hardcore platformer simply titled <em>Love </em>– not to be confused with Fred Wood’s 2008 2D platformer <em>Love</em>. While the latter is much more straightforward, Brika’s <em>Love</em>, and <em>Love Eterna</em>l, have a sneaky ace up their sleeve. At the push of a button, whether stationary or in mid-air, your character will invert their gravity and use the ceiling as their new platform.</p><p dir="ltr">How the game approaches this gimmick is largely through the use of increasing the length of stringing together how many times you can invert in one floating period through the use of red crystals, which refresh your one-time use. There are hazards like spikes and lasers, and these, in turn, close the timings tighter until it becomes more masochistic than precision. A meeting of the minds between its two main inspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">On the whole, this is the game. It is a maximum of three hours of this mechanic stretched to an atomically small width, where the margins get tighter, and the line of red crystals becomes longer. Is it fun? It is initially, before repeat playthroughs, which, due to the narrative, are outright encouraged, undermine how reliant the game is solely on one element of <em>Love Eternal</em>'s platforming possibilities. Instead, what we have is a story to sink our teeth into.</p><picture>

Her reactionary anger to friends like Lacey for failing to show up at an event with Maya, brings the wrath of a selfish god who, unbeknownst to Maya, invites her into a castle hosted of her memories, as fractured and as alien to Maya, as much as they are to the God itself.</p><p dir="ltr">What follows is a spotty, but nonetheless, consistently fascinating string of scenes detailing a lot of this nefarious God’s activity, and a lip service treatment of Maya’s history. Why she’s chosen is just down to bad luck on her part, and as such, <em>Love Eternal </em>is much more interested in detailing how this God interacts with the world around Maya – their new plaything – and their history of previous playthings. The result as a whole, is a memetic experience that is alluring, but aggravatingly impenetrable.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s branded as “an experimental narrative”, but in reality, it is an abstract story, almost completely detached from gameplay, and contextualized through two decades of internet history. If the screenshots fail to garner a reaction other than “buh?”, then just know that they DO make sense, in one very acute angle of how this game structures its writing. Otherwise, you mostly fall prey to this God's absurdist reactions to a world that has gone from temples to touchpads, the Baby Boomer to end all Baby Boomers.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It’s almost pointless trying to adequately compose a consistent chain of events that would make this even remotely make sense. The somewhat garbled memories of Maya intersecting with a previous victim of the God, Divesh, and why the two meet so frequently, when, even when it’s shown, Divesh shows nowhere near the same amount of ire towards his contemporaries like Maya does. Instead, what <em>Love Eternal</em> focuses on is Dadaism.</p><p dir="ltr">Watch! As the God assumes Maya is a girl wholly inspired by the use of 2010 rage comics, one Memebase watermark short of a negative vote rating on 9gag. Gasp! As they react to manga as if it is a coloring book! Chuckle! As the ending of&nbsp;<em>The Blair Witch Project</em>&nbsp;is referenced multiple times in the same scene, but with an irreverence of dopiness behind it! And finally, analog horror jumpscares that shut the game down when finished.</p><p dir="ltr">It should be noted that all of this takes place when the platforming is discarded for a genre switch to a point ‘n click, which falls just shy of being the worst kind of visual novel. Save for an ending which, without spoiling, throws an entirely new angle of commentary towards the player, the platforming element becomes a branch of the statement Brika is trying to make… I think.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Is the mare meant to race? Should the child be coached? What follows these questions are historical context that no longer applies when we, as a collective, have fallen past the need for it. Marriage is no longer a bond of religious intent, but one with protections and privy to the human condition, ultra-modernized. A statement is a JPEG, a playground is a platformer, and you are still you, getting older, and with it, more despondent to a world that doesn’t want you. So you want it, more than food or water. You want it, never need it.</p><p dir="ltr">If that is the intent, it’s an absorbing diatribe, which deserves something a bit more welcoming to synchronicity. Towards the end, Brika seems to lament their creative intent, anger as progression is pushed into the player without the player actively engaging in it, almost furious that there’s a cage around them. Like all animals, they buckle, but to what end? Just living.</p><h2><em>Love Eternal </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2><p dir="ltr">I won’t say that <em>Love Eternal</em> is a great game. Despite its cost-effective batch of content, the reliance on its legitimately bewitching gimmick being one broad stroke of challenge leaves the player desiring more. While the story is a legitimately enthralling aspect, it betrays the supposed experimentation by just sitting alongside the gameplay, and never the two shall meet.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Love Eternal </strong>was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 8 hours of gameplay.
