                <p dir="ltr">Real, lived experiences are some of the strongest influences in art.</p><p dir="ltr">It's AAPI Heritage Month--an annual reminder that Asian and Pacific Islander influences are worth celebrating. AAPI doesn't just include East Asian cultures like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, but a wide range of racial and ethnic groups including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-games-are-lagging-behind-in-south-asian-representation/1100-6503195/">South Asian</a> and Native Hawaiian. As a Filipino-American, I also fall under the AAPI umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">While the term helps rally support and advocacy behind a large chunk of racial and ethnic groups, it can be difficult to define because of that broadness. Those who identify as AAPI often have the perspective of growing up abroad and either coming from a different country or being born to immigrant parents. That opens the door to a unique experience full of its own pros and cons, not quite fitting in with the people from your ethnic group but also not quite fitting in with the foreign culture your family is trying to assimilate into.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an experience that isn't easy to explain in just a few words, though some games manage to get the message across in impactful, meaningful ways. In the past few years, we've enjoyed games from AAPI developers such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/">Venba</a>, 1000xResist, and Butterfly Soup--and those are just the start. Some of these games have AAPI developers directly at the helm and even sometimes feature stories about first- and second-generation AAPI characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of that, games like A Space From The Unbound from Indonesia and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-until-then-showcases-the-beauty-of-filipino-culture/1100-6523531/">Until Then</a> from the Philippines are helping to round out East Asian-heavy representation of the cultures underneath the AAPI umbrella, even if they aren't created by Asians overseas. Both types of games give us powerful narratives to relate to and prove how even those who can't personally relate to AAPI heritage can appreciate other cultures and the depth they bring to a story.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate AAPI month, GameSpot gathered thoughts from AAPI developers and professionals in the gaming industry about what AAPI month means to them and how their identity has shaped their work:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389" data-ratio="0.56217162872154" data-width="1713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389"></a><figcaption>1000xResist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Our whole mission with 1000xRESIST was to see ourselves, and Asian diasporic stories, in-game and on screen, portrayed with dignity. To realize our desire for these stories to be told in ambitious and experimental ways, that held space for dreaming, yearning, and searching. Our identity and lived experiences are such a huge part of the work we make, and we try to lean into the specific as much as possible. This month really reminds me of the kinds of sacrifices the previous generation made, under hostility and discrimination. I don't want to take that for granted, and I want to fight to continue to tell these stories, especially with and for other AAPI creators." -- <strong>Remy Sin, Creative Director of 1000xResist</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"AAPI Month has, in the past, left me feeling a bit complicated as someone who is half Korean and--especially growing up--was unsure how I fit into the celebrations as someone 'in-between.' The ways that games have typically interpreted and portrayed 'Asians' as a monolith honestly didn't help much either. What has helped is media--by AAPI developers--that's highlighted the variations, range, and richness of the Asian-American experience. As cheesy as it sounds, games (like <a href="https://emmkid.itch.io/half" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half</a>, 1000xRESIST, Venba, Butterfly Soup 2) have helped me explore my bi-racial, second-generation identity, and I hope we continue to see more." -- <strong>Jenny Windom, Communications Director, Ivy Road; Co-Owner, Soft Not Weak; Organizer/Host, Wholesome Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Truth be told, AAPI month always felt like a tricky one. You see, most of my life, it always felt like being of Indian descent didn't qualify as 'Asian.' Which is utterly ridiculous because the country is literally in Asia! But even more importantly: 'Asian' celebrations and media usually didn't include people of darker skin tones. I was different but not the 'right kind' of different. The stereotypes and racist remarks that my community was subject to were of violence and filth. On a positive note, though, I do think that diversity culture is slowly changing. I am seeing more people who look like me, with actual personalities, being portrayed on screen. Hey, I even got to write my thoughts for AAPI month on GameSpot, ha!" -- <strong>Neha Patel, Composer/Sound Designer</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There is so much to AAPI heritage, but at the end of the day I'm grateful for the sense of camaraderie and joy we can find in each other. Everything I do now is influenced by the support I was surrounded by in my culture. And as we continue to tell our stories, I hope we see more variety in AAPI developers, aesthetics, and themes." -- <strong>Victoria Tran, Communications Director at Innersloth</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="1366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393"></a><figcaption>Butterfly Soup</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Every project I've worked on contains a small reflection of my Filipino-American identity in hopes that those who interact with it may see a piece of themselves in it, too. Representation is endlessly impactful, especially in an immersive medium like video games. It welcomes more people to feel a sense of belonging, allowing our imagined worlds to reflect the diverse one we live in today. AAPI Heritage Month is always a lovely reminder of how much pride we all have in our unique cultures and how important it is to celebrate and embrace it within our industry!" -- <strong>Belinda Garcia-Maguid, Game Writer and Narrative Designer at Crystal Dynamics</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Three years ago, I met an Asian-American narrative designer for the first time and realized I could also become one. Meeting her broke an imaginary boundary I didn't know I drew between my creative and professional identities, and I remember asking her what it was like being the only AAPI writer on her team. She just shrugged, and said when I joined the industry, there'd be at least two of us. Now, as an early career developer, I'm reminded how representation demonstrates to aspiring AAPI developers that they have a place in games to exist and thrive. Even as the industry struggles, I'm still excited for the day when I can say: 'Well, there's at least three of us.'" -- <strong>Anne Zhang-Huang, Associate Narrative Designer at Zenimax Online Studios</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"My game is set in Ontario in 1914, and I knew that I would be including a Japanese-Canadian character to honour my family heritage. The first wave of Japanese immigrants to Canada started around 1877. My grandmother on my father's side was born in Vancouver in 1912. Representation in our media is so important because historically this representation hasn't been common--d – Despite the fact that diverse populations were and are the reality, more often than not." -- <strong>Julia Minamata, Solo Indie Game Developer of The Crimson Diamond</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"The rising tide of AAPI representation lately fills me with so much pride. In Everything Everywhere All At Once, I saw my mother: from her sensible shoes and puffer vest to her toiling in a mom-and-pop laundromat. In the rise of K-pop, I see people who look like me held up as aspirational figures, influencing generations worldwide in the way they look and dress. I didn't have this growing up, though being born and raised in Los Angeles meant that I never felt like a minority (even though I was, in a numerical sense). In my own work, I'm proud to express my diverse viewpoints with my love of character and emotional conflicts; things that don't scream 'the Asian experience' at the forefront, and yet are made up of references from how I grew up and the traits I value. I love AAPI Heritage Month as a beautiful celebration to highlight all the different voices that make our worlds, both real and fictional, all the more interesting." -- <strong>Karrie Shao, Lead Narrative Designer &amp; Lead Writer of Pacific Drive</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394"></a><figcaption>Pacific Drive</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've lived in the US as a US citizen for 85% of my life and I'm still wondering how long I have to live here to be accepted as an American. As a kid, I assumed things would get better as time went on and never did I think back then attitudes would start going backwards. It's true, if we look back at where racial acceptance was 50 or a 100 years ago, things have gotten better but in my life and where we are, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I see some changes and want a bright future for my teen sons as they navigate their way to adulthood but at the same time I worry. That worry might be just how every parent is with generational divides and the idea of loss and the idea that we won't be around to see our kids' story play out fully into their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I like for them to remember is that their differences in their mixed Asian heritage is what makes them unique and instead of shying away from it like I did as a new immigrant kid learning English for the first time., I want them to own it and be proud of it. It's easier said than done but I have hope. The reason we still (for now) recognize AAPI and other non-dominant cultures is because it's important to understand that the US is a land of diversity and a land of immigrants. People in power tend to forget that this country was not theirs but it was taken by bloody conflict and by force. Dominant culture likes to simplify and establish a very narrow set of rules of what it means to be an American but we know it's more nuanced than that. It's why stories and sharing experiences are important and why we and our studio focuses on games about underrepresented cultures and themes. I'm hopeful, cautiously hopeful and I know I've got to do my part in creating interesting experiences to keep pushing the idea of the variety of people that make up this country." -- <strong>Chandana Ekanayake, Creative Director at Outerloop Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"We've made a lot of strides in representation when it comes to video games. Institutions may not be there yet, but I do believe players are! The love and support our game has gotten stands as testament to that. However, video games are a truly global medium. Too often, discussion of representation is limited to works from the diaspora in the West. I would like to see the industry as a whole make more of an effort to pay attention to and support works from underrepresented regions, too. There is a growing game development scene in South Asia that I'm personally very excited about, and I would love all inclusion efforts to reach farther than the Western-centric approach we default to." -- <strong>Abhi, Creative Director and Founder of Visai Games</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391"></a><figcaption>Venba</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is a time of reflection of our immigrant histories, arts, and the unevenly experienced socioeconomic and civic participation. Although there have been brilliant titles in recent years that highlight the unique challenges faced by the Asian diaspora, we devs have more work ahead of us to highlight that Asian experiences aren't interchangeable and monolithic to both the industry and the public. Just as the census has increased ethnic origin specificity (such as including Hong Kong in the 2021 Canadian census), games deserve representation that reflects the complexity of our cultural and civic preoccupations." -- <strong>Tanya Kan, Executive Producer and Director at Vivid Foundry</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There was a time I provided cultural consultation on a past title. I remember being shown concept art for the villain who was supposed to be an older man. In one of the iterations, he was wearing a taqiyah, which is a prayer cap worn by men in many different countries around the world who follow Islam. I expressed concern over that specific choice because it belongs to a group of minorities who are rarely represented to begin with. I felt having a practicing Muslim man portrayed as the 'bad guy' could send the wrong message and be seen as disrespectful to those who follow Islam. The artist thanked me for the insight and went in a different direction as a result. While there is a wealth of knowledge that we can find online, there is nothing that beats lived experience when it comes to cultural nuances and making sure all minorities are represented correctly and respectfully." -- <strong>Neha Nair, Campaign Marketing Manager at The New Blank</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Games inspire. They inspire players to face challenges creatively; to explore endlessly; to see themselves in unexpected reflections. They inspire gamemakers to design for different minds; to imagine bigger, bolder worlds; to respect the audience's most valuable resource of time. For players and developers both, diversity makes the material for inspiration richer. It widens the pool of perspectives to draw from in making games, and broadens the invitation of play to people across all markers of identity.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the big philosophy, and in practice, my identity has affected my work in treasured ways. It's connected me to fellow devs and players, with precious moments of Pinoy and LGBT pride. It's empowered me to be unafraid in drawing from my own background in what I create. But most importantly, it's made me a stronger, more empathetic, more open-minded observer and listener, who readily welcomes inspiration from others and hopefully inspires others in turn. Happy AAPI Heritage Month and Pride Month! Isang Bagsak!" -- <strong>Isa Mari De Leon, Narrative Writer at Riot Games</strong></p>

            <p>
The end is nigh for developer FuturLab's endlessly hypnotic original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>, but before the studio packs away its nozzles in anticipation of an upcoming sequel, there's one last free update featuring a couple more spaces in which to unleash your hose.
</p>
<p>
"The time has come to reach our final destination for PowerWash Simulator," FuturLab <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">wrote in an update on its website,</a> "and what a journey it has been!... Whether you've been with us busting the grime from early access, or hopped aboard the PowerWash hype train somewhere down the line, we'd love to say a huge thank you for enjoying this adventure with us."
</p>
<p>
And as a final farewell to the original game, FuturLab has released Muckingham Files 6, which features two more locations in desperate need of a clean. The first will be immediately familiar to old hands, taking players down into the Muckingham subway station for one last spray. However, rather than demanding a repeat of the harrowing tunnel clean-up job featured in the base game, this time you'll be aiming your nozzle at an extremely grubby train that's pulled into the station, washing away the grime from its outers and innards.
</p>

<p>
After that, there's one last stop in the form of Sculpture Park, where players will be working at the behest of Darcy d'Arcy to restore the area's collection of "fine" art - including a large Monolith and The Man of A Thousand Faces - to its former glory. And, of course, there's a giant gnome, because what sort of send off would it be without one?
</p>
<p>
"We hope you enjoy this final PowerWash Simulator update as much as we have enjoyed creating it," FuturLab concluded in its update. "The team have poured their hearts and souls into creating a world for you all to escape to and clean, somewhere for you to relax and solo clean, or a place to gather with friends and catch up over a satisfying wash." 
</p>
<p>
PowerWash Simulator's free Muckingham Files 6 update - which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/have-another-peek-at-powerwash-simulator-2-then-hose-down-an-ice-cream-parlour-in-the-original">April's inclusion of Muckingham's Dessert Parlour</a> for a cleaning - is available now on all platforms, and FutureLab has taken the opportunity to squeeze in a couple more bug fixes, as detailed in its <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/news/all-aboard-the-muckingham-files-6-has-arrived-for-powerwash-simulator-s-last-stop">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Next up, of course, is PowerWash Simulator 2, which is currently expected to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">possibly Switch 2</a> later this year. It promises new jobs, new dirt to blast, and a new hub-like HQ. And if you're a fan of PowerWash Simulator's ridiculous narrative, don't fret - FuturLab has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-powerwash-simulator-2-is-bringing-back-the-ludicrous-brilliant-lore">also confirmed plenty more Muckingham lore</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-developer-warns-users-using-latest-graphics-cards-may-experience-frame-rate-drops/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign may not run well at launch on the "latest GPUs", forcing users to reduce graphics settings or resolution to avoid experiencing frame rate drops.</p>
<p>Ahead of the game's release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, Bandai Namco and FromSoftware shared the patch notes for the day one update, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-NIGHTREIGN-Patch101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.01</a>, which improves the handling of playable characters, adjusts the soundtrack, text and balance, adds character scenarios and addresses some unspecified bugs. Accompanying the official patch notes is a warning for PC users that PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops. This issue is under investigation, but anyone experiencing a significant drop is advised to turn down graphics settings from the default High to Medium or Low, or lower the game's resolution.</p>
<p>While it is not specified which new graphics cards currently have trouble running the game properly, it's very likely the Elden Ring Nightreign developer was talking about the NVIDIA RTX 50 series cards, as during my over 30 hours with Elden Ring Nightreign, I did not experience any significant performance issue on an RTX 4080. As such, if you own one of these new GPUs, it may be a good idea to hold off getting the game until the issues have been fixed.</p>
<p>Performance issues on new GPUs and some glaring oversights, such as the lack of cross-platform play, Elden Ring Nightreign is an incredibly engaging experience that masterfully twists the typical Souls series formula to provide a fast-paced co-op experience that is hard to put down. You can learn more about this engaging experience with my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

I was 20 minutes into the demo before I realised that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becoming-saint">Becoming Saint</a> is that most terrible of things, <em>another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a></em>, but that's OK, because by then I'd been burned at the stake for heresy after failing to convert the homely town of Spoleto. The presiding Inquisitor very kindly let me off 100 years of purgatory because I'd mostly rebelled against the Emperor, not the Pope. But then he slapped on 68 years for "minor sins". 
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure which sins. Possibly my being a bit parsimonious with the bread rations on the road to Spoleto? Possibly my favouring the company of a majestic wolf, "strong as he is beautiful"? Regardless, the happy ending here is that after 968 years in purgatory, I was eventually canonised as a Saint in the year 2317. Today, 29th May, is in fact Saint Edwina's day. If you would like Saint Edwina's blessing, know that she accepts all major credit cards and is also happy to be paid in vouchers for Cafe Neros.

<p>
Becoming Saint, then: possibly not the most reverent game you can play. Possibly not a game you will relish if you are a committed Catholic. But quite jolly all the same. The setup here, as I probably should have mentioned about 200 words ago, is that you're a budding preacher in 14th century Italy. Your goal is to Become a Saint within your own lifetime, rather than getting yourself martyred before you can enjoy any of the perks. To do this you will need believers, gathered from 16 social classes.
</p>
<p>
Which believers you attract is based on your own evolving political compass and doctrine, which begins with the three narrative choices you make at the outset. For example, choice of familiar. I picked a wolf as my animal emblem and promised the faithful all the florins they could eat, which got me branded a Capitalist, but your alignment can shift as you give speeches at towns over the course of the run. This may cause some believers to peel away and others to latch on. The presentation is eye-grabbing: pop-up cardboard towns, menus written on parchment scrolls, choose-your-own adventure beats with Kate Beaton-esque illustrations. A little like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>, in places, but simpler and bolder.
</p>
<p>
You can anoint up to five types of believer as followers, which allows you to field them in "confrontations" with opposing zealots while trying to convert towns. These confrontations take the form of grid-based real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> battles with a tactical pause function. Units have three stats and some Rosary, Paper, Censer-style strengths and weaknesses. Book-wielding Monks are great at perplexing Peasants, for example. Other followers excel at begging, which is important because your holy cause is powered by bread as much as charisma.
</p>
<p>
It's all the antic and disarming work of Open Lab Games, developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roller-drama">Roller Drama</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-drama">Football Drama</a>. You can find that demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643010/Becoming_Saint/">Steam</a>, along with the release date: 15th July 2025.

                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford continues to speak out regarding the price point of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">remains a mystery</a>. Posting on social media, Pitchford said that first and foremost he does not want people to pay "any more than they should or are comfortable with." He's saying this after he controversially said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to find $80 to buy Borderlands 4 if it costs that much.</p><p>"I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p><p>With his "real fans" comment, Pitchford said he was responding to a person who suggested Borderlands 4 would "fail" at $80.</p><p>"What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn't my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that's obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it's a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it," he said.</p><p>He said he "triggered some people" by using the phrase "real fans," going on to push back against the idea that he was trying to make "some big statement."</p><p>"I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel)," he said.</p><p>Pitchford went on to say that, as an artist, he doesn't want to see price increases because that might limit how many people could play it. At the same time, Pitchford is a businessman and he said he understands that "business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up."</p><p>"Sooner or later we're going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content," he said.</p><p>Speaking at PAX, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><p>2K, the publisher of Borderlands 4, will set the price of Borderlands 4. Exactly what that price will be remains a mystery and may not be confirmed until preorders open.</p><p>Nintendo is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">charging $80 for Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising prices to $80 as well</a> for some games later this year. Another 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, is going to sell for $50 as part of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">intentional bid to appeal to players who don't have a lot of free time.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 releases on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's coming to Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> as well, but there is no release date yet.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/" data-ref-id="1100-6528323">Metaphor: ReFantazio won GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year Award</a>, and earned a 10/10 score in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/" data-ref-id="1900-6418297">GameSpot's Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>. Reviewer Jessica Cogswell called the RPG "transcendent" and "greater than the sum of its parts," even when those parts are each "masterfully crafted."</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the fantasy world of Euchronia, players set out on a secret mission to assassinate a tyrannical would-be ruler, only for the entire kingdom to be thrown into political upheaval. Soon players are thrust into a competition to become the kingdom's next monarch, and along the way are joined by a ragtag group of heroes representing Euchronia's various fantasy races as they all seek to make the world a better place.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio is every bit as stylish as Atlus' previous Persona work, with some of the most impressive menus and animations ever seen in a turn-based RPG. Persona fans will feel right at home with Metaphor's combat, too, which sees characters transform into different Archetypes to use unique powers. It also sports a standout soundtrack that feels unique to its fantasy universe yet still familiar to composer Shoji Meguro's previous Atlus work.</p><p dir="ltr">Other big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/more-new-game-pass-titles-for-may-2025-include-2024s-best-and-day-one-releases/2900-6599/" data-ref-id="2900-6599">Game Pass additions in May</a> have included the newly released Xbox first-party title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and indie sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-train-2/" data-ref-id="5000-663832">Monster Train 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-joins-game-pass-today-as-battle-for-brooklyn-expansion-and-year-7-launches/1100-6531831/" data-ref-id="1100-6531831">The Division 2 (alongside the new Battle for Brooklyn expansion)</a> and the new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-to-a-t-launches-in-may/1100-6529669/" data-ref-id="1100-6529669">To a T</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/katamari-damacy/" data-ref-id="5000-19797">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

Each character boasts a unique skillset to challenge players to master different gameplay styles. Battle the hordes of the underworld on an assortment of playable maps drawing from various locales from the mythological story of Achilles such as Troy and Tartarus. Level up your character during each run to elevate them from hero to god of destruction as you gain stronger power-ups and abilities. Increase overall team stats between runs to increase your odds of winning the fight against Hades’ minions as you confront more lethal monsters and bosses.</p><p>Following the Trojan War, Hades, the god of the underworld, resurrected Achilles to use him in a conflict against the other gods. Once Achilles had served his purpose, Hades betrayed him, casting him into the depths of Tartarus and condemning him to eternal torment. Refusing to accept this fate, Achilles broke free from the underworld, rescuing many lost souls, including several who had fallen to his own sword. Angered by this defiance, Hades unleashed his dark minions to hunt down Achilles and all the souls he freed. Take on the mantle of Achilles or one of the many others rescued from Tartarus and prepare for a fight that will take you beyond the land of the living in the hopes of thwarting Hades and his army of the damned.</p><!-- AD: content -->

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, developer Unknown Worlds' exquisite deep sea survival game, is making its way to iOS and Android devices this July, meaning you'll finally be able to play it <em>actually underwater</em> (as long as your phone is waterproof, so please do check that first).
</p>
<p>
Subnautica, for some context, originally lauched in 2018 after a couple of years in early access, taking players on a mostly combat-free adventure far, far beneath the waves after crash landing on the ocean planet 4546B. It managed to combine its various strands of exploration, narrative, crafting, base building, and thalassophobia-inducing horror into a deeply satisfying whole, and ended up being a critical and commercial hit. So much so that a standalone expansion - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a> - followed, and a sequel's on the way.
</p>
<p>
But back to Subnautica's iOS and Android release. It's being created in collaboration with mobile developer Playdigious and promises the full-fat Subnautica experience - the one Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-review">called</a> "oppressively beautiful" and "well-wrought" back in 2018 - albeit with some mobile-specific tweaks. It's got an updated UI, for instance, alongside touch controls and support for MFi controllers if you'd rather play with proper buttons. That's in addition to iPhone 15 optimisation, GameCenter achievements on iOS, and cloud save support enabling progress to be share between iOS or Android devices.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Here's a quick look at Subnautica's mobile release.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL6HobdRpVQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
If all that appeals, Subnatica comes to iOS and Android on 8th July (via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/subnautica/id6478639011">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unknownworlds.subnautica">Google Play</a> respectively) for the entirely reasonable price of $9.99 USD. In fact, it'll be even cheaper for a limited time, given the 10 percent launch discount that'll bring it down to $8.99.
</p>
<p>
As for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, that's currently set to launch into early access later this year. Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">shared a tiny bit of first gameplay back in April</a>, showing off a handful of new environments, some new aquatic creatures, and even a bit of base-building and co-operative swimming. Co-op is, of course, the sequel's big new feature, and it'll support up to four players. Subnautica 2 will initially be available for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and GamePass, and is expected to stay in early access for "about two to three years."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rebellion has announced that it’s British post apocalyptic survival game Atomfall will be getting bigger with the launch of its Wicked Isle story expansion DLC, which will be available from June 3rd. Those who purchased the Atomfall Deluxe Edition will get instant access to the new story content, as will those who buy the Deluxe upgrade pack which is available for £14.99, €19.99, or $19.99. The launch trailer for Atomfall Wicked Isle can be watched now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Wicked Isle DLC Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HdforNUuuE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Atomfall’s Wicked Isle story takes place on Midsummer Island, which is close to the site of Windscale Atom Plant. As a result those who reside on the island and the environment have been subject to higher infection levels compared to those in Wyndham Village and the surrounding areas. The new content adds new enemies including pirates and druids, as well as more weapons to add to your arsenal including the Blunderbuss shotgun. New skills will also be available for your character to use. Wicked Isle is not a standalone story, but weaves into the main story beats of the main game. So much so, that new endings have been added to take into account the events that take place on Midsummer Island.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Atomfall review, Gareth said,<em> “Atomfall is an interesting game. It might not be wholly unique in anything it does, but it combines its core ideas in a way that feels fresh. A big part of that comes through the drip feed of the underlying story, whilst another is the glorious British countryside that makes up its maps. It likely isn’t going to blow your mind, but it’s an enjoyable journey and you would still be missing out if you didn’t give Atomfall a go.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/674523/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Tiger Borgia, a content creator focused on cozy games, has been pulling weeds in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> for over five years. </p><p>Given the current landscape in which game developers constantly release new updates to vie for the attention of audiences, Borgia’s dedication to <em>New Horizons</em> can come across as admirable. Nintendo has not released a major update to <em>New Horizons </em>since the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC in 2021. (Just this week <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/49112/~/how-to-update-animal-crossing%3A-new-horizons">the game was patched</a> in advance of the Switch 2.) The version of <em>New Horizons</em> Borgia plays today — the one where she pulls weeds and fishes each day — is more or less the same game that the company released in the spring of 2020. </p><p>At a time when seemingly every publisher is trying to capture a piece of the lucrative live-service boom, <em>New Horizons</em> showed Nintendo slowly inching its way into the space with more than a year’s worth of regular updates after launch. And that expansion into live service is something that could become an even larger part of Nintendo’s future with the Switch 2.</p><p>Speaking to <em>The Verge</em>, Borgia explains that two years ago she would have said yes to having more content in <em>New Horizons</em>, but her opinion has since changed. “Now I feel like the game should be left as is,” Borgia says via email. “<em>New Horizons</em> already had its moment. I would be open to the next Animal Crossing title being a live-service game, but I would be skeptical about paywalls and subscription fees.”</p><p>Since the release of <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>in 2017, live-service games have become a core pillar of modern gaming. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-09-29/why-playstation-fans-are-cheering-ceo-jim-ryan-s-departure">Live-service games</a> — or what some call “games as a service” — don’t have a clear start and end. Instead, developers release a base game and continue to put out updates that add new characters, game modes, and other content to try and get people to play as much as possible.</p><p>The model has become a massively popular way to monetize games. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lj27nkyes22r">Industry analyst Mat Piscatella</a> published data saying more than 40 percent of all time spent playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles in the US in the month of January was spent playing the top 10 live-service games. And the trend has hit the developer side too: a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">2025 survey from the Game Developers Conference</a> found that roughly 30 percent of all “AAA” developers are working on a live-service game. </p><p>Despite all the big numbers, Nintendo has been selective with the live-service games it develops. Creating a live-service game isn’t as easy as flipping a switch, and even major companies like Sony have struggled to enter the space; it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects">recently shut down development on two such projects</a>. However, some fans are wondering if that could change with the Switch 2. </p><p>Previous titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>have already gotten live-esque service with regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23683377/splatoon-3-splatfest-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom">updates and events</a> — even if the earlier entries in the series were ultimately shut down. And <em>New Horizons</em> received a steady stream of updates initially. New features, like the Switch 2’s Discord-like social tool GameChat, could benefit live-service games that rely on online communication and logging in with friends regularly to play. Additionally, leaks from an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">October playtest</a> suggested that Nintendo could be working on some sort of MMO for the Switch 2, which could also fall under the umbrella of a live-service game. </p><p>But here is the most compelling argument that a shift could be on the horizon: Nintendo has already been investing in live-service games for years. If you look at Nintendo’s mobile games, entries like <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> already used a free-to-play model with in-game transactions at launch.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Some Animal Crossing fans welcome the possibility of adapting the mainline games to a live-service model. <em>New Horizons</em> is really good for people who like to get creative and design an island, but the game can run out of new content after players complete certain tasks and storylines.</p><p>Tom, an artist who played the game for more than two years, tells <em>The Verge</em> a live-service version of the game could have kept him playing even longer. “More updates would have made it <em>way</em> more likely that I’d have kept going, especially because it would keep friends coming back too,” he says<em>.</em></p><p>Additionally, the gameplay and structure of <em>New Horizons </em>could be the perfect fit for a live-service game, since it has seasonal events depending on the time of year and the region you play in. However, some of the fans I spoke to expressed skepticism. </p><p>“I was never expecting to get infinite content from Animal Crossing honestly,” Christi Kerr, a player who spent more than 700 hours playing <em>New Horizons</em>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “I was used to old AC games where all the content came out at once, and you play it until you feel like you’ve done all you want. I thought the updates to <em>New Horizons</em> were fun, but also kind of frustrating as a <em>New Leaf</em> player.”</p><p>That’s not to say that players <em>The Verge</em> spoke to are completely closed off to the live-service model with the next mainline Animal Crossing game; it just needs to be done in a way that feels respectful to players’ time, money, and attention. Today, even beloved live-service games are regularly criticized by fans for requiring too much time to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteXPMaps/comments/1h45vb0/leveling_up_this_season_so_far_doesnt_seem_so_easy/">level up a battle pass</a> or for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/wa1348/patch_28_has_the_worst_puzzle_designs_in_genshin/">poorly designed events</a>. </p><p>“If Animal Crossing were to consider a live-service approach, I really hope that they would focus on seasonal events and quality-of-life updates,” Borgia says. “I would be nervous to say I hope for continuous new content like furniture and clothing, because that can easily turn into a microtransaction nightmare. I’d love to have more seasonal celebrations, challenges, and temporary NPC visitors.”</p><p>So far, Nintendo has shown a measured approach to live-service games. In the case of <em>Pocket Camp</em>, Nintendo ended up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions">rereleasing it as a standalone game</a> free of microtransactions. Now, people who missed the boat on playing <em>Pocket Camp</em> initially and don’t like in-app purchases can still play the same game. </p><p>For the fans we spoke to, this is good enough. Animal Crossing doesn’t need to be some sort of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23583539/back-4-blood-content-updates-expansion-packs-good">never-ending forever game</a> that trudges on like a zombie throughout the years. As Kerr put it, it’s totally fine to have a game start and end, and then get a new one down the line. </p><p>“I would’ve been delighted to see updates like a live service game. [...] But like I said, I’m not bothered if the next Animal Crossing game sustains my interest for a while and then I’m done.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, with a brand new console on the horizon, what better time to look back at some of the legendary publisher’s greatest games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For decades, Nintendo has given us some of the most famous and best-selling game series ever made, but here, I’ve picked out 18 of the most well-known ones to sort through. Yes, this list could stretch into the 100s, but we don’t want to be here all day, do we? From Super Mario to Zelda, we all have our favourites, and some (sorry Kirby) that we’ve just never quite clicked with. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account <strong>my personal enjoyment</strong> of each series over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/29/screenshot-2025-05-29-at-13-38-28-1748522322130.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Simon Cardy's Nintendo Series Tier List</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m sure it’s no surprise to see both Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda in my S-tier category. Two of the most influential and, crucially, very fun video game series to ever do it, it’s a no-brainer really. On the other end of the scale… I’m sure a few eyebrows will be raised at my placing of Super Smash Bros. in the C tier. Please let me explain myself before battering me in the comments, please. Smash Bros. has just never been my thing, I’m afraid. Not only am I not a fighting game fan, but in a time when lots of people grew up playing it with friends, I was simply enjoying other multiplayer and party games, whether those be TimeSplitters, Guitar Hero, or Call of Duty. I just don’t have the connection to Smash Bros. that so many do, and for that, I can only ask for your complete forgiveness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Pikmin is better than Pokémon? Well, why not have a go at ranking some of Nintendo’s biggest series yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community. </p><div id="nintendo-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Series Tier List</h3><h3>Nintendo Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s your favourite Nintendo series that hasn’t made it onto this list?

                <p>Subscription services for video games have grown over the years, but former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has expressed concern about them. In an interview, Yoshida spoke about how the expansion of first-party titles could eventually lead to third-party studios being shut out of subscription services, as the companies could prefer to hedge their bets with a growing library of first-party releases instead of experimental games.</p><p>"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions, that's really dangerous because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," Yoshida said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" rel="nofollow ">Game Developer at Gamescom LATAM</a>. "That's really, really risky because there must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</p>

<p>Yoshida added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases to its PlayStation Plus service after they've been on the market for a certain amount of time. Once sales have tailed off on a first-party game, it usually finds its way onto PS Plus, thus allowing more people to experience it for the first time.</p><p>In comparison, Microsoft's main selling point for Xbox Game Pass is that games developed by its internal studios are day-one releases on its subscription program, and third-party games have also been included in this strategy. So far, 2025 has seen day-one launches of big titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Doom: The Dark Ages, and South of Midnight on Xbox Game Pass. The releases have been fairly diverse as well, with games like Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush joining traditional fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Forza Motorsport.</p><p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">was also "immediately profitable,"</a> and the studio recently spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. At the same time, another developer has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/" data-ref-id="1100-6514084">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also clarified its own statements on the service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">potentially cannibalizing game sales</a>.</p><p>Yoshida did praise Microsoft for its backwards compatibility, a feat of engineering that he called "smart and very well planned" for its subscribers. PS Plus--and Xbox Game Pass--will be home to a day-one third-party release in June, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">Remedy Entertainment's FBC: Firebreak will be available through those services</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-may-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6587/">PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue was also updated this week</a> with a few more titles, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/">June's PS Plus games</a> includes a few recent titles from 2024 like the Alone in the Dark remake, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, and NBA 2K25.</p>

                <p>A federal court has blocked US President Donald Trump's plans to institute major global tariffs, a plan announced in April that sent global markets into a frenzy. Trump attempted to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariffs, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a three-judge panel rejected this</a>. What all of this means for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and other gaming products, however, is unknown at the moment.</p><p>The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit, however.</p><p>The US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor Ilya Somin, who worked on a related tariff case, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/federal-court-strikes-down-trumps-april-2-tariffs-00373843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Politico</a>, "Anybody that has had to pay tariffs so far will be able to get them refunded."</p><p>The US Justice Department is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.</p><p>Nintendo cited Trump's tariffs as one of the reasons why Switch 2 preorders were initially delayed. While the Switch 2 price remains at $450, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some accessories.</a> Microsoft raised Xbox console prices, citing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">"market conditions,"</a> but without mentioning tariffs specifically. Sony, for its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/" data-ref-id="1100-6530829">raised PS5 prices in April.</a> Tabletop gaming companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-game-publisher-is-very-publicly-suing-trump-administration-over-tariffs/1100-6531040/" data-ref-id="1100-6531040">affected by the tariffs</a>, too.</p><p>Whether or not gaming companies were baking the tariffs into their price increases is unclear; also unclear is whether or not companies will offer refunds. </p><p>Gaming companies might raise prices for any number of reasons, beyond a potential impact of tariffs. For example, experts agree that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay more</a> for their favorite products because the data shows they will. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, adjusted for inflation, and Nintendo might be charging more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because people will pay it</a>.</p>

<p>Testing a single player expedition, it would appear the balance adjustments have made it slightly easier. While enemies are still aggressive, their health seems lower and my character stats appeared to be higher.</p>
<p>Of course, it could be my skill level has increased over the review period. But even a half-arsed run got me two thirds through the first Nightlord boss, which wouldn't have happened previously, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p>Still, I wouldn't take this as a sign that solo play is a viable option to complete the game. It's still very much intended to be a multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>One obvious improvement, though, is the "improved handling of playable characters", which relates to the game's parkour movement. It's now much cleaner jumping up the side of cliffs.</p>
<p>The remaining changes will need to be tested over a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-sales-pass-30m">30m selling game</a>. It's out tomorrow across PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam). Note that crossplay between platforms is not included.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off is an exhilarating rush and a celebration of the studio's prior achievements Souls veterans will devour," I wrote in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Elden Ring Nightreign review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Squad 22: ZOV</a> is a new squad tactics game that just released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-did-not-suffer-a-security-breach-and-you-dont-need-to-change-your-password-says-valve/">Steam</a> yesterday, and claims to be "<em>officially recommended</em>" by the Russian military "<em>for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training<strong>.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>, the game's <a href="https://squad22.online/">website</a> claims that the development team includes soldiers currently fighting in the war between Ukraine and Russia, and claims that it shows "<em>History as it</em> <em>is.</em>"</p>
<p>The website reads,"<em>Dive into 2014 and 2022-2024 events, through different campaigns and learn how people who lived in them saw what happened, how it affected their lives and changed opinions</em>."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/rf-en/how-russia-militarizes-youth-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation</a> has already published articles about Squad 22: ZOV, and how it is Russian military propaganda that aims to "<em>mythologize the war and its participants</em>" from Russia's point of view, to bring young Russian men into the fold of the army.</p>
<p>"<em>The Squad 22: ZOV game is not just entertainment, but an element of propaganda aimed at justifying the war and creating a heroic myth about the Russian</em> <em>military,</em>" the Center for Countering Disinformation writes.</p>
<p>"<em>This is another step in the militarization of Russian society and its preparation for a long-term war.</em>"</p>
<p>It's unclear how exactly Squad 22: ZOV was able to get its Steam listing and pass through moderation checks. Valve has not yet commented on the game, nor has it taken action to remove the game like it recently did with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-game-promoting-sexual-assault-removed-from-sale-in-uk-australia-and-canada/">game explicitly depicting sexual violence</a>, or how it removed a game depicting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">conflict between Israel and Palestine</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-brings-evidence-overhaul-and-more-in-june.1201569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has revealed the release date for the next major&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>update, which will bring a rework to the evidence system and more next month.</p>

<p>Arriving on June 24th, the Chronicle update will introduce "a total overhaul of evidence collection", according to Kinetic, along with three new evidence types, a redesign for the journal, and a new UI for the main menu.</p>

<p>One of the new evidence types, Sound, will require you to use the brand new Sound Recorder device to capture subtle audio cues in your environment. Each tier allows you to detect "deeper layers of audio", with ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and paranormal sounds all available to be recorded.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=Mf8ajJun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-staircase.jpg?itok=N4fnReB3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New evidence types are available for you to collect in the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>Chronicle update, due in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As for the journal, it's getting a complete redesign. The "Photos" tab is being replaced by one titled "Media", which will house your proof, including photos and videos you've taken, as well as the new Sound category.</p>

<p>If you want to complete an investigation, you'll have to fill your journal with different types of evidence, and you can look forward to "new paranormal moments to capture", including EMF spikes and "fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms".</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update also brings an overhaul to the way evidence works; the first instance of each media type captured will be marked as "Unique", while subsequent captures will be marked as "Duplicates", and smaller rewards will be given for those.</p>

<p>Other changes in Chronicle include a reworked leveling and progression system (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-ascension-update-release-date" rel="nofollow">yes, another one</a>), as well as a new main menu UI that should make navigating&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s options easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-journal-rework.jpg?itok=c-ZvZna6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-chronicle-update-journal-rework.jpg?itok=V9JkYuPr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s journal system is being reworked in the Chronicle update.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the Chronicle update, the previously-revealed Grafton Farmhouse rework will be released; we don't have a release date for it yet, but it'll bring "updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic" to the map.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s Chronicle update lands on June 24th. The game is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-brings-new-area-and-more-next-week.1201566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced that the first major piece of story DLC for&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>, will be launching next week. It'll be purchasable separately if you don't own the Deluxe Edition, but if you do, you'll already have access to it.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>launches on June 3rd. It'll add&nbsp;a new location to&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>in the form of Midsummer Island, and while you're there, you'll also uncover new weapons, new leads, and even new endings.</p>

<p>As you've probably already surmised,&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>is built heavily around&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s folk horror elements; if you haven't played the main game yet, I won't spoil, but suffice it to say you're not just dealing with bandits and trigger-happy military types.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=pWwwjFPe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-release-date.jpg?itok=8pakGODG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall</em>'s Wicked Isle DLC is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Head of design Ben Fisher says that because Midsummer is closer to the Windscale plant than the rest of&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s world, "the levels of infection in both the people and the environment are higher than on the mainland".</p>

<p>As such, you'll be encountering new enemy factions, some of which may be too infected to reason with. A new pirate bandit faction will also be present on Midsummer, and it'll be up to you how you deal with them.</p>

<p>New weapons include a blunderbuss, a new bow, and "the Beekeeper's Staff", which feels to me like a not-so-subtle reference to Nic Cage's terrible 2006 remake of the British folk horror classic&nbsp;<em>The Wicker Man</em>.</p>

<p>Not only that, but new skills will also be available, and you'll be able to use your new upgraded metal detector to help you find loot caches with even more useful stuff in them. In short, if you love&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, you'll probably love this as well.</p>




<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>proved popular at launch, reaching <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-player-count-1m-stats" rel="nofollow">a million players by its first weekend</a> (having been released on the Game Pass service on day one).</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/atomfall/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9NC4WDL5KZBL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle&nbsp;</em>will be launching across all three platforms on June 3rd. Make sure to check out our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-review-british-invasion" rel="nofollow">review of the base game</a> to see what she thought of it.</p>

Alongside Switch 2 support comes new features, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes">first announced in early April</a>, making it easier to access screenshots on other devices and adding mobile notifications for GameChat invitations.</p><p>The most useful update to the app is that the Switch 2 will be able to upload screenshots and videos to it through the cloud. The Switch 2’s album will have a new Upload to Smart Device option for manually sending screenshots, as well as an automatic uploads feature where the 100 most recent screenshots and videos on the console will be available in the app.</p><p>Files will be stored in the cloud for up to 30 days, Nintendo says, but can be downloaded from the app to a mobile device’s camera roll to be saved permanently. If you attempt to upload more than 100 screenshots and videos, the oldest screenshots will be overwritten. A free Nintendo Account is required to use the feature, but a paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is not.</p><p>Sharing screenshots from the original Switch was a more cumbersome process requiring a smartphone to scan a QR code on the console and then connect to a temporary Wi-Fi network to transfer the files wirelessly.The Nintendo Switch App will also let you see when you’ve been invited to a GameChat call and includes the Zelda Notes features for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. Although not active in the app yet, the feature will include achievements, spoken directions to areas you mark on a map, and access to additional Princess Zelda recall memories.</p><p>The Nintendo Today app also received an update today with new features including the ability to link its calendar with your own calendar app so you can see upcoming Nintendo events and game release dates as part of your personal schedule. There’s also the option to favorite content and filter news so you only see what you’re interested in, and the app now lets you zoom in on images.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This fresh mechanic will add a new dimension to gameplay, revealing subtle clues that might otherwise be drowned out by terrified screams. Available in three upgrade tiers (T1, T2, and T3), this new equipment unlocks deeper layers of audio detection, as players will be able to record audio from ghost events, Spirit Box responses, and Paranormal Sounds like those detected by the Parabolic Microphone.</p><p><strong>Journal Overhaul</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The “Chronicle” update will redefine how ghost hunters gather evidence. The journal will get a full redesign, where the Photos tab will be replaced by a brand-new Media tab. This tab will organize all captured proof into three sections—Photos, Videos, and new Sound Recordings—offering a richer, more immersive investigation experience where players can log photographic, visual, and new haunting audio evidence all in one place. Investigators will now need to fill a full book of unique media to complete a perfect investigation, with new paranormal moments to capture—from EMF spikes to ghostly interactions and fleeting glimpses of otherworldly forms.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/unnamed.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Redesigned Evidence System</strong></p><p>“Chronicle” will also introduce a revamped media quality system. The first evidence capture of any media type will be marked as “Unique”, granting extra cash and XP rewards at the end of each contract. Any subsequent captures of the same evidence type will be classed as “Duplicates”, offering smaller rewards. The new system will also add tier bonuses based on the equipment used and adds all media captures into the Reward Multiplier, making every shot, sound, and sight count even more toward player’s final payouts.</p><p><strong>…And More!</strong></p><p>In addition to the evidence collection overhaul, Sound Recorder, and revamped media quality system, the “Chronicle” update will introduce a reworked levelling and progression system, and a brand-new Main Menu user interface. Behind the scenes, the <em>Phasmophobia</em> team has also been hard at work exorcising bugs to polish the experience for players—and there are still plenty of secrets waiting to be uncovered when the update drops.</p><p>This year, <em>Phasmophobia</em> will also see the highly-anticipated rework to Grafton Farmhouse, following Bleasdale Farmhouse’s recent overhaul. Grafton, an abandoned, crumbling home, will soon feature updated visuals, redesigned layouts, re-themed rooms, and a haunting new attic. The revamped Grafton Farmhouse arrives after “Chronicle”—stay tuned for release details!</p></blockquote><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [235 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,259 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.
