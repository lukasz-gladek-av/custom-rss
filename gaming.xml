<p>Well, here's another port that we weren't expecting. Despite teeing off on other systems back in February, 2K Sports has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> will also be swinging onto Switch 2 at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Yep, we were a little vague about a release date there, and it was completely intentional. We know that the latest PGA Tour entry is coming our way <em>sometime</em> down the line, but we have no specifics on when, just yet.</p>
<p>But hey, it's exciting news. The Switch 2 version will support all of the game modes you can find on other systems, including MyCAREER, cross-platform online Societies, a Course Designer and more. The latest entry in 2K's golf series packs all kinds of fancy new swing tech, with EvoSwing or Perfect Swing options for veterans and newbies alike, and there's also the chance to play in Major Championship venues, Quail Hollow Club, Oakmont Country Club, and Royal Portrush Golf Club for the first time in series history.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of Switch 2 screenshots from 2K:</p>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for the all-important release date over the coming months. With this joining the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K</a>, there's no denying that Switch 2 is quickly becoming quite the console for sports games.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have delivered a timely reminder that AI isn’t just effective at injecting ugly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">soulless</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">anti-art</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-player-convinces-one-of-the-games-npcs-theyre-pregnant-with-his-baby">nonsense robochat</a> into your games – it also has the power to ruin your entire PC.</p>
<p>MS recently <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">updated a support article</a> explaining the 'agentic AI' features they plan to roll out for Windows 11, which involve creating a separate desktop instance and allowing AI 'agents' to perform supposedly menial tasks (like file sorting and email sending) within it. All while you kick back on your main workspace, online shopping for the third yacht that the AI revolution has surely enabled you to afford. Unfortunately, among the agents’ capabilities is the risk of installing malware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, the article warns that agentic AI may "introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.” Sounds awful. Terrible! Clearly not the kind of vulnerability that Microsoft could possibly allow to stand and oh no wait they’re going through with it anyway, with the first experimental versions already being live via the Windows Insider programme.</p>
<p>There are token safeguards: the 'agent workspace' is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by someone with admin privileges. But it’s hardly reassuring when the only way to use these features safely is to <em>not</em> use them, at all. And you would stay at effectively zero risk of XPIA attacks if you didn't, as these types of malware are engineered to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">target large language models</a> (LLMs) rather than humans.</p><p>It’s likely inevitable that Windows 11 will swell up with agentic AI at some point; Microsoft have been talking about it for months, and with Windows 10 having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">lost (of all things) its security updates</a>, it’s not like fleeing to the older OS is a long-term alternative. But putting it in users’ hands when the AI involved hasn’t been sufficiently trained to avoid obvious, often plain-English phishing or malware injection scams is <em>spectacular</em> arrogance. Unless it’s some kind of Valve inside job to make us all buy SteamOS-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machines</a>, but I’m not sure their wheelie desks would roll that far.</p>
<p>Motoring critics often use the phrase "Car Brain" to illustrate how otherwise rational, sensible drivers suddenly lose their empathy and perception functions as soon as they sit behind a steering wheel. I’d like to propose the usage of "AI Brain" to describe the phenomena of ostensibly intelligent technologists instantly abandoning any sense of responsibility, creativity, good product design, and in many cases, basic human decency the minute they have artificial intelligence in front of their face. AI Brain can be easily identified through symptoms such as excessive LinkedIn posting and the vocalisation of gibberish about how their company <em>needs</em> to steal other people’s work, actually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning an outdoor adventure or just live in an area that’s prone to power outages, having a power station at hand can be a true lifesaver. The best options out there not just keep your essentials charged, but are also easy to carry around.</p>
<p>EcoFlow makes some of our favorite portable options, and Amazon is making it easy to grab one without shelling out thousands of dollars.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/"> Right now, you can grab the EcoFlow Delta 2 power station for just $349, after a massive 50% off its retail price.</a> It’s one of the lowest drops we’ve seen in a while, but it won’t last long. If you’ve been holding off on buying backup power, this is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports to Juice All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>This mighty station offers up to 1800W of output to power 90% of your home appliances. It comes with 15 ports in total, which include 6 AC outlets (1800W, 2700W surge), 2 USB-C (100W), 2 USB-A (12W), 2 USB-A Fast Charge (18W), 2 DC5521 (38W), and 1 car charger port (126W). That’s enough to power your smartphone, laptop, fridge, projector, and even a coffee maker at the same time.</p>
<p>It can prepare you for up to two days of backup during a power outage. For reference, the EcoFlow Delta 2 can keep a refrigerator (120W) going for up to 14 hours, power a CPAP machine (40W) for 17 hours, run a light (10W) for up to 98 hours, and even let you heat food in a microwave for up to 0.6 hours.</p>



<p>Its LFP(LiFePO4) battery delivers more than 3,000 charge cycles and is built to last for years. Recharging the power station can be done in multiple ways. You can charge the EcoFlow Delta 2 from 0 to 100% in just 1.3 hours using a wall outlet. It also supports solar (2.3 hrs), car, and smart generator charging. Overall, the recharging time is about 7 times faster than many other units in this range, so it should be up and running again in no time.</p>
<p>The box comes with everything you need to get started, including the EcoFlow Delta 2 portable power station, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and an exclusive 5-year customer service for some extra peace of mind. It’s better to get your orders in quickly, as the deal can vanish at any moment now.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo GameCube’s <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> seems to have become more popular in people’s memories than it was on its 2003 launch. The racing game from HAL Laboratory and&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> legend&nbsp;Masashiro Sakurai was received with a collective “meh,” reviewers frustrated by its simplicity in a world where <em>Mario Kart</em> ruled. This seems to have done little to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">dampen excitement</a> around the game’s very belated return, this time in the hands of Bandai Namco and Sora, complete with Masashiro Sakurai at the helm. And it seems to have worked out a lot better 22 years later, with&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> winning over a majority of critics.</p> <p>The game’s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kirby-air-riders/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2">current Metascore of 78</a> isn’t what Sora or Nintendo would have been hoping for, but it’s a fair reflection of the 57 reviews in so far (Nintendo did not supply&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> with review code), with its vast majority of 7s, 8s and 9s. Funnily enough, 78 is exactly where&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-switch-2-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-reviews-metacritic-2000641055"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></a> landed earlier this month, a number that has only snuck up to 79 since its release. Also aligning is each game’s harshest review, with both getting a huge outlier score of 4 out of 10 and verbal kicking from the anonymous critic at the UK’s&nbsp;<em><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/">Metro Game Central</a></em>. (<em>Metro</em> is owned by Associated Newspapers, the same company that owns the&nbsp;<em>Daily Mail</em>.) Meanwhile, I suspect that had Julia Lee’s review on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>Polygon</em></a> had a score it could have weighted things up significantly, given she describes the game as “everything I could have wanted and more.”&nbsp;<em>Siliconera</em>‘s Jenni Lada was equally jubilant, with a 10/10 score and the declaration that she likes it more than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>!</p>

 <p>Most took a more moderate view, however, a huge number of the reviews beginning by their confusion that that is of all GameCube games should be the one picked for a modern revival, but pleasantly surprised by the results. “This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there’s no doubt,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>‘s PJ O’Reilly, “but it’s got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards.” O’Reilly admits that he had a soft spot for the original, while acknowledging its flaws, and observing that the sequel is “actually very good.” <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a>‘s Chris Scullion says that while the game begins “insultingly simple,” it quickly reveals hidden depths and has a “brilliant single-player Road Trip mode.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>The Sixth Axis</em></a>‘s Dominic L was a little more hesitant with praise, criticizing&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>‘ City Trial mode but celebrating its top-down Top Ride perspective, eventually concluding that while falling short of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart</em> and&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em>, it’s “undeniably charming.” Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/11/review-kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2.html"><em>Digitally Downloaded</em></a>‘s Matt S. said the racer is “fun” but “not any more than that.” Labeling the game “filler,” but conceding it’s “a fun distraction and the kind of thing you’ll pick up every six months or so for a quick blast and laugh.”</p> <p>Here’s a selection of what other sites that Nintendo likes better than us are saying about&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders</em>.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-air-riders-review-ter-rick-fic/1900-6418443/"><em>GameSpot</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is an impressive package that makes the most of its deceivingly simple mechanics. Air Ride delivers a solid kart racing experience; Top Ride is a fun–albeit a bit straightforward–distraction; City Trial is chaotic in the best way possible; and Road Trip ties it all together with its creative encounters and satisfying progression. In the second <em>Kirby Air Riders Direct</em>, Masahiro Sakurai said he had no plans to continue the franchise or add any DLC. When I first heard this, I was a little disappointed, but now that I’ve spent countless hours exploring each mode, there’s not really anything else I could want. This feels like that initial concept from 2003 taken as far as it could possibly go, and I couldn’t be happier with the result.” — Jake Dekker</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I’m not sure what’s crazier: the fact that <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> exists, or the fact that it’s this great. It’s a blast in local or online multiplayer during its traditional races and unique battle mode, and its frankly absurd amount of fun achievements to chase, meaningful unlockables, and deep customization makes it great for solo players, too.” — Logan Plant</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“As someone who had a reasonable enough time with the original <em>Kirby Air Rider</em> [sic] on the GameCube, I’d be lying if I said it was top of my list of classic Nintendo games that I wanted to see making a comeback (Punch-Out, Excite Truck and Kid Icarus, please if you’re reading this, Furukawa-san). But Kirby Air Riders is a pleasant surprise that may have some rather eccentric design choices at times – especially in its anticlimactic City Trial mode – but is a great little racing game with engaging and replay-friendly solo modes.” — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-i-love-kirby-air-riders-more-than-mario-kart-world/"><em>Siliconera</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“I knew I’d like&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders,&nbsp;</em>since I enjoyed the GameCube original, but I didn’t expect this game to feel stronger than&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. It’s so enjoyable and robust. There’s room for both racers on the Switch 2, of course. But if I had to pick a favorite and never touch the other game again, I’d pick&nbsp;<em>Kirby Air Riders&nbsp;</em>every time. There’s so much to do, and every mode feels well-realized and valuable.” — Jenni Lada</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/kirby-air-riders-review/"><em>TheGamer</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Game director&nbsp;Masahiro Sakurai’s charm and endless attention to detail is felt throughout <em>Air Riders</em>, but City Trial has it flooding out of every pore. At first, it feels like pure chaos and arguably a bit pointless, but as you figure out stats, Machines, and embrace every random event instead of playing it safe, City Trial becomes the standout mode of <em>Air Riders</em>. Even with just one map and some events feeling too luck-based, it simply never gets boring.” — George Foster</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/19/kirby-air-riders-review-nintendos-pink-puffball-rides-24741030/"><em>Metroid Game Central</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>“Kirby Air Ride was a fundamentally flawed concept 22 years ago and it has not aged well. Especially as the three main modes are all more or less exactly as they were over two decades ago, to the point where this is really more of a remake than a sequel… If, however, you want to play an irritating, formless, racer that’s simultaneously overcomplicated and far too simple then <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the game for you.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Pokémon collectors around the world may have just started their recovery following the release of Phantasmal Flames, but there is no time to rest as the next TCG set is on the horizon—and it’s going to be a master set nightmare.</p>



<p>Mega Dream ex releases in Japan on November 28, with the English version of the set, Ascended Heroes, due to release at the back-end of January 2026, and it’s going to be problematic for those who want to catch ’em all.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dream-ex-is-a-master-set-nightmare">Mega Dream ex is a Master Set Nightmare</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Variety of types. Images via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ahead of the Japanese release, teasers for Mega Dream ex have started to emerge on social media, showcasing eye-catching cards that are going to jump straight to the summit of collectors’ want-lists, including a stunning Psyduck Art Rare.</p>



<p>Other details of the set, reported by the likes of <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/11/mega-dream-ex-special-set-officially-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, have revealed several types of reverse holo cards will be in packs, with reveals showing various Pokéball designs and reverse holos reflecting a Pokémon’s type.</p>



<p>Additionally, Team Rocket’s Pokémon return in the set and will have an exclusive type of reverse holo featuring the Team Rocket logo, which puts the total of different types of reverse holo in the set to three—and that’s before the inevitable Master Ball holo is also revealed.</p>



<p>The finer details of the reverse holos are yet to be detailed, specifically how many types each card in the set will have, and it remains to be seen whether the English version of the set follows suit.</p>







<p>A precedent has been set with the release of Black Bolt and White Flare earlier this year, however, which introduced Pokéball and Master Ball reverse holos for the first time in the language.</p>



<p>Given how difficult it has become to get hands on Pokémon TCG products, the potential of various types of reverse holos to collect may give collectors a headache.</p>

                <p>This was the Kirby Air Ride match where legends were born. Two players faced off on the streets of City Trial, each maneuvering Kirby with precision. One player had assembled what seemed to be an unstoppable, legendary machine--a combination of three difficult-to-collect pieces that granted a huge advantage. The other player gambled, taking a risky move in striking the machine and destroying it before the match ended. Against all odds, the underdog seized the win. It was a comeback rarely seen in the tight knit Kirby Air Ride community that's been riding Warp Stars for more than five years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70tL_46qwDU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/70tL_46qwDU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This wasn’t just a match--it was a demonstration of the skill, strategy, and intuition that fuels the Kirby Air Ride community. Now, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/kirby-air-riders-everything-to-know/2300-6466521/" data-ref-id="2300-6466521">Kirby Air Riders</a> on the horizon, that community is buzzing louder than ever. The promise of a new official release has fans analyzing trailers and previews, debating which abilities will dominate, and counting down the days until they can prove themselves within the City Trial.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was no easy way to play Kirby Air Ride competitively before 2017. Kirby Air Ride wasn't seen as viable," Kirby Air Ride caster Betokirby tells GameSpot. "Then you see UnclePunch working with others to make the HackPack. The HackPack is where competitive Kirby Air Ride started."</p><p dir="ltr">The roots of competitive Kirby Air Ride can be traced back to a Super Smash Bros. modder known online as <a href="https://x.com/UnclePunch_" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UnclePunch</a>. In 2017, he began collaborating with others to create the HackPack, a mod that would fundamentally reshape the way players approached the game. The HackPack added a simple change: a dedicated B button for breaking. Suddenly, players had greater control over their movement and speed, opening the door to more precise, skill-based gameplay.</p><p>"Kirby Air Ride needed the love it deserved," UnclePunch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KirbyAirRide/comments/7gl09f/kirby_air_ride_hack_pack_v10_released/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2017 when he released the 1.0 version of the HackPack.</p><p dir="ltr">Uncle Punch didn’t stop there. Abilities and attacks were modded to be separated to two buttons, letting playing actually aim before they shot. It added a layer of tension and strategy that elevated casual matches into something more competitive and technical.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HackPack in place, organized, bracketed tournaments that drew attention from the fanbase began to pop up in a <a href="https://discord.gg/SmZFfnDc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a>. Fifty or so entrants would gather for these competitions, meticulously practicing techniques in order to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Each match became a chess game at high speed, with players anticipating each other’s moves while managing the chaos of abilities, obstacles, and speed boosts. Online tournaments alike grew in popularity, proving that Kirby Air Ride was more than just a nostalgic curiosity--it was a game that demanded skill and strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came the announcement that no one saw coming. Kirby Air Riders was revealed during a Nintendo Direct, and the response was instantaneous and overwhelming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="154155524" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"I had never seen that many in that small corner of the internet. It was like Jesus had returned. Kirby Air Ride only had a cult following up until that point. When I say cult following, if Sakurai came out and said we had to jump off a bridge, there would be 5,000 people lining up.”</p><p dir="ltr">For years, the community had been quietly passionate, but this announcement turned that simmering dedication into an inferno.</p><p dir="ltr">The impact was immediate. Interest in the competitive Kirby Air Ride scene grew overnight. New players joined Discord servers, longtime veterans dusted off their setups, and tournament entries more than doubled. For a community that had survived on nostalgia, modding, and word-of-mouth tournaments, this was the validation they had been waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans look forward to Kirby Air Riders, the legacy of the HackPack, UnclePunch, and the competitive community is clear. The game’s technical and chaotic core remains unchanged, but now, with a new official platform, the stakes are higher and the audience larger. And for those who have been racing in basements and modding their way to perfection, it feels like a dream realized--a chance to take their skills from underground battles to center stage.</p><p dir="ltr">With Kirby Air Riders downloaded onto their consoles, organizers hope the community will reach new highs.</p>

                <p>Usually, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1990819375410983115" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for free only through the Priority app</a>, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1125" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903"></a><figcaption>O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg"></figure><p>Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get.</p><p>We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrilldiver</a>--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.</p><p>Fans of freebies who feel like they're missing out can take solace in the fact that the winter holiday season is about to start, and Epic usually gives out multiple free skins this time of year. In the final six weeks of 2024, for example, Fortnite offered free Juice WRLD and Snoop Dogg skins, as well as the Fortnite-original Yulejacket, plus accessories for all of them.</p>

            <p>F1 25 will receive a paid expansion to cover next year's F1 season, EA has said, instead of receiving a new standalone game as expected.</p>
<p>As with many EA Sports games, the F1 series has received a new game each year to represent the sport's new season, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/codemasters-and-new-owner-ea-announce-f1-2021">EA acquired Codemasters in 2021</a>. But that won't be the case next year.</p>
<p>This decision is "part of a strategic reset for the F1 Franchise," said Lee Mather, senior creative director at Codemasters, in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/th/games/f1/f1-25/news/f1-franchise-announcement">statement</a>. And while the developer is skipping a new game for 2026, in 2027 it will release a new game "that looks, feels, and plays differently, delivering more gameplay choices".</p>

<p>Mather further emphasised the developer's commitment to the F1 series.</p>
<p>"F1 25 has been an incredible success, fueled by the passion of fans and the energy of the sport," said Mather. "With Formula 1's momentum on and off the track, now is the perfect time for us to look ahead and build for the future.</p>
<p>"We're fully committed to the EA Sports F1 franchise. Our multi-year plan extends this year's excitement with the 2026 expansion and reimagines the F1 experience for 2027 to deliver even more for players at every level around the world."</p>
<p>It does feel like a somewhat ironic decision, considering F1's 2026 season is bringing new regulations to shake up the sport. Hopefully these will be reflected authentically in the expansion, before 2027's brand new standalone game.</p>
<p>Though not mentioned by Mathew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-it-is-reducing-roles-at-codemasters-and-redeploying-as-many-as-possible">EA confirmed earlier this year it had reduced some roles at Codemasters</a> and ended its partnership with the World Rally Championship.</p>
<p>"As a business, we are constantly evolving to meet the growing needs of our players and driving greater focus across our portfolio," the company said in a statement. "This has led us to look at reducing some roles, while we redeploy as many as possible against our strategic priorities."</p>
<p>It's unclear if these layoffs have also impacted development on the F1 games.</p>
<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA announced it would be privately acquired in a $55bn deal</a> by a group of investors, including Saudi Arabia's investment fund.</p>

<figure data-uuid="736db5a4aa48d"><a title="ARC Raiders / Roblox" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/736db5a4aa48d/arc-raiders-roblox.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Genvid CEO Jacob Navok, the former Director of Business at Square Enix, has shared his two cents' worth on the ongoing debate surrounding the use of AI in game development. While it's far from a glowing endorsement of the practice, Navok argues that most players "generally do not care" about it (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/most-gamers-arent-actually-bothered-by-gen-ai-in-games-says-former-square-enix-exec-many-studios-i-know-are-relying-on-it-and-art-or-voices-like-arc-raiders-are-the-tip-of-the-spear/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>"For all the anti-AI sentiment we're seeing in various articles," Navok wrote in a recent post on <a href="https://x.com/JNavok/status/1990136368757186996">X</a>, "it appears consumers generally do not care".</p>
<p>Alongside the successful launch of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/arc_raiders">ARC Raiders</a>, the source of Navok's argument is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_a_Brainrot">Steal a Brainrot</a>, the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/roblox">Roblox</a> game that racked up 30 million concurrent users ("approximately 80x the ARC Raiders concurrents") earlier this year despite being, quote, "named after/based on AI slop characters". The game tasks players with 'stealing' voxel characters modelled on the AI-generated creature meme, 'Italian Brainrot', and, if those numbers weren't telling enough, has proven immensely popular.</p>
<p>"Gen Z loves AI slop, does not care," wrote Navok. "The upcoming generation of gamers are Bane in <strong>Dark Knight Rises</strong>, saying 'You merely adopted the slop, I was born in it'".</p>
<p>This follows a handful of high-profile cases of AI-generated images appearing in the year's biggest releases, with both <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/embarrassing-ai-art-plagues-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-launch">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and ARC Raiders being dragged through the mud at launch, while <em>still</em> putting up huge sales numbers, regardless.</p>
<p>And yet, art and voice work are just "the tip of the spear" when it comes to AI being used in the industry, Navok continues. "Many studios I know are using AI generation in the concept phase, and many more are using Claude for code".</p>
<p>"It will be hard to find a non-indie title that isn't using Claude for code," he concluded, "and ignoring Claude's AI use because it's code while focusing purely on art shows that a lot of AI sentiment is being driven by emotion rather than logic".</p>

<p>Of course, high player counts for the Roblox slop game or ARC Raiders aren't to suggest that everyone is on board with AI implementation. While some studios like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/ea-is-diving-headfirst-into-generative-ai-with-new-partnership">EA are diving headfirst into it</a>, we've seen great swathes of studios (big and small) standing opposed to the idea, and our social feeds are constantly awash with disappointed fans after the discovery that their favourite series/franchises/games have hopped on the AI trend.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/consumers-generally-don%E2%80%99t-care-about-ai-in-video-games-former-square-enix-executive-says.1357792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite the use of AI in video games and creative work being one of the hottest debated ethical topics among enthusiasts, consumers generally remain indifferent, according to a former Square Enix executive.</p>



<p>Jacob Navok, Genvid CEO and former Director of Business at Square Enix Holdings, <a href="https://x.com/JNavok">recently chimed in on the debate via X</a>, providing compelling evidence for why this consumer indifference is driving industry change.</p>



<p>Navok cited the success of the Roblox title Steal a Brainrot as a prime example. The game, which features 3D models based on AI slop characters, has been a massive hit among Gen Z gamers, reaching a peak of approximately 30 million concurrent players. This massive popularity signals that the current generation of young gamers doesn't care about the matter, and future generations of gamers will care even less. As Navok put it, quoting <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Dark Knight Rises</em>: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"You merely adopted the slop, I was born in it."</em></p>



<p>With the general consumer base largely uninterested in the matter, AI usage in video games is expected to increase significantly. The former Square Enix executive noted that many studios are already using AI generation in the concept phase, and many others are using tools like Claude for code, suggesting it will soon be hard to find an indie studio that isn't leveraging these tools.</p>

(All… <a href="https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK">https://t.co/B3mexTjBcK</a></p></div>— Jacob Navok (@JNavok) <a href="https://twitter.com/JNavok/status/1990136368757186996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>While most consumers, especially the younger generation, may not care about AI, how it is used makes all the difference in terms of quality, but perhaps not in terms of sales and revenue.</p>



<p>For instance, Embark Studios utilized AI to enhance the player experience in ARC Raiders by <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">generating additional voice lines while ethically compensating voice actors for their voices to serve as the source material</a>. However, while this represents high-quality integration, it may not outperform the AI slop model in terms of scale. Navok notes that the Roblox game is set to earn significantly more money for longer, making between $80 and $90 million since its release and continuing to be highly popular, hitting a 20 million concurrent players count two weeks in a row this month.</p>



<figure><div>

<p>ARC Riders is the prime example of how AI can be used to enhance the experience of a video game, but other implementations can be just as interesting, and far from falling into the AI slop category that is at the center of the current debate. Everstone Studio's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">Where Winds Meet</a>, for example, features some NPCs powered by AI chatbots, which can lead to a variety of interactions, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ai-chatbot-npcs-are-unironically-the-games-best-feature/">ranging from appropriate to wildly hilarious</a>. Other games, however, lean more into the category reviled by many, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which replaced real art for its calling cards with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">AI-generated images that leave a lot to be desired.</a></p>



<p>Where do you stand in this raging debate? Does AI usage put you off, or are you okay with it as long as the game is fun? Let us know in the comments.</p>

              <p>Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait for the main event to start saving. Plenty of early deals are live across a wide range of categories at almost all big retailers, which also makes it a great time to grab some premium laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/">We just spotted the 15-inch Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 going for $650 on Amazon, after 35% off its retail price of $999</a>. It’s a powerful and reliable option for both everyday work and play, but the offer is only around for a short time. Act fast before the price shoots back up. There’s no telling if the discount will be back for the main sale event, or if the stock will last till then.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Display for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a slim laptop, but the build quality is seriously impressive. The military-grade, durable build protects it from everyday wear and tear well, while also keeping it lightweight enough to carry around with you on the go. Open it up and you’re greeted with a nice 15.3-inch WUXGA display that’s both bright and spacious. Visuals stay clean and sharp for all your content, plus the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. You can use the screen comfortably in both bright and dim settings.</p>
<p>The full-size numeric keyboard makes typing long documents a breeze. It’s not backlit, but since the screen is quite bright, you won’t really have a problem using it after the shadows fall. The machine’s also got a high-quality 720p HD camera paired with an integrated digital microphone for crisp video calls. You will look your best and be heard properly, too.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, the laptop runs on an efficient <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor</strong> that can handle all your everyday tasks like a pro. The <strong>24GB DDR5 SDRAM</strong> lets you multitask without slowing down, and the <strong>built-in 1TB SSD</strong> makes it easy to store all your work documents, media content, programs, and even games at a single place.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, plus a whole bunch of ports, including two USB-A (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), one USB-C (USB 5Gbps / USB 3.2 Gen 1), with USB PD 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.2, one HDMI 1.4, one Headphone/microphone combo jack (3.5mm), one SD card reader, and one Power connector. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to use right out of the box.</p>

              <p>I find the Entertainment Software Association’s (ESA) surveys weirdly depressing. Not because of their contents—they are in fact usually incredibly spiriting and positive—but because of how they are wholly ignored by the worldwide media in favor of reporting on video games as either a peculiar niche or a lethal scourge. Facts like how the average age of a games player is 41, demographics split almost 50:50 men and women, and 80 percent of people play games socially, go routinely ignored. The latest data you won’t be seeing recalled on your favorite morning news show is that a significant majority of children wish their parents would play video games <em>with</em> them. Oh, and also that they give them money to spend <em>in</em> them.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theesa.com/what-do-kids-want-for-holiday-gifts-video-games-of-course-they-also-want-their-parents-to-game-alongside-them/">This ESA latest holiday survey</a>, conducted with YouGov, spoke to 1,912 people aged 5 to 65, to find out what kids want to find under their tree this year. And, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-esa-report-digital-currency-vbucks-christmas-1851049230">like in 2023</a>, it found that most kids want video games and video game-related currency. 58 percent of children are putting games on their wish list, meaning games are the third most popular desire after money and gift cards (69 percent) and clothing or accessories (63 percent). And as we’ve seen previously, it’s primarily not a new physical game that kids are after, but rather in-game currency.</p>

 <p>43 percent will be asking for money to spend in a game they already own (be it Vbux, Robux, G-tag Shinies, etc), compared to 39 percent who are after a new console, and just 37 percent looking for a new physical game. 32 percent, meanwhile, are looking for an in-game subscription.</p>

 <p>The boy/girl split has become far more stark in 2025, however. This year 76 percent of boys aged 5 to 17 want something video game-related, while only 39 percent of girls have it on their letter to Santa. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-children-say-they-want-video-games-more-than-anything-else-this-holiday-season/">2023</a> it was 59 percent of girls. In <a href="https://www.theesa.com/video-games-top-kids-wish-lists-this-holiday-season/">2024</a> it was 67 percent. So what on Earth has happened in the last year to see that number plummet? Well, the best explanation I can find is that this year’s survey has expanded its age range to include 5 to 9-year-olds as well, and perhaps younger girls are less interested and so skewing the numbers.</p>

 <p>But what stands out most to me is the data that more than half of children say they want to play more video games with their parents. 58 percent, in fact. Obviously those numbers drop off significantly as kids get older, but among 5 to 7-year-olds, an astonishing 73 percent say they want their parents to play alongside them more. It’s still 66 percent aged 8 to 9, and 62 percent for kids aged 10 to 12. (The ESA doesn’t include 12 to 17 numbers, so we can assume it sharply drops off at that point in order to get the overall figure down to 58 percent.)</p>

 <p>Play games with your kids! They want you to! Not only is it the most effective way of negating harm—being able to help moderate mood, better control screen time, and intervene when online issues arise—but it’s a wonderful way to bond. Sure,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> might not be your number one choice of game to play, but let them bring you in, show you their builds, challenge them to some PvP, suggest going on a diamond hunt, or have a house-building competition. Yes, you may suck at&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, but play in Duos and let them teach you, revive you, and put the blame on you when you lose in third place. Even just using the app to stream what they’re playing in VR to your phone can make that a shared experience, kids delighted to have you discover the otherwise secret worlds.</p> <p>The ESA is obviously a biased source, given it’s a trade association for the industry, the cause of E3, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857">a regressive force against games preservation</a>, but its surveys do tend to be based on solid data. Data I wish the broader media would bother reading.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders%E2%80%99-new-map-has-been-visited-over-25-million-times.1357783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last week, Embark Studios released the North Line update for ARC Raiders, the electrifying new extraction shooter. This update introduced the Stella Montis map, an intense facility carved into a mountainside high above all the other maps.</p>



<p>Despite being a PvP haven and a massive threat that features the new deadly ARC enemy, the Shredder, Stella Montis has been visited ‘over 25 million’ times.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-players-love-stella-montis">ARC Raiders Players Love Stella Montis</h2>



<p>Stella Montis is a stark contrast to the other maps in ARC Raiders, simply because it’s all internal and highly scientific. It’s not representative of the ruined world that sits in the Rust Belt, reflected in the likes of Blue Gate and Buried City. Instead, Stella Montis is a harsh, industrial, clinical environment with tight corridors, multiple levels, and plenty of PvP opportunities.</p>



<p>In a recent graphic published by Embark Studios, it was revealed that the new map has been visited more than 25 million times. It’s a fan favorite where PvP is concerned, so that’s most likely what the majority of those visits were for. There are also some new quests on Stella Montis that need to be completed, as well as stacks of loot <strong>unique </strong>to that map.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elsewhere in the numbers, we learned that a whopping 26,923 Matriarch enemies have been eliminated, and a whopping 2.2 million Raiders (including myself) have been knocked down by the Shredder, the <strong>newest </strong>minor ARC enemy.</p>



<p>It’s small but extremely mighty.</p>



<p>Additionally, 37,218 Raiders managed to down themselves with the Deadline, the new hyper-powerful mine added with the North Line update, and a further 117 downed themselves with… rocks.</p>







<p>That’s right – <strong>rocks</strong>. Embark has no idea how they did that either.</p>



<p>What’s your fondest moment from Stella Montis? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how you’re enjoying the map.</p>

<p>The journey in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is not yet over, with additional content coming in the Mega Dimension DLC, and we’ve got all the release date details you need.</p>



<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing a bunch of returning Pokémon to the game, alongside a new story to uncover and new legends to hunt down, expanding on the hours of content the game already has to offer.</p>



<p>If you can’t wait for the release date of Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Mega Dimension DLC and want to know what time it will be available, we have all the details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A will be released on December 10, bringing a host of new content to the game.</strong></p>



<p>The paid-for DLC, which was initially announced before the game’s launch, and the full release date were announced earlier this month alongside a new trailer.</p>



<p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, a new adventure across a weird zone known as Hyperspace Lumiose beckons, with new Mega Evolution Pokémon to discover, including two Mega Raichu forms, and battles against powerful Pokémon that exceed the level 100 cap for the first time in the franchise’s history.</p>







<p><strong>The official start time for the Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC has not been announced. However, based on past DLCs on Nintendo Switch platforms, we’ve got a fairly solid estimate.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike the main releases of Legends: Z-A, which had a staggered release globally, the Mega Dimension DLC will be released simultaneously worldwide, meaning you won’t be able to take advantage of a New Zealand or Australian Nintendo account to jump in early.</p>



<p>Based on previous DLC releases on Switch consoles, including Scarlet and Violet’s The Teal Mask and The Indigo Disk, we expect the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC to be available from 8 PM PT on December 9. </p>



<p>These times are not confirmed, however, and we’ll update this article accordingly if Pokémon provides an official release time.</p>



<p>The table below shows the expected start time for the Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Mega Dimension DLC Expected Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">8 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">10 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">11 PM – Dec. 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">3 AM – Dec. 10</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM – Dec. 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

              <p>Star Wars is the absolute number one licensed franchise for LEGO and the <strong>Millennium Falcon remains their best-selling model</strong>, year after year. Fans continue to return to Han Solo’s iconic ship because it encapsulates everything they love about the saga. This <em>25th Anniversary</em> edition captures the vessel as it appeared in <em>A New Hope</em> and gives you the chance to own a piece of Star Wars history without breaking the bank: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price to $67, down from its usual $84, and marks an all-time low for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>
Build Your Way Into the Star Wars Universe</h2>
<p>Get ready to embark on a construction journey through one of cinema’s most recognizable spacecraft with this <strong>921-piece set</strong>. The build process reproduces the signature features of the Falcon in LEGO form: from the forward-facing <strong>cockpit that Han and Chewie piloted</strong> through asteroid fields and Imperial blockades, to the circular satellite dish resting atop the hull and quad laser cannons positioned for defense</p>
<p>In this way, the included display stand elevates this model beyond a simple toy into proper home décor. Lego designed it to angle the Falcon in such a way that creates visual interest from any viewing position in your room.<strong> A nameplate identifies the ship</strong>&nbsp;and a special 25th Anniversary brick commemorates a quarter-century of Lego Star Wars collaboration. The stand keeps your completed model stable and secure, while showing it off at an eye-catching tilt.</p>



<p>This Millennium Falcon belongs to LEGO’s Starship Collection, a curated series of mid-scale vehicles from across the Star Wars timeline. The scale hits a sweet spot between the massive Ultimate Collector Series models that demand entire shelves and the smaller sets that lack display presence. <strong>At 9.5 inches long, 7.5 inches wide, and 5 inches high</strong>, this Falcon commands attention without dominating your available space.</p>



<p>The build itself is what LEGO refers to as a mindful creative experience designed for adults. Each bag of pieces corresponds to a specific section of the ship, allowing you to tackle the project in manageable sessions after work or on weekends. The instruction manual will walk you through techniques that interlock bricks in satisfying ways, and to watch the Falcon take shape piece by piece delivers that therapeutic flow state that builders chase.</p>
<p>Being a 25th Anniversary edition, this set celebrates the partnership that started in 1999 between Lego and <em>Lucasfilm</em>, which revolutionized both brands. This special commemorative brick is included for display, making your model part of the limited celebration. Anniversary editions are highly regarded by collectors as a milestone in the timeline of Lego and represent both the enduring popularity of the franchise and a specific moment in collecting history.</p>
<p>At $67 for 921 pieces, you’re paying roughly <strong>seven cents per brick</strong> which is well below the typical ten-cent average for licensed Lego sets. The all-time low price turns an already reasonable set into an exceptional value. Black Friday pricing rarely hits Star Wars sets this hard, so snagging the Falcon now means you’re securing both a satisfying building project and a conversation.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steams-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam%E2%80%99s-highest-peak-player-count-game-of-2025-might-surprise-you.1357756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We can picture it now: You’ve come into this news story all guns blazing, thinking you’ve cracked it. Steam is one of the biggest and most consistent metrics for measuring player numbers, but the platform’s biggest peak game of 2025 shocked us a bit.</p>



<p>What another incredible year for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> proves once again that it’s the king (Queen, in this case) of roguelikes, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a game for the ages, and the list honestly goes on. But everyone is always amped up by a game’s first week of release and what its peak player count is—using it as a barometer for success.</p>



<p>Pretty much every major release of 2025 has happened now, and Steam’s highest-peak game might raise an eyebrow or two.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-has-the-highest-steam-peak-of-any-new-2025-game">Monster Hunter Wilds Has The Highest Steam Peak Of Any New 2025 Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption> Wild(s). Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom takes the crown for a new game with the highest Steam peak in 2025! Monster Hunter Wilds continued its mainstream success spectacularly in 2025. The action game reached an all-time peak of 1,384,608, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>To put this into context, this is the fifth-highest peak in Steam history!</p>



<p>Another incredible fact is that one of the games you’d think might have been the peak game barely managed half of Wilds’ total—Battlefield 6. The return of EA’s shooter has blown everyone away, and we’d argue it’s taken the crown as the shooter of 2025: We can hear angry ARC Raiders fans sharpening tools in the background.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s highest Steam peak is <strong>747,440</strong>, and other big games in 2025 haven’t fared too badly either: Hollow Knight: Silksong hit <strong>587,150</strong>, ARC Raiders stole <strong>481,966</strong> of you at once, and even indie hit Schedule 1 cooked up an impressive <strong>459,075</strong> players.</p>



<p>Nothing even got close to 1 million, but Monster Hunter Wilds shrugged off the challenge in style.

            Back in 2022, Sin began <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-terra-invicta-is-too-much-for-one-article-and-possibly-one-lifetime">her impressions</a> of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> space game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-invicta">Terra Invicta</a> with the comment that "I pity anyone who has to review, or god help them, write a guide for Terra Invicta, because doing it even semi-comprehensively would take longer than I expect to live."
</p><p>Further down the page there are horrifying phrases like "makes Europa Universalis seem limited" and "every planet and moon and asteroid, all orbiting in real time", woven through a fascinating account of a game that is sort of XCOM, but you're organising a whole Earth's worth of competing countries and factions to repel solar system invaders who may not even materialise for dozens of hours. But <em>of course</em> Hooded Horse are publishing it. This was one of their first signings, I believe. Those sickos.</p>

<p>The hour of reckoning is nigh. Developers Pavonis Interactive have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1176470/view/599669316683563056?l=english">just released</a> the last major Terra Invicta update before the 1.0 release, which is still undated. The update adds 50 new Early regions, a starting scenario in 2070 that skips you forward to the maturation of interplanetary travel technologies, various AI and performance improvements, and the ability to mount an expedition to the asteroid Apophis in the year 2029, this being when that 20 million tonne boulder will next pass close to Earth.</p>
<p>The creators of Terra Invicta appear hell-bent on representing the real-life status and likely development of space tech, geopolitics and the motions of celestial bodies. The 1.0 release will add a 2026 scenario "with the world situation updated to the present day". This meticulousness prompts the worry that perhaps there <em>is</em> an alien invasion underway and this game is secretly an interface for the actual global resistance. Are you doing an Ender's Game on us, Pavonis? Because I should not be allowed within three lightyears of any command bunker. I'm the guy who forgets which character he is in fighting games.</p>
<p>Here's a full bulletpoint rundown of the 1.0 update.</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>More than 50 new regions on Earth, along with new nations, breakaways, and formables, along with new mechanics for region annexation and federations. We also updated Earth's boost values for the 2022 scenario to match Earth's actual launch capabilities during that year.</li>
<li>The "2070" scenario, in which interplanetary travel has been achieved and all factions start with some space assets already built. Many nations on Earth are consolidated into regional powers with the intent to create greater balance between their stats and initial capabilities, so there are lots of strategies on Earth and in space to explore.</li>
<li>A "realistic" combat mode in which ships are closer to their actual size and propellant consumption at high acceleration increases dramatically. The older mode is still available and now called "cinematic" combat so you can play how you like!</li>
<li>New hab modules, including solar mirrors to support solar power on surface habs on Mars, asteroids, and Jupiter, spy modules to give bonuses to the oppression priority and detecting enemy councilors on Earth, and climate modules that give bonuses to the environment priority.</li>
<li>A bunch of new events, including "Peace Dividend," where nations without rivals can trade military capability for economic benefits; "Officer's Insight," where a high-ranking ship officer can propose faction-wide improvements, and "Apophis Passage," where the passing of this near-Earth asteroid in 2029 offers the opportunity to mount an expedition for scientific advancements.</li>
<li>Some new projects, including three faction-specific projects for each faction, as well as some that improve Earth-based research. Also consolidated many national independence projects.</li>
<li>An updated tutorial!</li>
<li>UI updates galore, including a new org manager to manage your councilors' orgs all in one place.</li>
<li>Smarter AI on Earth and in space.</li>
<li>Performance improvements, bugfixes, and balance changes across the board. Buffs to particle weapons, hybrid and exotic armor, and earlier access to plasma weapons. Most ship hulls gained a utility slot as batteries became a completely optional module.</li>
<li>10 new achievements! We'll let you discover what they are.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I would like to hear more about the revised tutorial and UI. In her 2022 write-up, Sin noted that it was often hard to know what to do, and not just because "there's just so much STUFF and so little capacity to pursue 95% of it that it largely becomes background noise." Beyond that, I have a terrible urge to play this but haha haahahaa ahaaa, I'm not going to review it. I can't even dry my towels correctly, let alone get my spies in order. Don't try to make me review Terra Invicta, Julian. I will scream.</p>

            <p>It's been tradition for as long as anyone can remember, that the team at RPS ends the year by choosing their favourite 24 games from the preceding 12 months. In December, we reveal our picks day-by-day. We call this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/advent-calendar">the RPS Advent Calendar</a>.</p>
<p>It's also been tradition that our readers, the inveterate gamblers that they are, bet on what games we're going to pick. Crawling through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/reviews">our reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/playing-this-weekend">'What are we all playing this weekend?' posts</a>, and social media ramblings to gain insights to our picks. I swear last night I saw the face of a commenter at my kitchen window, scanning the room for evidence of my choices. Thank goodness, all they saw was evidence of my tightly regimented batchcooking process.</p>
<p>This year will mark the thirteenth year of the RPS Advent Calendar Guessing Game. If it were a child, it could now legally create a social media account and message abuse at the RPS team for including a game in the advent calendar which we didn't review or even write about at any point in the previous 12 months. It's an incredible effort by the event's organiser Aerothorn and a genuine joy to see everyone getting involved.</p>
<p>To take part in the contest, you need to head over to <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockpapershotgun">the RPS Discord server</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/152113064727150594/1434625053642854433">join the #2025-advent-calendar-guessing-game channel</a>. There you will find a thread where you can submit your guesses. The first post in the channel contains the full rules, but I'll liberally copy and paste the key ones below:</p><p>"On December 1st, Horace will emerge from his den and reveal to us one of the greatest PC games of 2025. He will do this for 24 days, on the final day revealing the Bestest Best game of the year. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to predict which twenty-four games will be selected.</p>
<p>"In the Entries thread, post a list of the 24 games that you think will feature on the RPS Advent Calendar. Specify which game is Day 24, aka the Bestest Best Game. This is the first tiebreaker. The order of the rest doesn’t matter."</p>
<p>[The second second tiebreaker question is: “How many of the Advent Calendar picks didn't receive a review on RPS?” We're looking for an officially labeled review - not a news story, supporter post, etc."]</p>
<p>"You get a point for every pick that appears on the calendar. At the end of the competition, the person with the most points wins, the second-most is the runner-up, and the third-most is the runner-up runner-up. In the event of a tie, we’ll use the following tiebreakers:</p>
<p>"The individual who correctly guessed the Bestest Best game is the winner.</p>
<p>"If both/neither leaders guessed the Bestest Best game, the person with the closest guess for the second tiebreaker will win.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is still a tie, we’ll have extra prizes for the winners."</p>
<p>What's that? Prizes?</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<ul>
<li>12 month RPS sub for 1st place</li>
<li>6 month RPS sub for 2nd place</li>
<li>3-month RPS sub for 3rd place</li>
</ul>
<p>Some added details to help you make your picks.</p>
<p>Everyone on the RPS team votes. So this year, that means me, Callum, Edwin, James, Jeremy, Mark, and Ollie. We all privately pick ten games, ordering them from first to last. The game in first place is worth ten points, second place is worth nine, and so on, with tenth place being worth one point. I then add them all to a spreadsheet, add up the totals for each game, and the top 24 games become our advent calendar for that year. (Though, we don't publish them in score order, except for the game revealed on December 24th – that's what we consider to be the Bestest Best game of the year).</p><p>To be eligible for this year's RPS Advent Calendar, a game needs to have been released or received a significant update in the past 12 months. This also means that games which are in early access are in the running. We sometimes pick games from the previous December because we had already closed that year's voting at the point they came out.</p>
<p>This year will be particularly hard to guess as we have seen significant changes in the team. I only joined in October, for instance, and the game I've written most about is Wall World 2 – and not especially positively.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though, all the guessers will be in the same boat, and in previous years, the winner has often done it by getting less than 60% of their guesses right.</p>

It was written and directed by Alberto Mielgo, who created The Witness for Netflix’s Love, Death &amp; Robots, and won an Oscar for The Windshield Wiper in 2022.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>, Mielgo hit out at those who accused the Marathon cinematic of being built using generative AI, insisting it took 155 staff months to put together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” Mielgo said. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months… Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/19/gettyimages-1239569185-1763550693393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Alberto Mielgo wins Best Animated Short for The Windshield Wiper at the 94th Academy Awards in 2022.

And with a lack of legislation forcing generative AI disclaimers onto output, audiences are left to try to work it out themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The issue over what is generative AI and what isn’t has spilled over into the realm of deepfakes, too, with a number of celebrities hitting out at the technology. In July, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/john-wick-star-keanu-reeves-reportedly-pays-a-company-a-few-thousand-dollars-a-month-to-get-tiktok-and-meta-to-take-down-imitators"><u>John Wick star Keanu Reeves pays a company a few thousand dollars a month to get the likes of TikTok and Meta to take down imitators</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marathon - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Mielgo appears to have also addressed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-discuss-marathon-developer-bungies-future-after-yet-another-plagiarism-row-rocks-studio-make-no-mistake-this-is-an-existential-struggle-for-bungie-at-this-point">the Marathon plagiarism controversy that rocked Bungie</a> earlier this year. <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Post</a> reported that Mielgo replied to one Instagram comment to say the incident was overblown, but those comments are now deleted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon has certainly endured a troubled development. After having a September 2025 release date set (the cinematic was released when this release date was still planned), Bungie delayed the game into 2026 to make adjustments based on feedback from playtests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure is indeed on Marathon to succeed amid Destiny 2’s high-profile struggles.

In fact, the improvement from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/14/kirby-air-ride-review">Air Ride</a> on GameCube to Air Riders on Switch 2 is so huge, it feels like jumping straight from Smash 64 to Ultimate with no sequels in between. It has an enormous amount of varied content, meaningful unlockables, in-depth customization, and an unrivaled attention to detail that make it hard to imagine a better realization of this formula. The thing is, that formula simply isn’t as strong as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review">Super Smash Bros.</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart</a>. There’s only so far you can push a control scheme that’s sometimes <em>too </em>simplistic for its own good, and Air Riders occasionally crashes into roadblocks caused by its own self-imposed limitations. But if you meet this surprise revival on its own terms and accept its unconventional handling and off-the-rails physics, you’ll find a fun, frantic action racing game with an almost unreal amount of stuff to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders includes more than 20 machines that each handle pretty differently, and a similar number of playable riders who come with their own stats and Final Smash-like special move. It’s a great roster filled with characters from every era of Kirby history. My main is the hilarious Chef Kawasaki, who serves spicy curry that damages rivals. At first, there are only a few riders and machines available, but you’ll instantly start unlocking more by playing any mode you like. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Machines accelerate automatically, creating a constant feeling of on-rails forward momentum. It’s your job to steer, glide off ramps to fly in the air, drift-boost around sharp turns, and attack enemies and fellow riders. You do all this with the left stick and just one button that hits the brakes while charging your boost. (Air Riders did add a second button compared to the original, but its main use is launching your special attack.) This takes a lot of getting used to. Skidding around corners on a floaty machine doesn’t feel natural at first, and the unique quirks of many vehicles ask even more of you, like the Swerve Star’s limitation of only being able to turn while braking. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I love how strikingly original these mechanics and minimalist controls are, as there’s really nothing else like the two Air Ride games, and mastering each machine’s intricacies is genuinely a ton of fun. Some machines feel a little overpowered – the high-speed Chariots that turn corners with ease will likely be a very popular pick online – but they all still seem viable in some way. The Jet Star, for instance, is slow on the ground but gets huge bursts of speed whenever it lifts off, causing you to make mental bookmarks of the best spots to catch some air. This really feels nothing like Mario Kart – but in that same vein, Mario Kart is far easier for new folks to pick up and play. Air Riders includes in-depth lessons that explain everything in great detail, but if you’re inviting friends over to try it out for the first time, expect a similar amount of onboarding as teaching someone a new board game – unless they're happy careening down the course like it's a bowling lane with bumpers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got used to the controls very quickly – thanks to a surprising amount of legacy skill from playing lots of the first one when I was a kid – and really fell in love with how this sequel has totally fleshed out the promise of the original. This improvement is specifically noticeable in Air Ride, the traditional racing mode that features tense six-player races (the smaller number keeps the chaos somewhat in check) on a fantastic lineup of 18 courses: nine new, and nine returning. A common complaint of the first game (which I share) is that the racing often felt like it was playing itself without much input. While it’s still true that your machine can stumble to the end without you doing anything, there are a lot more things to consider in Air Riders that raise its skill ceiling to a satisfactory level. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are more things to consider while racing that raise the skill ceiling to a satisfactory level.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Opponents in front of you leave behind a trail of stars, and you’ll want to stick to their racing line as closely as possible to increase your top speed. It’s very important to defeat enemies by inhaling them, using copy ability attacks, or rapidly spinning your machine as well, because every kill grants a small speed boost and charges your special meter. You’ll want to keep the little things in mind too, like landing perfectly parallel to the ground to gain a speed boost on each jump. Some of these mechanics were in the first Air Ride, but they’ve been buffed here, and with an increased speed overall, I felt really locked in while keeping track of the fast-paced action and rhythmically hitting A at the right moments to attack and boost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all made even better by some incredible track design. Each new course feels like a rollercoaster ride, with awesome visual effects, high-energy music, and tons of branching paths that play into different machine’s strengths, like a roadway up high that can only be reached by a machine with great gliding capabilities. My favorite course is Mount Amberfalls, a downhill sprint filled with switchback turns through a gorgeous forest bright with fall colors, but there’s really not a weak entry in the lineup. The returning courses are a lot simpler, but it’s still fun that they’re here for longtime fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, Top Ride takes the action to a bird’s eye view, with top-down, bite-sized races on miniature courses inspired by the main tracks. This simple mode wears very thin very fast, and honestly only feels like it’s here out of obligation to the original. To be fair, it is more fleshed out than it used to be as you can bring in any machine you want, but it still plays like a watered-down, zoomed out version of the standard races that I’d rather be doing instead. It’s not bad, and if you enjoyed it in the original you’ll probably like it even more here, but it’s the weakest part of Air Riders, and only really works as a quick distraction from the more enticing modes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last main feature is City Trial, the fan-favorite battle mode where up to 16 riders drop into an open city map and work for five minutes to build the strongest machines they can. Once time is up, everyone competes to win a minigame with that custom machine. If you played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/super-smash-bros-for-nintendo-3ds-review">Super Smash Bros. for 3DS</a>, it’s just like Smash Run, which was heavily inspired by Air Ride’s City Trial. (Time is a flat circle.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 20 years later, City Trial is still the highlight of this package. Riding around the new map called Skyah, hunting for stat boosts and a better machine, attacking any rivals you come across, and dealing with the random events that take place is a blast, and it’s so easy to play <em>just one more round </em>with friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It keeps things fresh by spicing up each run with dozens of potential field events, from surprise boss encounters with longtime Kirby enemies like Kracko and Dyna Blade, to energy tanks running at full blast for a limited time, to a thick blanket of fog covering the whole city. There are slight variations to Skyah’s geography, too: its forest area rotates between seasons, warp gates appear at different spots, and if you’re lucky, far-off islands littered with powerups will appear, giving you a huge advantage <em>if </em>you can build a glider good enough to reach them. Just like the courses, intimately learning every corner of the city is rewarding, and you’ll start to figure out your favorite things to do, like diving into the volcano to collect all the goodies that have spawned inside, or gathering three parts to assemble an overpowered legendary machine, which happens so rarely that it feels special every time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sometimes City Trial is <em>too </em>hectic to the point where it borders on overwhelming.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes City Trial gets <em>too </em>hectic, though, to the point where it borders on overwhelming. It's not uncommon to feel like you’re completely out of control if you gather too many powerups. You might think that means you should be careful to not pick up everything in sight, but given the slippery turning and constant acceleration, it’s not really realistic to pick and choose what you pick up and what you don’t beyond a certain extent. Because of that, the machine you end up with often ends up being more about what happened to you rather than what you chose to build. That’s still entertaining, but don’t expect City Trial to be some highly competitive, skill-based mode. There’s definitely skill and strategy involved – like deciding if you’re going to attack a boss directly or attack other riders who are fighting the boss to steal their stat boosts – but it’s more about being a frantic, fun party mode first and foremost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This ideology extends to the Stadiums that wrap up each City Trial, as the way the final challenge is selected is very strange. When playing online with 16 riders, everyone is given four choices for which minigame event to compete in based on the strengths and weaknesses of their personal machines. Do you have a really high top speed? You’ll want to pick Drag Race. Does your machine rip opponents to shreds? Pick Kirby Melee or Dustup Derby for a combat-focused challenge. I loved the Winged Star machine in 2003 and I love it now, so I’ll always hop on it when I see it, and I usually end up in a glider-based challenge like Target Flight or Air Glider as a result. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s nice that you’re given a choice online so you’re not at risk of ending up in an event you have literally no shot at winning. Bikes, for example, can’t glide at all. But thics also means there’s a high chance you don’t end up in the same Stadium as your friends when everyone splits off into their own challenge, meaning you just competed for five minutes only to battle CPUs or strangers. When playing locally, it’s the opposite problem, as you’ll all vote between four choices, and everyone ends up in the same one selected by a roulette, which means you <em>will </em>end up in a Stadium you have no shot in from time to time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a workaround by selecting the Random option before the match and then turning off all but one event in the Random Stadium Select options, and you'll occasionally see hints to clue you in on which Stadium might be coming. But for a game so customizable in many other ways, I wish there was an easier, dedicated way to select a specific Stadium at the start of City Trial and announce it to all players so everyone knows what type of machine they should go for. As it stands, It’s a choice that, again, feels like it’s sticking a little too closely to the original’s blueprint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s still so much fun in a group despite all that. Destroying your friend’s machine and laughing as they embarrassingly scramble on foot to find another ride before time runs out never gets old, and it’s just a great hangout game. Plus, Air Riders has great technical performance amidst all that chaos, running at a solid 60 fps in single-player, and maintaining that target even with four players on screen at once, with only a few occasional hiccups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Air Riders even boasts an impressive suite of online options, including nifty 32-player lobbies, casual and ranked matchmaking, and an actually competent invite system for friends, none of which is a guarantee in a Nintendo game. Online play was very smooth during my test sessions ahead of launch, and I plan to play plenty more once the full game is out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you just want to play alone, Air Riders has so much to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you just want to play alone, Air Riders still has so much to offer. There are 750 achievements divided across checklists dedicated to each mode, and completing them earns you meaningful unlockables like characters, machines, tracks, music, alternate colors, hats, and other cosmetics. You’re constantly unlocking achievements you didn’t know existed, and it’s really satisfying to enter a race with a few specific side objectives in mind, like remembering you need to kill a Scarfy without angering it while also focusing on winning the race. These goals add so much replayability that recontextualize all of Air Riders’ content in clever ways, and after more than 25 hours, I still have over one hundred left to unlock. Even better, you can attempt an achievement straight from the checklist board, setting up all the necessary requirements for you with the press of a button, which is a really smart evolution of this concept. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything you do earns you money, which you can spend on additional paint options, stickers, and accessories to fully customize your machines and take them for a spin in any mode. It’s surprisingly in-depth, and I loved designing personalized versions of my favorite vehicles, and spending in-game gold (no real money microtransactions here) on other players’ creations in the online market, like an incredible Wagon Star modeled after a GameCube, complete with the iconic black handle and four controller ports.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every Masahiro Sakurai Game</h3><p>Ahead of Kirby Air Riders, here's my ranking of every game directed or designed by Mr. Sakurai himself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s Road Trip, Air Riders’ single-player campaign that features a surprisingly epic story. Similar to Smash Ultimate’s World of Light or Classic Mode, Road Trip repackages all of Air Riders’ modes into bite-sized challenges as you work to level up your machine. It only takes about 90 minutes for one run as you ride through hub worlds, select challenges based on their rewards, and run into other references from Kirby history. It’s a fun distraction and a great way to unlock more stuff, but I prefer the main modes to this remix. Especially when so many of Road Trip’s challenges focus on one-on-one combat where you need to destroy a specific rival to win, which is easily this control scheme’s biggest weakness. It’s just not precise enough to support it. Combat works in the context of City Trial’s group battles where your attacks are sure to hit <em>someone</em>, but when you’re given a specific machine to attack <em>while </em>frantically<em> </em>racing around a course, it’s frustrating, and a key example of Air Riders stretching this control scheme past its limitations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, there are so many little details that elevate the whole package. Sakurai’s distinct flair is fully intact here: a character select screen with an announcer who shouts the name of your machine and rider; deeply customizable rulesets that let you play almost however you want; a music player where you can set how often you’d like each track to play during certain modes, and plenty more. Air Riders is undeniably well-made, with a high baseline of quality that’s always present.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-kirby-air-riders-switch-2-incredibly-chaotic-but-satisfyingly-deep-rewarding-racing.1357714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, I think it's fair to say, didn't receive all that warm a welcome when it launched back in 2003.</p>
<p>With lucky GameCubers already marinating in the delicious driving juices of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Kirby's cute and chaotic style of racing just didn't seem to stick with the mainstream, and, as a result, it's become known as one of those Marmite efforts. You either gelled with its new approach to slinging yourself around tracks or you didn't.</p>
<p>For me personally, I've always enjoyed Air Ride's novel take on track racing. I also think it's a game that sings especially strongly in multiplayer, once everyone who's racing fully knows what they're doing. Indeed, this was the first GameCube title that allowed for LAN setups via broadband adapters, so the multiplayer was 100% where the gravy was at.</p>

<p>Taking everything into account, though, and despite my love for the OG, a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> was an unexpected announcement during the run-up to Switch 2. I certainly didn't have it on my Switch 2 bingo card. So it's lucky, then, given that it's a bit of curveball, that it's actually very good.</p>
<p>If I had to guess the two main issues people had with Kirby Air Ride back in the day, it's a fairly even split between a lack of meaningful single-player content and how messy the game can seem to the uninitiated as races (and minigames) play out. Nintendo has obviously taken note of the first issue here, and as a result, we've got a sprawling story mode with multiple paths and endings and a metric ton of collectible content to keep you busy. It's also got a very gritty and serious sci-fi tone, which is so at odds with the style of the actual racing that you can't help but love it.</p>
<p>However, on the second problem, well, you'll have to suck eggs and learn to play the game, I'm afraid. It all makes sense when you get into the sweet Air Ridin' groove. It also wasn't broken in the first place, so bravo to Masahiro Sakurai for sticking to his guns and keeping the soul of it all intact.</p>

<p>On that note: Air Riding. It's not karting. This style of racing is a different beast entirely, and there's a learning curve in getting a hang of the basics. In Air Riders, you take control of a rider from an ever-growing roster of Kirby and his pals, each of whom has an impressive variety of stats relating to their driving abilities, along with their own specials and tricks to pull off mid-race. Stuff like turbo boosts, area of effect attacks, and lots of other stuff I won't spoil the fun of unlocking.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen Waddle De— I mean...whoever your favourite is, you then pick a machine. These aren't just different for the sake of being different, nor do they simply have varying degrees of speed, boost, handling, and so on. No, in Air Riders, there's <em>depth</em>. Proper depth. And it comes in the form of an impressive menagerie of unique machines that work in fundamentally different ways.</p>
<p>We've all seen the default Warp Star that gives you a nice balance of ground and air speed, but then you've got other options like the incredibly fast but terribly fragile Paper Star, the charging Tank Star, the slippery Slick Star, and even a few that transform or straight-up blink like electricity from point to point on a track as they slow then boost.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to take in than you may expect at first blush, and especially if you've listened to naysayers over the years who say it's shallow. Get a few seasoned riders into a race and things can get hugely intense.</p>
<p>With rider and machine chosen and on the track, you then get down to slinging yourself around. Movement forwards is automatic, the number one mental hurdle for newcomers. Your job as pilot is to make sure you utilise every opportunity on the track as it presents itself; to gain maximum forward momentum, by spinning, shifting around the course to hit boosts and jumps, and hammering enemies for mini-boosts or copy abilities to whale on your opponents with.</p>
<p>Once you 'get' it, it's incredibly moreish, and almost zen-like in the focus that's required to take down another rider who knows what they are doing. Feels too automated? You're not trying hard enough.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160638/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also at the core of the racing, beyond the automatic nature of travelling forward, you have the all-important boost/brake button. Holding down 'B' will slow your machine right down until it eventually stops. It also, at the same time, charges up your turbo boost. So there's a strategy at the heart of everything here, and it's a pleasing one in how it relates to some very nicely designed tracks.</p>
<p>You want to know these tracks well to target the best jumps, to know the best opportunities to slow right down for a full boost (tight corners are the most obvious example) or overtake, and to find these opportunities on any given course, whilst also battling a constant stream of other riders and NPC enemies, makes for an addictive and satisfying thing to settle into. It's manic in all the right ways.</p>
<p>This sequel, too, is made all the more satisfying by some visually spectacular race sequences spliced throughout tracks. There's a mix of sections composed of proper, tight-corner racing alongside flashy on-rails sequences where you whip between rails to collect/dodge and set yourself up to boost into whatever comes next.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160639/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo has gone to town on these rail sequences, with some elaborately cool parts where riders tumble and spin through all sorts of wild scenarios, and the game does well to give you just enough control at all times, and enough ways to steal a lead or damage your opponents, that even when you're not fully in control of your machine, and even when weapons are auto-fire on proximity for a lot of the time, it still feels like you're needing to think quickly and know the rules, tracks and machines inside out to make an impact, especially in the online mode.</p>
<p>The story mode is the real big addition, and it makes a good impression. I won't ruin the narrative (and it's not much to write home about), but the setup, where you race through 11 chapters composed of levels full of races and minigames, works well.</p>
<p>Between each race and challenge, you're returned to your vehicle as it blasts along a road through each stage, and this gives you three options at all times on how to proceed, so there's variety along the way, until you hit a mini-boss or boss race battle. It also gives solo players lots to unlock, there's replayability in returning for alternate endings, and it acts as a fantastic training mode for the delights of online.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160642/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I touch on the online, though, you've also got the returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down racing modes. These generally remain largely unchanged from what was offered up in the original game. City Trial gives you five minutes to gather as many collectibles as you can whilst blasting other racers before being dropped into a minigame for a grand finale, and it's as chaotically frenzied as ever. Top Down mode is honestly addictive as all hell when you get into it (think Codemasters' <strong>Grand Prix Sim</strong> on the Commodore 64 but with crazy courses and you're 90% of the way there).</p>
<p>It's the online, though, that's the real king. I had limited time with it for this review, but I luckily found matches in Air Ride and City Trial modes against a few ferocious competitors and I couldn't be happier with the performance. No input lag, no issues connecting, and in races it was buttery smooth, as it is across all modes.</p>
<p>The City Trial and Air Ride races really do come alive here, and I implore you to dig in, learn how to drive the machine of your choice well and reap the benefits of some surprisingly fierce competition - alongside all the jumping into targets, gliding competitions, and events where you try to eat more than everyone else. I mean, Kirby gonna Kirby.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160645/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a solo game, Kirby Air Riders is a step up, then. Each of its modes brings over 100 collectible bits and bobs to unlock and create a picture scene from the story, so there's plenty to work towards. The campaign itself also does a suitably Kirby-esque job in starting out relatively normal on the narrative front before ending up in some far-out sci-fi states. The whole thing also looks and plays as good as anything I've played on Switch 2 thus far, so you're in for a treat on that front, my friends.</p>
<p>I've also got to make a special point here to mention the surprisingly deep machine customisation on offer. I was actually a little shocked! There are loads of textures, icons, unlockable pixel art, and all manner of ways to truly make all of your machines your own. It's a lot, and it's very, very welcome for solo fans.</p>
<p>Onto niggles, and I will say that the chaos — all of the huge icons and speeding around amidst groups of riders, especially in City Trials — can feel aimless at times. And it's still every bit the Marmite experience. The story is silly, and most of the side games, which see you hit air targets, make long jumps, and so on, well, they're not exactly <em>riveting</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160640/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And in local multiplayer, whilst playing on the same system, we spotted that you lose the ability to see the stats for your chosen rider and machines, which sort of takes away the ability to inspect and learn on the fly. Let's hope a little tweak can be patched in on that one.</p>
<p>Overall, then, I know it can be hard to make Kirby converts, but I genuinely believe Kirby Air Riders deserves them. This is a huge big colourful beast of a sequel. It's jam-packed to the rafters with stuff to find, to unlock, and collect, and it has proper depth. There's a ton of machines, loads of riders and courses, and — should you get stuck in and learn and "git gud" — you'll find an alternative to the usual kart-racer style of business that absolutely deserves its place on any podium.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kirby Air Riders is a cracking sequel that gives solo players much more to dig into with its story campaign, whilst also bringing all-new levels of shiny graphics, bells and whistles to its returning City Trial, Air Ride, and Top Down Racing modes. This is a chaotic and frenzied racer, there's no doubt, but it's got depth for those who wish to learn and plenty of competition to be had both online and at harder difficulties for diehards.</p>
<p>With lots of excellent tracks, riders and machines to unlock, sat alongside some surprisingly deep machine customisation, Kirby's latest air riding adventure is off to a strong start. Oh, and that soundtrack!</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What is Kirby Air Riders? That’s the question I’ve found myself wrestling with throughout my time with it in the past couple of weeks. Is it a kart racer? Well… kind of. Is it a vehicular combat game? Sure, you could say that. Is it a multiplayer platform, designed almost completely to be played with others? Yes. Definitely. Yet there’s still a nagging feeling that Kirby Air Riders is one of those games that exists purely for its own reasons. As the first non-Smash Bros game to be directed by Masahiro Sakurai in over a decade, it carries an odd weight of expectation, only adding to the strange and slightly off-kilter vibes you’ll find when you check in for Kirby Air Riders.</p>
<p><iframe title="Get up to speed on Kirby Air Riders in 7 minutes! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzBvMLndm-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Air Ride is the first pillar of Air Riders. This is racing, by way of Kirby and friends’ idiosyncratic flying, floating and grinding. It’s all largely controlled by the left analogue stick and a single button, with boosting and vacuuming up enemies forming your key abilities. Holding the button down starts a boost, with your racer slowing to a crawl before being unleashed when you release the button. Similarly, holding the button while turning initiates a drift, letting you angle your way around the corner, before launching yourself forward at the perfect moment. There is a sense of familiarity to this, part Mario Kart, part Sonic Racing, and as a basis for the game’s mechanics, it’s a good start.</p>


<p>You can then hoover up enemies and abilities from the track. This is your main offence, and there’s a real sense of fun to be had in sucking something up and spitting it at your nearest rival, letting you whizz past them. You can suck up fire, ice, poison or sleep abilities, as well as a host of others, aiming to use them to maximise your advantage. Aiming can be a little tricky at times, mostly because of the speed you and your target are usually moving at, and there’s not quite the surety you have in Mario Kart about how your attacks are going to pan out.</p>


<p>Still, the racing is fast, fun and frenetic, with a decent balance between the chaos of a kart racer and the fairness that you need to keep returning to it time and time again. It feels very different to its main rivals, and that uniqueness is probably its biggest selling point.</p>
<p>The second main mode is Top Ride. This takes the action and turns it into a top-down isometric experience, reminiscent of old-school racers like Super Offroad or its modern brethren Super Woden GP. This, of course, is all very Kirby though, and the small-scale courses look every bit as lovely as you’d expect with candy-coloured scenery and cute incidentals to careen around.</p>

<p>Top Ride is my favourite mode in Kirby Air Riders. It feels incredibly nostalgic, retaining that retro flavour of top-down racers of yesteryear, while boasting dazzling modern visuals. You can choose how many racers take part, though I’d recommend the maximum of eight, which gives you all of the competitive action you could want. Any less than that feels like a sidenote.</p>
<p>Playing in single player presents you with a cavalcade of task and rewards to make your time with Air Riders that bit more individual. There’s a large number of tasks to fulfil on each track – such as landing perfectly three times in one race, or being in the lead for longer than ten seconds – and you’ll unlock decals, machines, and riders as well as a host of other customisation options that let you tailor your vehicles and racer license to your own tastes.</p>
<p>Setting decals and messing with colour schemes and patterns is suitably user-friendly, and I can see people honing in on this mode to come up with some really unique and interesting designs.</p>

<p>City Trial is where things come a bit unstuck. Battle modes can be hit and miss in kart racers, and while City Trial presents some interesting ideas, it pumps the chaos up to 11. The camera also can’t quite keep up with the constantly accelerating action, and I found myself repeatedly dazzled by the hyperactive motion, often blinking sensation back into my eyes.</p>
<p>City Trial unleashes you in an arena where you spend your time whizzing around collecting power-ups, while trying not to lose them to your rivals. Once the timer runs out, you’re shown the number and type of power-ups you’ve acquired before then choosing a Stadium finale. You then take part in a minigame that, ideally, plays to your vehicles’ strengths.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the balance between collecting power-ups and the Stadium finales feels badly paced. I often enjoyed just tootling around, nabbing power-ups while occasionally hitting other players, but it does feel like it goes on for too long, while some of the Stadium events then take all of 30 seconds to complete. It’s not without its charms – unlocking a bunch of new things each time you play definitely helps with that – and there’s the regular events that draw players toward a certain part of the map, but it’s just a bit too drawn out.</p>
<p>Road Trip pulls all of these things together into a journey mode. Along the way, you’ll take part in races, Stadium challenges, or fight bosses in the arena, with a story mode running through that gives you a glimpse into the lore behind Kirby Air Riders, continuing the perpetually perplexing decision to give Kirby a worryingly deep and dark backstory. The cutscenes look fantastic though, and Road Trip does a good job of feeding you events, unlocking rewards and keeping things moving along at a decent lick. I’d recommend playing on Hard, though; otherwise, it’s a little too friction-free.</p>

<p>Kirby Air Riders’ presentation is all very Smash Bros. The chunky menus are clear and easy to understand, and the upbeat soundtrack is head-boppingly cheerful, before it all gives way to chaos. However, just like Smash, in the right hands, Kirby Air Riders becomes more tactical, more skill-based, and the more time you spend with it, the more likely you are to be swept up by its unique charms. It doesn’t have the immediacy of Mario Kart, or the growing collection of recognisable characters from Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, but it’s undeniably charming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Unity surprised everyone this morning during the <a href="https://on.unity.com/Unite2025Live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unite 2025 keynote</a> in Barcelona, Spain, when Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was suddenly called on stage to announce a partnership between the two companies behind the most used third-party game engines in the industry. </p>



<p>Sweeney said he <span>spoke with Matthew Bromberg, president and CEO of Unity (who replaced John Riccitiello after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-steps-down-following-runtime-fee-fiasco/" target="_blank">former CEO's resignation following the runtime fee controversy</a>), about the companies' sh</span>ared objective of supporting open digital platforms. </p>



<p>The first result of this collaboration will be that Unity's brand-new in-app purchase software development kit (SDK) will soon be available to Unreal Engine developers, allowing them to choose this API to handle cross-platform purchases. Sweeney noted that this will become even more important now that Google and Apple are being forced (after Epic's lawsuits) to open up the Android and iOS ecosystems a little.</p>



<p>Arguably, though, the bigger news is that the Fortnite ecosystem, which boasts 500 million registered accounts, is embracing games made in Unity. Sweeney said:</p>



<p><em>Fortnite is a huge game that hit 100 million monthly active users last Holiday. And though it began as a little Battle Royale game that we built, over time, it's evolved into an ecosystem where 40% of playtime is going to third-party content built by independent developers. They're earning hundreds of millions of dollars a year from participating in Fortnite, and now it's going to open up to all Unity games thanks to some really amazing network technology that Unity built that connects other engines into Unity through a networking protocol to make this work. So, starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite's discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines.</em></p>



<p>In somewhat related news, Fortnite recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-island-creators-can-test-selling-items-in-islands-loot-box-style-random-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allowed</a> Island Creators to sell items within their Islands, including random rewards that appear to be functionally similar to lootboxes.</p>

			<p>The ROG Xbox Ally received its biggest update since launch, introducing crucial system improvements, most notably to game performance and power consumption.</p>



<p>The new update, which went live a few hours ago, brings plenty of improvements, including some highly requested community features such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>New CPU P-Core and E-Core settings for the X model</li>



<li>Quick access to the full-screen mode</li>



<li>Adjusted FPS limited option from 45 to 40 FPS to better align with the panel's 120 Hz refresh rate,</li>



<li>Improved power consumption in Modern standby</li>



<li>Improved Game performance with the AMD GPU driver V25.10.27</li>



<li>Improved firmware stability</li>



<li>Overall System Performance Improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The features above are only the highlights of the biggest ROG Xbox Ally update since the system's launch last month. All the details can be found on the <a href="https://rog-forum.asus.com/t5/changelogs/changelog-november-2025-rog-ally-ally-x-xbox-ally-xbox-ally-x/ba-p/1124876">official update notes.</a></p>



<p>As battery life is usually a significant pain point for handheld devices such as the ROG Xbox Ally, power consumption improvements are quite welcome, and make the system an even more enticing purchase for those looking to get into PC handheld gaming, despite some lingering issues preventing it from delivering the same hassle-free gaming experience as consoles.

They’re a suitably skull-adorned outlaw who can dual-wield guns or shivs, while indulging in a cheeky bit of chemical warfare by homebrewing stimulants and lacing their weapons with harmful chems. Basically the opposite of the space-narc Arbites class added this summer, then: they got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">exploding dogs</a>, the Hive Scum gets exploding drugs.</p>

<p>They’re not joining Darktide’s co-op raids until December 2nd, but in the meantime, developers Fatshark have detailed pretty much all their dirty tricks in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTide/comments/1p0hejn/dev_blog_hive_scum_class_design_talents/">Reddit blog</a>. There’s also this teaser trailer, showing off the akimbo shootering and a new crowbar weapon in CGI action.</p> <figure>

<p>According to the dev blog, the Hive Scum looks to complement the existing roster of melee fiends and ranged specialists by performing as a slippery up-close gunslinger – hence being able to double up on quick-firing but less accurate pistols. They’ve also got a choice of unlockable skills geared around sustaining high-risk, close quarters play, with the option to specialise in either shooting or shanking.</p>
<p>Then there’s the <em>controlled substances</em> element. This covers remixes of existing tools, like the Chem Grenade or Chem Toxin: a stackable damage-over-time effect, similar to the existing burning or bleeding modifiers. But it also extends to an entirely new Stimm Lab mechanic wherein Hive Scummers can, by investing skill points (not unlike the main talent tree), create their own injectable Stimms with customised effects. There’s even a Combat Ability in the main tree that lets nearby teammates share the high, an interaction that I desperately hope will trigger anguished, violently guilt-ridden screams of confusion from the Arbites.</p><p>I may have been slightly underwhelmed, watching that trailer for the first time – 40K is ripe with the likes of ancient cyborgs, Hobbit-sized drunken snipers, and half-goat militiamen, none of whom would turn down a scrap with Chaos and all of whom might have made a more interesting addition to the crew than Florida Woman here. I do like the ferocious sound of the Hive Scum playstyle, though, especially after months of maining the methodical Emprah Cop.</p>

<p>Hytale was the once-canceled dream that is now fully back in development. A new, lengthy gameplay trailer has been released, not only showing more of the game, but also saying that early access is on the horizon.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games shut down Hypixel Studios</a> in June 2025, effectively ceasing Hytale’s development. It was showing a lot of promise, but the game—based on the Minecraft&nbsp;multiplayer server&nbsp;Hypixel—suddenly went up in smoke. The dream was revived in November 2025, and to show that the game is back, a new gameplay trailer is out.</p>



<h2 id="h-hytale-is-back-in-development-with-early-access-promised">Hytale Is Back In Development With Early Access Promised</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hytale was heavily inspired by Minecraft. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-back-reacquired-hypixel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was back after being reacquired by Hypixel Studios</a>—rebought by founder Simon “Hypixel” Collins-Laflamme. The new ‘Breaking the Curse’ gameplay trailer shows off 16 minutes of pixel-perfect gameplay.</p>



<p>It has sword and shield action, combat rolling, exploration, tree chopping, dark and spooky forests, and everything you’re likely looking for.</p>



<p>Check out the full 16 minutes of Hytale gameplay right here.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Breaking the Curse | New Hytale Gameplay (16+ Minutes)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rhaqjb_S2X8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We checked the video’s description to look for any extra action or developments. Our pixelated jaws dropped when we read: “This is the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again. There’s a long road ahead, <strong>but early access is coming soon.</strong>“</p>



<p>It’s vague, which is understandable considering how fast this is all happening, but it offers assurances that Hytale is moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Founder Simon also added this to the Hytale gameplay video:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts. One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all.”</p>
</blockquote>
