<p>Both the Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will be getting a physical in the US courtesy of PM Studios, with Reef Entertainment's European release sticking with just the Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>And for those physical collectors out there, yes, the Switch 2 physical will have the full game on the cartridge. That's a nice little announcement, given that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/shuten-order-nintendo-switch-2-edition-out-now-includes-paid-upgrade-for-switch-owners">Switch 2 upgrade <em>just</em> came out last week</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ruhxik&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>So, if you're on the fence about grabbing the game on the newer console <em>and</em> are reluctant to dive into a digital release, then you only have to wait until Spring to get your hands on a fully boxed version.</p>
<p>That cover art is nice, too!</p>

<p>Just in case you've never heard of the game before, Shuten Order is from <strong>Danganronpa</strong> creator Kazutaka Kodaka (who is one of the key writers). The game is a blend of multiple genres but it's ultimately a mystery game where you play as a character who has been murdered, and you must find your killer.</p>
<p>While we praised the ambition of the game on Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/shuten-order">we ultimately felt</a> that it felt a little long in the tooth and not quite up to par with Kodaka's previous works. It looks nice, though, and the Switch 2 version allows you to reach between 60-120fps docked and handheld and use Mouse Mode.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-screenshots-photo-mode-hud-binoculars-2000650620</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As a third-person shooter with just a single gun in its arsenal that lets you scope in, one almost never sees much of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gorgeous environments and explosive gameplay through first-person view.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">Extraction Shooter Player Puts Down Guns And Starts Selling Fruit Instead</a></p> <p>But there’s a way to get a look at post-apocalyptic Italy through the eyes of a Raider: Binoculars. They come with a heavy vignette and some HUD elements to make it feel like you’re using a zoomed scope, but on PC, if you hit F10, not only do you hide the HUD, but the vignetting on the binoculars goes away, leaving you with a suitably grainy image that’s perfect for taking some pretty shots of the game.</p>

 <p>That’s exactly what one IRL photographer, who shares his process on YouTube as Topside Flicks, has done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-trade-fruit-loot-scrappy-lemons-mushrooms-2000649233">leaving behind weapons</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p562bp/you_guys_liked_the_last_binocular_photos_i_posted/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">brave the wilds of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ violent environments</a> to catch some of the most gorgeous screenshots of the extraction shooter yet. Check out some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/BKyBjT-y-pE">gameplay here</a>:</p>

  <p>The grainy-ness of these shots is quite fitting for <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ kitbashed world where Raiders have to make due with what objects they can find to get the job done. I could imagine a photographer in this world hacking together found objects to be able to snap some stills. It really looks the part. Have a gander:</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650627"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000650625"> 				© © Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-photo-mode-bethesda-screenshot-save-location-1850835812">something of an amateur photographer myself</a>, having studied the craft briefly in college; I also grew up with a family member who made a living picking up the camera. I love a good shot, IRL or otherwise, so I had to learn more about the experience of capturing the beautiful vistas of <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ world and freezing in place the sudden and intense bursts of violence the game is known for.</p>

    <p>Topside Flicks, who’s real name is Levi, and I chatted a bit over email. He said that the beauty of the game itself simply demanded he find a way to take shots “I was playing with a friend and I couldn’t stop marvelling at how great this game looked,” he told me. “I’m a photographer by trade so I’m always seeing photo opportunities.”</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650631"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000650632"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> clearly makes for wonderful capture opportunities. Much of this, I suspect, has to do with the lack of color-grading and filters the game uses, as <a href="https://youtu.be/ST_fD5NL_pg">Embark Studios talked about in episode two</a> of their behind-the-scenes featurettes.</p>

 <p>Aside from the practice range, every map in <i>Arc Raiders</i> is an active digital warzone. I asked Levi how dangerous the photo trips are. “I die plenty of times,” he said, “but the beauty of these runs is that I’m not doing any looting, so if I die, all I lose are binoculars and some defibrillators.”</p> <div id="gallery-3"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650633"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-3-2000650634"> 				© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Topside Flicks 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>But as you can see from his videos, Levi isn’t afraid to get up close to some intense firefights to grab a perfect shot. Naturally, he’s had many close calls. “I get set on fire quite a lot in my videos,” he said, “the Fireballs are my arch-nemesis when I don’t have a weapon,” he added, referring to <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-north-line-patch-refiner-fireball-2000644048">the rolling Arc balls</a> that love to cook players with their flamethrowing ability.</p>

While some images clearly have some post-processing edits, as any good piece of photography does, these are some strong captures, and impressive considering he’s jumping headfirst into violent warzones purely for the sake of the craft, not the loot.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-review</link>
            <guid>1373449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far this Star Wars-flavored expansion is a bit cringey, but works surprisingly well.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Destiny has always been the “we’ve got Star Wars at home” looter shooter, and with Destiny 2: Renegades, Bungie has decided to lean into that directly with a crossover expansion. Weirdly enough, so far that decision seems to have kinda worked out alright! Renegades doesn’t solve many of Destiny 2’s longstanding issues, including the fact that it’s been awkwardly spinning its wheels for over a year now (reminiscent of the MCU post-Endgame), but embracing the cheesiness and over-the-top drama of Star Wars is at the very least a surprisingly nice change of pace in what has become quite a predictable universe. The story is silly, to be sure, but introduces a few new mechanics and weapon types that are a welcome change, and there’s an impressive level of enemy density throughout practically all of the activities that keeps the action interesting. I’ve still got a lot more questing and looting to do before my final review, but so far this expansion has been a pretty compelling breath of fresh air in a game I’ve otherwise been far less excited about than usual.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve read any of my previous expansion reviews (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/09/destiny-2-shadowkeep-review"><u>of</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-beyond-light-review"><u>which</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-review"><u>there</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-lightfall-review"><u>are</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review"><u>a</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-review"><u>lot</u></a>), then you’ll already know I am one those weirdo Destiny fans who has stuck with this game through thick and thin – so it should mean something when I tell you that saying I am also a Star Wars fan would be such a massive understatement that I’m actually too embarrassed to elaborate further publicly. But even with my undying love of space wizards, I was initially mortified to learn Destiny 2 was planning a crossover with it. For me, it was the ultimate sign that Destiny was out of ideas, had gone “full Fortnite” in a way that seemed cheap and tacky, and was making one last desperation play during the slow death it’s been suffering for a number of years now. And, yeah, that all pretty much turned out to be true. But when I found myself watching two lightsaber-wielding foes square off in an epic cutscene while listening to the John Williams-esque music this expansion makes heavy use of, I’ll admit it won me over… at least a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renegades does go out of its way to include every little Star Wars reference to a degree that can feel a bit forced – a crutch that’s continuously leaned upon in lieu of any original ideas. For example, you find yourself trapped in a garbage compactor during the very first mission, rescue someone from off-brand carbon freezing, and make a jump to lightspeed while a brooding, masked villain angrily watches you escape his grasp. It’s extremely on the nose stuff, and I was just as likely to experience a full-body cringe as I was to smile about it. But the complete “screw it” energy at play here as it full-throatedly embraces all the corniness and drama for which Star Wars is known does have a certain kind of refreshing charm that’s at least a distinct direction for Destiny 2. I’ve been complaining about this game feeling stale for at least five years now, so I’ve got to give Bungie a bit of credit for trying something new here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also a fair number of new mechanics that I wasn’t expecting, like a shielding system for certain enemies that forces you to deal a whole bunch of damage in a short span of time before you can actually hurt them, AT-ST-inspired walkers that have some unique attacks I wasn’t expecting, and even some new weapon types, like battery-powered guns that can be fired until they overheat and need to cool down. None of this is massively game-changing stuff, but they’re decent little tweaks to the sandbox that are welcome additions. Of course, there’s also a ton of stuff that hasn’t changed at all, and even while you’re facing off against a new kind of enemy in theory, you’ll still be fighting the same Cabal armored warriors and bony Thrall monstrosities you’ve been shooting for over a decade, which has made this feel like a cheap reskin at times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still fairly early into my space opera journey (I haven’t even crafted my lightsaber yet!), so I have a whole lot more to play before I can definitively say where Renegades lands. But so far this expansion seems much better than I expected… though that’s partially because I expected very little. I’ll have much more to say once I’ve completed the campaign and begin to dive into the endgame activities.

            <guid>1373446</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">For gamers of a certain age, Warhammer Quest is a name to conjure with. The original 1995 release was the premier <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon-crawler</a> of its day, a rare cooperative title in an age of head-to-head conflict games. Once it was out of print it became, and remains, highly collectable. But in 2016, publisher Games Workshop resurrected the brand with the well-received Silver Tower. Darkwater is the latest iteration, with a few new tweaks and a lot of new toys on board to try and uphold its considerable legacy.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="5c848b5c-737b-48d3-b764-893eede8d035" id="233318"><div id="233318" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer Quest: Darkwater</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop is rightly known as the premier producer of plastic miniatures and, even by its own exalted standards, the range of figures included in this set are a little bit special. Six of them are heroes, the remainder are their enemies, servants of the noxious, squelchy plague god of the Warhammer universe, Nurgle. The Nurgle range has always been a terrible beauty, crammed with unpleasant details of open sores and drooling maws and there’s plenty of that on display here. But what makes these stand out is a sense of character, something that’s often missing in modern, dynamically posed figures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pop out of your tabletop with an air of individuality, particularly the heroes who display a fine mix of old-school adventurer alongside the current sensibilities of GW’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-dominion-review">Age of Sigmar</a> setting. Facial expressions and poses seem to tell you something about each of them, from the dour scowl of mercenary Bren Tylis to the gloating grin of the central villain, Gelgus Pust. And it’s worth noting for less experienced modellers that the box’s claim of push-fit is largely true. Most of the figures are fairly easy to assemble, although a couple will benefit from a drop of polystyrene cement. Painting them is another matter, however, as the level of detail may be a bit daunting for novices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of the miniatures, GW boxed games often skimp on the remainder of the components. That’s not the case here: this is a lavish production at every level, and you can see where the considerable asking price has been spent. Once you’ve lifted the figure sprues out of the box, the cards and punch-out tokens have their own carefully packed sub-box, with the cards for each of the game’s campaign acts presented in their own sealed envelopes. Although the cards could use more, and more varied, artwork, they’re sturdy, shiny and clear to read.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is a lavish production at every level."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most surprising of all is the book of maps that are used in the skirmish scenarios that make up most of the game. While this is hardly a new idea, most examples are clunky and spiral-bound. This one is hard-bound, yet it still lies flat, making it an absolute pleasure to use. And the maps within are full of the kind of detailed art that we should also have seen on the cards, effectively evoking the plague-corrupted environments of the game’s setting, the Jade Abbey. More detail on the setting and narrative are provided in the game’s rulebook, offering up a great foretaste of the adventures to come.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-195821015-mp-1764789085874.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer Quest: Darkwater is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative board game</a>, but you’ll play with four heroes in every game, so it’s best with two or four players: solo is possible, but you’ll end up juggling a lot as the campaign progresses. It has two game modes, a one-off skirmish fight or a longer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a>. The focus is definitely on the latter mode, as single fights can be unbalanced depending on the scenario you end up playing, and you don’t get the fun of slowly building up your characters and revealing your own narrative of attempting to free the Jade Abbey from Nurgle’s putrefaction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A campaign consists of three acts, each of which sees you dealing out 14 random encounter cards from that act’s deck, with a boss card beneath. You then get a choice of two possible encounter cards for each adventure, and this is an important decision. Many of the encounters aren’t skirmish fights but little narrative snippets or mini-games. Most of these are of the push your luck or risk versus reward variety, but there are a couple of the more imaginative designs that made Silver Tower’s scenarios such a pleasure.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-200931912-1764789104928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to battle scenarios, it’s important to read the cards carefully and consider how the fight might play out. They offer a variety of maps, of enemies to fight, sidequests, victory conditions and special rules. These cause them to vary wildly in difficulty, and some can be almost impossible if you haven’t found certain rewards for your party. This is a big deal because the price for failure is high: you lose some rewards and get to try again, with a second fail ending the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Duking it out on the map is based on a set of rules from another game in the series, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QrAron?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>). Each hero has three action cards: move, attack, and aid. Using one requires you to expend energy, which is most commonly obtained by exhausting one of said cards, either for the action you’re taking or one of the others. Essentially this boils down to heroes taking three actions each turn, which can be any combination of the available options, although some of the rewards you can get later in the campaign complicate the picture a little.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat involves you rolling dice, almost always a pair, hoping to achieve a target number depending on what you’re fighting. Many enemies have a defense value that cancels out an equal number of hits, meaning you’ll have to hit on both dice to hurt them. Between the probabilities involved and the flexibility of the action system, this provides a satisfying balance of decision-making and randomness. This is not a deep game by any means, but you’ll often be torn as to how to best distribute your actions, while the turn limit on completing each battle can lead to some thrilling, high-stakes rolls towards the close.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251119-202234130-mp-1764789122637.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Between each hero’s turn, the monsters get to activate. How they behave depends on a dice roll, and most enemies switch between a sedate black die and a more threatening red die with each passing battle round. Mostly they’ll move toward a target at variable speed and try to attack, although all the monsters also have a special effect: horrible little pox-wretches spawn new companions, while the tough daemonic cankerborn blast all nearby heroes with an area effect attack. This roll can have a major impact on the difficulty of a scenario, as monsters sometimes do nothing and sometimes unleash a terrifying onslaught, a quirk that the rules put down to their chaotic nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One flaw in this system and the map design is that most of the boards have one or more choke points caused by impassable hexes, and most of the scenarios require players to get somewhere and do something in order to win. The result is that both players and monsters get funneled toward the tight corners and scenarios can bog down in repeated roll-offs until you either clear the enemies or the time runs out. Some character abilities and items can bypass this – the dwarf ranger Drolf Ironhead can move through the odd impassable hex – but while this gives some scenarios the feel of a spatial puzzle, in others having one or two characters get a shortcut doesn’t make much difference to achieving the goal. This issue also causes a sense of repetition, despite the fairly varied scenario design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251124-194023242-1764789139244.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Victory, and the completion of sidequest goals, results in reward cards being doled out to the adventurers. Like the scenarios themselves these vary in power, with better items being available later in the campaign, but the more impressive items are often one-shot, while more minor power-ups can be re-used. They all add more tactical options to battles, which is absolutely a good thing. Weighing up whether or not to throw your magical one-off widget into the mix in an attempt to save a scenario that’s going south is always a knife-edge decision and adds extra frisson to the dice-rolls that usually result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even on-board battle scenarios only last about 30 minutes so, when you mix in the much shorter mini-game encounters, playing through an act doesn’t take all that long. “Saving” the game state between sessions is a minor pain but perfectly possible. All the adventure cards have their own text preamble to set the scene and, as you progress through the campaign, there are secrets to uncover and some new playable characters to unlock. The unfolding narrative isn’t going to win any literary awards but it’s effective at giving your playthrough a solid storybook backbone. Nurgle is a particularly fun opponent to tackle, his servitors by turns fatherly and feculent, so freeing the once-pristine Jade Abbey from their clutches feels like a worthy goal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/03/pxl-20251128-113953298-1764789159676.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgmxY?object_uuid=38ddcc60-bd01-4ab2-acfc-c334713f18e4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Warhammer</a>  </li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 4, 2025 6:13 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Compared to the long grind that characterized the last Warhammer Quest game, Cursed City, Warhammer Quest: Darkwater feels like a breath of fresh air. It’s faster, lighter and more approachable, and is very much a coherent miniatures game rather than a box of cool figures with some rules thrown in as an afterthought. Despite the cracking production quality, this won’t win over any GW naysayers: play is still very random and the difficulty is uneven. But the unfolding tale is compelling nevertheless, with enough decision making to engage your neurons and plenty of exciting moments. Fundamentally, whether you’re willing to pay the considerable asking price on this package likely boils down to how much you want the amazing miniatures. But if you do invest, you’ll find that it can capably stand toe-to-toe with a lot of modern dungeon crawl designs.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-quest-darkwater-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love PvE co-op games but murderous robots are giving you low level PTSD, Cast Outs is here to stir up the genre with a modern take on fantasy. Designed from the ground up for co-op, it takes the usual Dungeons &amp; Dragons tropes of goblins, elves and magic spells, and turns them into a 2-4 player playground to battle in. It's got pedigree too, because while it's the first game from UK studio Twisted Works, that studio is home to veterans who have worked on games like Horizon Forbidden Resident Evil 7, Killzone, and the Total War series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Left 4 Dead was one of our early inspirations as one of those games where you had to just realize that you're not going to do this alone," explains James Brace, Twisted Works CEO and the Cast Outs Creative Director.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There is no single player mode. As a studio, when we approached this game we wanted a very sharp, narrow focus on this genre of co-op combat. As a team, you get to experience a whole bunch of missions and modes, different ways to play. We have runs, not unlike the Left 4 Dead kind of experience, but we also have sandbox areas, we have Horde modes. It balances everything we loved about scripted elements - those cinematic wow moments that we love in games like Left 4 Dead - with these playgrounds that allow a lot more freedom of exploration, and a lot more emergent gameplay."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fantasy Co-op Cast Outs First Look</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As one of a team of three refugees from a doomed realm in another dimension, the aim for you and two battle buddies is to fight through a fantastical version of modern day London with a mix of team combos, magical powers and parkour style agility. Talking to the teams there's clearly a lot of thought that's gone into the story - with references to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie, Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Percy Jackson referenced as team favorites, but the focus is also one letting players create their own weird and wonderful Tiktok share worthy moments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're going to have a lot of visual storytelling, what I call passive storytelling. It's there in the world. You can see it. You can absorb at your pace. It can come through the characters. We can have a lot of lore come through the characters like we've seen in a lot of roster based games, but in terms of your adventure, your run, that's your story. The first kind of thing we wanted to try and do is make sure there's enough dynamics in the experience to create unique stories," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, Cast Outs is built with short sessions in mind, but adds a progression system to keep you coming back for more. As well as learning your particular preferred combination of magic and run-based, Roguelike lite upgrade systems, there will be cosmetics to show off your Cast Outs skills and tenure, and a charm system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While playing, you're collecting ingredients. Those ingredients can be crafted into charms - it's where some of the magic still exists in London from the people who came over - and you can wear these charms and take them into battle," says Brace. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You're going to have charm slots so you're going to have dilemmas about how many charms you're going to take in. I'll be going, 'Oh what are you carrying in? I'm taking this.' And it's ultimately driving the progression system to get all the charms and to have the most flexibility on play styles. You'll be able to support your team with charms. A lot of our charms aren't individual. They're helping the team more like perks and buffs for the group. I think people are going to like them because it enables you to um, take the classes and turn your tank into a bit more like a support tank or a bit more DPS."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Planned for release on PC, PS5 and Xbox with crossplay, there's no release date yet, but the Twisted Works team is big on playtesting and building its community to help shape the game. Check out the studio's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tBNw5AnRt7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord</u></a> to find out more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're still shocked that through our play testing that players are telling us about and showing us new ways to play with our own magic that we never thought of, which is absolutely fantastic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Bundled in a thick jacket and scarf to ward off Chicago’s chilly fall winds, congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, 26, approaches an outdoor podium. At a mid-November arraignment, she has just <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/kat-abughazaleh-codefendants-plea-not-guilty-broadview-protest-charges/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pleaded not guilty to federal charges</u></a> raised against her and five other protesters of interfering with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Broadview, Illinois. If convicted, she could face years in prison on counts of conspiracy and intimidation. “This case is not a 'conspiracy,'” she says to gathered media. “It is a political prosecution to silence dissent.” Now she needs to win on election day <em>and </em>in court – which, among other things, makes her fundraising efforts more urgent than ever. Time to play some video games. </p><p>Just a few days later, on November 16, Abughazaleh is in her apartment, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSzcBsmqZME&amp;t=2648s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>streaming <em>Five Nights At Freddy’s</em></u></a> – a game she has never played – to hundreds of concurrent viewers across <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/katabughazaleh?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Twitch</u></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@katmabu/streams?ref=aftermath.site"><u>YouTube</u></a>. She’s taken to streaming multiple times per week since September, following an experimental period in which she and her campaign staff tested its viability as a fundraising tool. The results were more than satisfactory: As the <em>FNAF </em>broadcast progresses, the campaign inches ever closer to having raised $100,000 through livestreams alone. By the end of the night, they pass that milestone.</p><p>Abughazaleh attempts to surveil the game’s titular pizza restaurant while interacting with chat. One viewer asks how she’d support small businesses like, if it existed, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. She replies with a platform that includes taxing the wealthy and lowering taxes for the working class as her eyes dart nervously around the screen. Two of her campaign staff, her producer Asha Buerk and her field director Andre Martin – who are sitting off screen, just a few feet away – give her shit.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSzcBsmqZME?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Campaign Stream #19: Sticker Stream + FNAF !donate !discord"></iframe></figure><p>The mounting in-game tension is clearly getting to her; she notes that where Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, specifically, is concerned, she would simply “set [it] on fire.”&nbsp;</p><p>"We need to be actually supporting small businesses, putting a cost of living exemption for people's personal taxes– oh my god, guys, this is awful," she blurts.</p><p>Not long after, Foxy, one of <em>FNAF</em>’s nefarious animatrons, bursts into Abughazaleh’s in-game command center, prematurely ending her playthrough. She yelps in surprise, eliciting laughter both from chat and those in the room with her.</p><p>Witnessing this scene, it’s easy to forget the gravity of the moment surrounding it. In some ways, that’s by design.</p><p>"Running for office is the most rewarding thing I've ever done, but it's also the most exhausting thing I've ever done,” Abughazaleh told Aftermath while taking a moment to relax on her couch after wrapping up the stream. “It can be grueling at times. People go into running for office excited and wanting to make the world better, but then get worn down by how exhausting it can be. And so a lot of our events are things that bring me joy, that I want to share with other people. We did this punk night that was one of the most fun nights of my life; we had local punk bands come, and it was a night of defiance and community. We've had board game nights. Video games are something I enjoy doing. So it's just another aspect of that."</p><blockquote>"There's no more whiplash going from post-arraignment press conference to <em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em> livestream than there is just living in America right now."</blockquote><p>But these sorts of juxtapositions, Abughazaleh thinks, also come part and parcel with living under – and fighting – authoritarianism.&nbsp;</p><p>"There's no more whiplash going from post-arraignment press conference to <em>Five Nights At Freddy's</em> livestream than there is just living in America right now,” she said. “When we would protest at Broadview on Fridays, Thursday night you would have this tightening in your chest. While driving, you could feel the pepper spray in your lungs, even though it obviously wasn't there. I would always do my laundry on Thursdays so I could strip my clothes off when I got home to make sure I have something that's not covered in tear gas. I would sit there folding laundry on my floor being like 'This is so mundane while all the rest of this is happening.' That is more profound whiplash than anything else. For me, if you can't find joy during fascism, you don't have anything.”</p><h2 id="called-it"><strong>Called It</strong></h2><p>Abughazaleh and her team, a full-time staff of nine, decided to start streaming because they thought it’d be preferable to an especially loathsome facet of campaigning: call time. In short, a candidate directly calls prospective donors in an effort to talk them through goals and, ultimately, convince them to make – or increase – a monetary contribution. This method can be more effective than one-size-fits-all emails or calls, but it’s also arduous and time consuming – not to mention alienating to non-wealthy donors.</p><p>"We did a big recap and looked at our [livestream] numbers as opposed to call time, but also specifically what stream segments were good, which were bad,” Buerk told Aftermath. “We got a lot of positive feedback from our audience and from constituents of not only how good a tool it was for soliciting donations, but for community connection and constituent connection as well."&nbsp;</p><p>Call time, Buerk said, is also only really an effective use of time if people are donating the maximum amount, which is $7,000 from an individual.&nbsp;</p><p>"You have to know rich people,” said Abughazaleh. "That's not me or most of the people that support us. To those who have and can do that, we appreciate you, but we don't want to make that our only base. That means you're depending only on the people who can afford that to make a change in the world. ... You also have to have those [phone] numbers in the first place – or buy lists, and there's no guarantee those lists will work."</p><p>"How do you get those lists?” Buerk added. “It's usually people selling donor data, which we don't do."</p><p>Buerk said that Abughazaleh’s donors were the kinds of people who’d kick in hundreds of dollars, not thousands, and as a result, call time was not exactly pulling in money hand over fist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“In the best of times, we would get $600 an hour [from call time],” Buerk said. “The stream has obviously crushed that. Today we raised $12,000."</p><figure><figcaption><span>Abughazaleh’s cat, Heater (photo credit: Aftermath)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <em>FNAF </em>stream lasted two hours and, thanks to a simple offer of a sticker featuring Abughazaleh’s cat for anyone who donated $10 or more, performed as well as 20 hours of call time. Even during lower-yield streams – the floor, so far, has proven to be $2,000 during a single broadcast – that’s still far preferable a fraction of the money for double, triple, or quadruple the work.</p><p>"Kat is busy at events,” said Buerk. “Kat is dealing with a lot of really insane, horrible things. She doesn't have time to be calling people and trying to convince them to donate for 40 hours a week."</p><p>Streams aren’t easy to do right. While representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez famously pulled a record-breaking number of viewers to <a href="https://kotaku.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-streams-on-twitch-with-hasan-p-1845431479?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a star-studded <em>Among Us</em> stream back in 2020</u></a>, other politicians before and after have tried and failed miserably. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bernie-sanders-new-twitch-channel-needs-fewer-campaign-1835953254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bernie Sanders</u></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-has-a-twitch-channel-now-1838956748?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Donald Trump</u></a> both launched Twitch channels in 2019, but neither engaged with Twitch as a platform or community, instead mostly airing rallies or leaning on campaign staff to host broadcasts. Kamala Harris’ Twitch channel, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamala-harris-twitch-stream-dnc-palestine/"><u>launched last year to little fanfare</u></a>, succumbed to the same issue. Most embarrassingly, disgraced ex-rep Matt Gaetz once <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/matt-gaetz-twitch/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streamed to six viewers</u></a>.</p><blockquote>"Kat is dealing with a lot of really insane, horrible things. She doesn't have time to be calling people and trying to convince them to donate for 40 hours a week."</blockquote><p>In recent times, some politicians have demonstrated greater savvy where streaming is concerned, though they’ve pivoted away from trying to maintain their own channels. <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-adin-ross-donald-trump-kick-stream/"><u>Trump’s 2024 stream with Adin Ross</u></a>, Kick’s king of snivelling suck ups, peaked at over 580,000 concurrent viewers. Tim Walz and AOC <a href="https://aftermath.site/tim-walz-crazy-taxi-aoc/"><u>played <em>Crazy Taxi</em></u></a>. Bernie <a href="https://aftermath.site/bernie-sanders-sykkuno-pokimane-valkyrae-austinshow-vtuber/"><u>learned what a Vtuber is</u></a>. And of course, NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani spent a day hanging out with Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker, which Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://aftermath.site/cuomos-latest-strategy-to-resuscitate-his-flatlining-campaign-go-after-zohran-mamdani-for-associating-with-a-twitch-streamer/"><u>tried to use against him to basically no effect</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“[Streaming] has certainly not been used as a [political] fundraising tool like this pretty much ever,” said Abughazaleh.</p><p>The idea for regular streams came straight from Abughazaleh, no stranger to social media herself, having made her name as a journalist who – in addition to publishing more traditional work at publications like <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/author/katherine-abughazaleh?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Media Matters</u></a> and <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/author/kat-abughazaleh/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mother Jones</u></a> – watched and roasted <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@katmabu/video/7362943343417953582?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a frankly incredible amount of Fox News on TikTok</u></a>. She parlayed this into videos about the far right more broadly, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/democratic-national-convention-creators-palestine-tiktok-instagram-twitch/"><u>advocacy for Palestinians at last year’s Democratic National Convention</u></a>. She owes the successful execution of her streaming plan, however, to a younger-than-average campaign team, with the effort headed up by Buerk, a college student who was “horrified” by rising authoritarianism and decided to walk into Abughazaleh’s office and submit a resume. After stints in call time management and policy, Buerk gave herself a crash course in Open Broadcaster Software (OBS).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I mentioned this idea, and Andre really pushed for it and then gave Asha the tools and ability to just devote time and resources [to learning how to stream],” said Abughazaleh. “It was a big risk; to not do four weeks of call time is a risk on any campaign, but we took it, and it was worth it."</p><p>Martin’s political background is much more traditional: An organizer who was feeling “demoralized” after experiences that included working with the Harris-Walz team and, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/05/john-fetterman-democrat-progressive-senator?ref=aftermath.site"><u>perhaps most dispiriting of all</u></a>, John Fetterman’s campaign, he made a promise to himself that he’d only assist politicians who practiced what they preached. An organizer friend recommended Abughazaleh, and the rest is (recent) history.</p><blockquote>“[Streaming] has certainly not been used as a [political] fundraising tool like this pretty much ever.”</blockquote><p>According to Martin, Abughazaleh’s streaming setup – which includes professional-looking ring lights and a tripod light off to the side, as well as just, like, some lamps – cost the campaign just $160.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We're very lucky,” Martin told Aftermath. “We have a very online section of our volunteer base, and the campaign staff is young enough that some of them have natively already streamed. Getting them to explain it to those of us who hadn't was very helpful in building something from scratch."</p><p>Despite doing an admirable job of replicating the look and feel of your standard, down-to-earth Twitch stream, Abughazaleh is not just some Twitch streamer.</p><p>"We have FEC rules we have to contend with,” said Martin. “We have to go through Act Blue, which was not built to ever be part of a stream."</p><p>This means those who donate have to click out to another page and provide personal info like their occupation and employer. Twitch viewers, who are used to simply pressing a button and receiving a near-instant reaction from their favorite streamer, are not accustomed to this. So far, however, it hasn’t impeded the campaign’s efforts.</p><p>"Being able to still raise this much while going to another website and then inputting information that isn't already there is... I'm really impressed with how it's gone,” said Abughazaleh.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qO8-0b150ZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Campaign Stream #15: HOT ONES STREAM🔥🔥🔥!donate !discord"></iframe></figure><p>But convincing people to open their wallets while riding a wave of novelty is one thing; keeping the money flowing is another.</p><p>"It's very easy for streams to become rote, and while that's good for a certain audience of people, we're a congressional campaign, so it's important that we keep streams engaging and push the meta beyond just 'play video game, react to thing,'” said Buerk. “Obviously you saw us playing video games tonight, but we always need to make sure that there's some form of additional element to keep the streams exciting. So we do higher-level production streams. The most recent goal stream we did was, chat raised $7,000, and so Kat built a Lego set on stream. We also produced a <em>Hot Ones</em>-[inspired] stream where we wrote down a bunch of questions, had the questions on stream, and Kat tried 38 hot sauces."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I did really well on most of them,” Abughazaleh added. “I just wanted that on the record."</p><h2 id="of-ice-and-indictments"><strong>Of ICE And Indictments</strong></h2><p>But a larger question looms over Abughazaleh’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online/"><u>social-media-savvy</u></a> efforts: Will an extremely-online campaign convince voters in her district to spend one day at the polls instead of five nights at Freddy’s? Especially for a young candidate who <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/05/12/9th-congressional-race-schakowsky-replacement/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>moved to Chicago relatively recently</u></a>?&nbsp;</p><p>Abughazaleh would be more concerned if that’s all she and her campaign were doing.</p><p>“For getting the word out, [being] online is great, but it doesn't necessarily translate to votes,” she said. “I think we've seen this in other campaigns, especially by young people, where that translation just doesn't happen. So from day one, we have been translating that online support into tangible actions that people are taking in preparation for election day. For our kickoff event, for instance, people found out about it online, and I asked them to come not with monetary donations, but with pads and tampons, which we were donating to Chicago's Period Collective. And sure enough, we hit max capacity. ... That was an early predecessor to all these things we're doing on the campaign, whether it's asking for people to donate to our mutual aid hub at the campaign office or knocking doors, petitioning, doing phone banking, donating coats, [or] a blood drive for Halloween and a bone marrow registry drive as well."</p><p>"The stream is just another part of that,” she continued. “It used to be that the internet wasn't real life, and now it's not that the internet is real life; they're just both components that exist at the same time.”</p><p>This approach has actually led to <em>less </em>donation money overall than competing campaigns, Abughazaleh said, but more support. Roughly four months from the March 2026 primary, <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2025/11/20/il-09-democratic-primary-poll-shows-early-leaders-four-months-out-from-election-day?ref=aftermath.site"><u>polls show</u></a> that Abughazaleh is tied with another candidate, Daniel Bliss, for first. In relatively little time, she’s managed to make a major impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"We have less [money] than most people, and that's because we're a grassroots campaign, and we aren't supported by rich people,” Abughazaleh said. “Doesn't matter how much money you donate, though; that only translates to one vote."</p><blockquote>"For getting the word out, [being] online is great, but it doesn't necessarily translate to votes."</blockquote><p>In this regard, Abughazaleh has been both encouraged and inspired by the success of another young, progressive politician: Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s soon-to-be mayor who’s already a global celebrity. His campaign, similarly, married consistent pro-working class messaging with <a href="https://defector.com/selling-zohran?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an entertaining but calculated social media presence</u></a> and local events, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-scavenger-hunt/"><u>a gargantuan city-wide scavenger hunt</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"When he won his primary, I posted something like 'Huge night for grassroots progressives with ethnic last names,'" Abughazaleh said. “I feel stronger knowing that Zohran has led the way for a lot of us. It's scary to be doing so many experimental things with your own campaign, but then to see other people trying their own things as well as prove that they can work – and that you don't have to sell out in this way or that way to win an election – is so inspiring to me."</p><p>But also, she added: "We were planning a scavenger hunt for months, and then he did it, and I was like ‘Everyone's gonna think I copied him.’"</p><p>One of Abughazaleh’s ground-level efforts has made national news, albeit not for the reasons she initially expected. Though she’s not outwardly sweating the federal indictment that followed anti-ICE protests in Broadview too much – one which, notably, targeted other Democratic politicians and candidates as well – it has materially impacted the lives of herself and her campaign staff.</p><p>"We – not just me, but people – are trying to do the things that matter, and that means standing up for people. Right now that means you might get beaten up by ICE or a masked man that you're not even sure works for the government,” said Abughazaleh. "We now have legal expenses on top of campaign expenses, but being a candidate at Broadview means I'm not going to go bankrupt. We're able to use those expenses for the other as well.

Few understand this dichotomy better than Ben Collins, aka Tim Onion, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/04/the-onion-sold-g-o-media-global-tetrahedron-1235895683/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CEO of The Onion</u></a> and Abughazaleh’s partner.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not one of those people who do the thing where they track each other on their iPhones,” Collins told Aftermath. “It's disgusting and weird behavior, but it was necessary when she went to Broadview.

But she's uniquely equipped to deal with these people. I think you see it out there: Everyone is following her lead. All these other candidates went to Broadview because of her. She helped amplify what is a clear human rights injustice going on there, both inside and outside that facility. ... So in those few months after [the presidential election] where no one was stepping up, when she told me she wanted to run, I was like 'OK, let's fucking do it.'"</p><blockquote>"[ICE has] all the weapons, they have all the power, and they seem to literally get off on it. And there's a reason they target her over and over again."</blockquote><p>Now, facing down a second, even less anticipated legal battle, Collins – like Abughazaleh – can at least find some humor in it: “It'd be scarier if she did anything wrong, certainly, but it'd be scarier if they <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/kat-abugazaleh-indictment-interview?ref=aftermath.site"><u>spelled her name right</u></a> in the indictment," he said.</p><p>All Abughazaleh can do is meet the moment with the seriousness it deserves, which is both as much as she can muster and none whatsoever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Grinding Gear Games has confirmed that Path of Exile 2: The Last of Druids will drop on December 12. This free update is the third major post-early access debut patch for the hack-and-slash action RPG after <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of the Hunt</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-the-third-edict-update-0-3-0-adds-act-iv-three-interlude-acts-trading-and-several-significant-gameplay-changes-in-massive-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Third Edict</a>. The main features of The Last of the Druids include the new titular hybrid class, a dungeon‑crafting league, and a broad endgame overhaul that lands alongside a free weekend from December 12–15 on PC and consoles. </p>



<p>The Druid is Path of Exile 2's first hybrid Strength/Intelligence class, able to weave between spellcasting in human form and three distinct animal forms: bear, wolf, and wyvern. Its addition expands the game with 21 new Druid skills, over 30 new support gems, 11 uniques, and more than 250 additional passive skills.</p>



<p>From a lore standpoint, the Druid is a survivor of the King in the Mists who lost his humanity in the forests of Ogham and now seeks his missing wife and a way back to his former self. Mechanically, his identity revolves around Animal Talismans, a new weapon type that determines which form he can assume and grants that form’s basic attack as a skill; casting a spell instantly returns him to human form, making form‑swapping a core part of regular combat.</p>



<p>The developers from Grinding Gear have described bear form as raw devastation. Players will be using Maul to generate Rage, then spending that Rage on big slams, Rampage, and the ultimate Walking Calamity, while also converting Rage into Endurance Charges for Ferocious Roar, a warcry Meta Gem that can socket warcries like Infernal Cry or Seismic Cry from other classes. </p>



<p>Wolf form, on the other hand, emphasizes mobility and cold damage: skills such as Lunar Assault, Rake, Pounce, and Cross Slash can be combined to freeze enemies, generate exploding ice fragments, and maintain a pack of summoned wolves, with Pounce acting as a Meta Gem for mark skills from other classes and Lunar Blessing transforming the Druid into an Arctic Werewolf for faster, harder‑hitting attacks.</p>



<p>Wyvern form rounds out the Druid's kit with a mix of melee and ranged elemental attacks built around Power Charges and corpse‑eating via Devour. Rend and Wing Blast inflict melee and lightning damage, Rolling Magma and oil spit can be used for fire and ignite setups, and a channeled lightning Barrage and Flame Breath for sustained ranged damage. All these skills are supported by human‑form nature spells, such as Entangling Vines and Thunderstorms. The latter can inflict the wet status on enemies to amplify shock effects.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Druid_Shaman-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Shaman is one of two available Druid Ascendancies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids launches with two Druid ascendancies, Shaman and Oracle, with a third planned to be released later. Shaman focuses on spellcasting that converts Rage into elemental power: nodes like Druidic Champion and Furious Wellspring tie spell damage and temporary buffs to Rage, while Wisdom of the Maji adds Shaman‑exclusive modifiers to Runes and Idols and Bringer of the Apocalypse triggers roaming multielemental storms after sustained elemental damage.</p>



<p>Oracle uses foresight and timeline manipulation, with Fateful Vision showing future self‑casts of specific skills that gain large damage bonuses when replicated, and Converging Paths enabling Moment of Vulnerability to hit both present and future versions of enemies when they are susceptible to freeze, stun, or electrocution. Ascending as Oracle unlocks more than 130 new passives in the Druid section; allocating The Unseen Path grants access to options such as Self‑Sacrificing, which increases total minions at a higher reservation cost, and Corruption Endures, which adds a small chance to avoid death. </p>



<p>Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids is set to add a fresh wave of support gems and Meta Gems designed to cross‑pollinate class mechanics. Spell Totems, for instance, are a Meta Gem that lets players spend three Endurance or Power Charges to create a totem which automatically casts any socketed spell, opening up new lines of automation for casters and for Druids who generate charges via Rage and Devour.</p>



<p>Over 30 new support gems, including multiple Lineage Supports, are confirmed. Examples include Fan the Flames for fire spread on wind skills, Accelerated Growth for explosive plants grown by rain, Advancing Storm to move storm skills across the battlefield, Echoing Cry for repeating warcries, and Grounding Shocks to turn shocked enemies into lightning beacons. As part of a balance pass, 21 existing Lineage Supports were reworked, and roughly ninety active skills were adjusted across all classes.</p>



<p>On the league side, Fate of the Vaal sends players back to the height of Vaal civilization to challenge the Royal Architect and ultimately Atziri, positioned here as a new pinnacle boss. Xipocado, devoted to Atziri, stands between the player and access to the deeper temple. Overcoming him grants entry to additional crafting tools and a step closer to confronting the queen. Worshipped for her unparalleled beauty, Atziri was the infamous Queen who led her devotees into downfall; now she stands as a new Pinnacle Boss. Rewrite history and alter the fate of the Vaal.</p>



<p>One of the rewards from defeating her corrupted form is Atziri’s Rule. This powerful new staff elevates all corrupted gems and enables players to exchange life for increased damage output. While wielded, Mirrors of Refraction periodically manifest across the battlefield; projectiles fired into these mirrors erupt into a splitting nova and can chain from one mirror to the next, dramatically amplifying offensive potential.</p>



<p>In maps, players encounter corrupted Vaal remnants that attract monsters; powering six of these devices opens a portal to Lira Vaal, an underground temple once ruled by Atziri, where a console allows players to assemble a custom layout using six room tiles per run.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Vaal_Atziri_Cinematic2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Queen Atziri, driven by the impossible pursuit of eternal youth, prepares to sacrifice her empire, forcing players to intervene.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The developers revealed that with Path of Exile 2: The Last Druids, the previous league, Rise of the Abyssal, is being folded into the core game as a permanent endgame mechanic. Abysses will no longer appear in every area by default, but can show up randomly in endgame or be targeted using new Abyss Tablets, which can be crafted to add Abyss‑specific modifiers and now have their own atlas passive tree with options for more monsters, deeper interactions with other leagues, and specialization in particular Abyss factions.</p>



<p>Abyss crafting and Instilling on Waystones are removed entirely to cut down on micromanagement and visual clutter; in exchange, Tablet modifiers are significantly buffed and can be upgraded to rare quality with four mods after defeating the Arbiter of Ash. The developers stated that future leagues will avoid adding more crafting directly to Waystones, while Fate of the Vaal provides an alternative in the form of Tablet corruption, which can yield a range of random outcomes.</p>



<p>Grinding Gear is also pushing to make endgame mapping feel less overwhelming without reducing rewards. Monster density no longer scales up in higher‑tier maps; instead, regular enemies gain roughly 40% more life, drop about 40% more items, and grant around 40% more experience at the top tiers, while monster speed modifiers are toned down and Delirium fog visuals are significantly reduced for better clarity.</p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, the developers have also taken to heart the many complaints about the game's current performance. They claim that Path of Exile 2: The Last of the Druids includes CPU and multithreading optimizations that are expected to improve frame rates by at least 25% in many scenarios and reduce frame time spikes, particularly on consoles. Additional performance improvements are currently under development and will be rolled out over the coming months.</p>



<p>Path of Exile 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-servers-currently-down-early-access-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn't have the best early access launch</a>. Still, one year later, its reception is slowly improving, as evidenced by the fact that recent user reviews on Steam are very positive, with a 93% rating. In contrast, the total review rating (including older reviews) sits at 75%. The Last of the Druids seems to be another solid step toward the full 1.0 launch, which still has no release window.</p>

Studios and Cryptozoic Entertainment aim to bring the quirky energy of the cult show about riffing on cheesy movies to gaming tables, and it is already a major success.</p><h2>The <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>As the campaign page explains, <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Game</em> is a competitive experience where you and your friends riff on key moments in chintzy sci-fi movies.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the broadest strokes, the game is similar to <em>Apples to Oranges</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cards-against-humanity-sues-spacex-for-15-million" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Cards Against Humanity</em>.</a> A Movie Moment card is drawn at random and placed in the playspace. This moment is from a notoriously bad movie featured on <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>, including <em>Manos: The Hands of Fate</em>, and <em>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</em>.</p><p>Each player has a hand of riff cards with different responses, and one player rotates as The Mads, or the judge. All players submit a riff card randomly to the judge, and whichever riff is the funniest gets that player points. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner.</p><p>Interestingly, the game does have some extra modes for more creative tables. Instead of Movie Moment cards, you can simply play a random movie and pause it at certain parts, prompting riff responses. The game even includes several dry-erase cards for submitting your own custom riff. With the right people, this game can turn into a competitive bad movie night blast.</p><picture>

            <title><![CDATA[New Druid Class Headlines Path of Exile 2’s Huge 0.4.0 Update]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-druid-class-headlines-path-of-exile-2s-huge-0-4-0-update/</link>
            <guid>1373395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grinding Gear Games pulled back the curtain on what’s coming next for Path of Exile 2 in update 0.4.0, and it’s one of the game’s largest updates yet. Also known as Last of the Druids, update 0.4.0 releases on December 12 and introduces the long-awaited Druid class, complete with three shapeshift forms, alongside an entirely new league, major crafting systems, performance upgrades, and sweeping balance changes across the board.</p>



<p>The reveal opened with Game Director Jonathan Rogers introducing The Druid, a hybrid Strength/Intelligence class the team says has been “one of the hardest classes for us to design.” The class blends traditional spellcasting with fluid shapeshifting between Bear, Wolf, and Wyvern forms, each built around completely different playstyles. Rogers emphasized that form-swapping is designed to be “seamless and immediate,” letting players weave in and out of forms mid-combat without friction.</p>







<p>Each form offers its own mechanics: Bear specializes in heavy, rage-powered melee; Wolf leans on mobility and cold damage to build a pack of summoned companions; and Wyvern unleashes long-range elemental breath attacks while consuming corpses to gain power charges. Human-form spells like Volcano, Entangling Vines, and Thunderstorm stack on top of that, creating setups that fuel form-based combos. The class also introduces a new weapon type—Animal Talismans—which determine which form is active and provide the form’s basic attack.</p>



<p>The Druid is also launching with two ascendancy classes: the Shaman, which channels rage into spell damage and enhances elemental chaos around the player, and the Oracle, which uses Foresight to predict incoming skill opportunities and unlocks more than 130 additional passives through alternate-timeline “future selves.”</p>



<p>A third Druid ascendancy will come later, but for now, players can look forward to several new support gems, over 20 Druid skills, and a standout unique item called Fury of the King, which transforms Bear form into a fire demon using the Molten Crash slam.</p>

<h2 id="h-introducing-the-fate-of-the-vaal-league"><strong>Introducing the Fate of the Vaal League</strong></h2>



<p>Alongside the Druid comes Path of Exile 2’s newest league, Fate of the Vaal, which dives deep into the lore surrounding Atziri and the ancient Vaal civilization. Game Director Mark Roberts walked through the new league structure, which revolves around uncovering arcane Vaal remnants across Wraeclast. Fully activating them opens a portal into a lost underground temple once belonging to Atziri herself.</p>



<p>The twist is that players essentially build the dungeon themselves. Every run offers six rooms that can be placed to shape the temple layout, link pathways, and position reward rooms. Room interactions matter as much as placement—Garrisons strengthen next to a Commander, Golemworks can power a Smithy, and generators can energize the entire system. Once a layout is set, players enter the temple, clear each room, and begin preparing for the next rebuild.</p>

<p>Things escalate when the player gains access to a prototype time-portal device. Roberts explains that it takes players back to “right before Atziri triggered the cataclysm,” unlocking an entire suite of past-only rooms with some of the update’s most powerful crafting opportunities. These include multi-stage corruption chambers, new Soul Cores, and the league’s wildest mechanic: limb replacement at the hands of a Vaal Flesh Surgeon, complete with random upgrades that disappear when the player dies.</p>



<p>Defeating the league’s Architect boss unlocks special reward rooms and a path to finally confront the Queen of the Vaal in a reimagined boss fight during her moment of transformation. One of the highlight drops is <strong>Atziri’s Rule</strong>, a staff that increases levels of all corrupted gems and causes projectiles to split into novas when fired at spawning mirrors around the arena.</p>







<h2 id="h-rise-of-the-abyssal-becomes-core-in-path-of-exile-2"><strong>Rise of the Abyssal Becomes Core In Path of Exile 2</strong></h2>



<p>Rise of the Abyssal is officially moving into the core endgame, though players won’t see Abysses in every area. Instead, a new Abyss Tablet allows players to force Abysses into maps and craft Abyss-specific modifiers. Grinding Gear has also built a full Atlas tree around the mechanic, letting players specialize in bosses, factions, or internal league interactions.</p>



<p>At the same time, GGG is addressing one of the biggest complaints about the endgame: monster density. Instead of scaling monster counts up by Tier 15, the team is now keeping density consistent and scaling rewards instead. According to the reveal, monsters will “drop 40% more items, grant 40% more experience, and have 40% more life” as tiers rise—without ballooning horde sizes.</p>



<p>The team is also toning down delirium fog visuals, removing Instilling from waystones, and shifting similar power to Tablets, which last ten maps and reduce micromanagement.</p>

<h2 id="h-performance-upgrades-and-huge-balance-pass"><strong>Performance Upgrades and Huge Balance Pass</strong></h2>



<p>Performance is another focus in Path of Exile 2’s update 0.4.0, with Rogers noting players “should see frame rates at least 25% higher” thanks to significant CPU-side optimizations. This includes better multithreading and fewer frame spikes, particularly on consoles.</p>



<p>The update also includes broad balance adjustments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>11 new Unique items</strong></li>



<li><strong>21 rebalanced Lineage Supports + 9 new ones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major ascendancy updates across nearly all classes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rebalancing of 90 active skills</strong></li>



<li><strong>Over 250 new passive skills added</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Roberts confirmed that additional endgame content originally planned for 0.4.0 has been pushed to 0.5.0, but emphasized that a “significant overhaul to the atlas passive tree” and new pinnacle bosses are already in development.</p>

            <p>Action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> is about to get a significant performance boost on all platforms - one that, apparently, will be especially noticeable on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X.</p>
<p>The boost comes from a change in the game's code to allow it to utilise multiple CPU cores better, developer Grinding Gear Games explained in a press presentation for the game that I attended.</p>
<p>"The primary issue is CPU load," co-game director Mark Roberts said, "and to address that a lot of things have been optimised, and we have done a lot of work to take advantage of more of your CPU cores. You should see frame-rates at least 25 percent higher, and a lot less bad frame spikes during gameplay. It does make quite a big difference, especially on consoles."</p>

<p>That 25 percent estimate, however, is an understatement, as I found out while talking to the other game director, Jonathan Rogers, in an interview following the presentation.</p>
<p>"The reason why we mentioned consoles specifically is that they tend to have slower CPUs generally," Rogers said, "which means that on console, you are more likely to run into performance problems at endgame compared to players with PCs. And of course on a console, the hardware is the hardware: you can't upgrade it. You can't do anything about it. It is what it is. So we obviously have to make sure that it's good enough in any situation. That's why there was that call-out specifically.</p>
<p>"I would say, if anything, it's understated. I was willing to commit to 25 percent because I know that we're definitely hitting that, but honestly, in a lot of situations, it's straight up double."</p>
<p>Incidentally, those changes naturally benefit Steam Deck performance as well, and while we're on the topic of handheld gaming devices, has Grinding Gear Games given any more thought putting the game on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>?</p>
<p>"I haven't," answered Rogers. "It's been suggested to us a few times, but... Look, it's not like it couldn't happen. It's just it's one of those things where we have a lot to be doing that isn't that right now, unfortunately. At the end of the day, our engine team is only four people, and we've got a lot of platforms to support. It's one of those things that we can look into once I no longer feel like I've got a problem with performance on the other platforms."</p><p>The performance boost will be one of the many game changes coming to Path of Exile 2 on 12th December, as part of a quarterly update. This will bring, notably, a new druid class to the game and a new league (world) with an underground temple you need to piece together yourself, inspired by the indie game of a few years ago, Loop Hero.</p>
<p>But it's another, smaller, incidental detail - besides the performance boost - that's likely to appeal far more immediately to the Path of Exile 2 playerbase, and that's the dispersing of the Delirium fog. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1pe32vr/a_meme_a_day_until_they_make_a_toggle_to_turn_off/">The game's Subreddit is currently covered in memes about this fog</a>, each of which are a variation on 'I can't see anything because of it'.</p>

</span></p><p>Thankfully, Grinding Gear Games has heard your fog-muffled cries, and toned it down "significantly", Rogers said. It's still there because it's a fundamental part of going to a Delirium world, but it's been dramatically altered.</p>
<p>"Part of the reason why it's an issue is because the game currently has Instilling, and the way that Instilling rewards you effectively meant that it was completely mandatory to use. There is no downside to having it so therefore every map should have it, and therefore every map is just grey fog. So the first thing to do is to straight up remove the requirement to use it," he said.</p><p>"But then there's still Delirium, the league, that we still want to be a thing. So for that, we can't really remove the fog entirely, because then Delirium just wouldn't really be anything at that point - it would just suck. So really, what we need to do is make the fog be a nice experience, so that's what you can see in the [presentation] video where we changed it very significantly. It's not nearly the same as it was before. It's much more fine. So it's fixed in two ways: it's not mandatory and when you do get it, it's way less annoying."</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 is currently available in early access on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">A full 1.0 release</a>, which will include all six Acts in the campaign, will likely not happen until later next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Creative Assembly has announced Total War: Medieval III, a fresh historical entry in the long-running grand strategy series. So long-running, in fact, that this announcement came for the 25th anniversary.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Unfortunately, you shouldn’t expect this game to launch especially soon. Total War: Medieval 3 is currently in early pre-production, but the ambition is to create a game that acts as both a tribute to the classic, and as a revolutionary new entry to push it forward.</p>
<p>The press release reads, “Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical Total War.”</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the studio also talked about the game engine that they use, revealing Warcore to be the next evolution of their proprietary engine. This will be the new foundation for games and capabilities to be built around, but it’s also been designed with console gaming in mind. Total War will be coming to PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

<p>Medieval: Total War was the second game in the franchise, arriving in 2002 after the original game’s Japanese setting. It was followed four years later by Medieval II: Total War in 2006, so it will have been two decades between games that have visited this tumultuous period of European history.</p>
<p>To be fair, it’s been a good long while since a full fat Total War had a historical setting. Total War Saga: Troy and Total War: Pharaoh were smaller scale experiences, so the last main game would be 2019’s Three Kingdoms. It’s the fantasy wargaming of Total War: Warhammer 3 that arrived most recently in 2022.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the support for that game continues – Total War: Warhammer itself celebrating 10 years – with the Lords of The End Times Pack set to unleash four new Legendary Lords into the Immortal Empires campaign in Summer 2026, alongside an End Times update for free.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-warhammer-iii-3-review-pc-kotaku-creative-ass-1848519660"><em>Total War: Warhammer</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/total-war-three-kingdoms-the-kotaku-review-1834993637"><em>Total War: Three Kingdoms</em></a>, there was <em>Total War: Medieval</em> and its successor, <em>Total War: Medieval II</em>. It’s been a long wait. Almost two decades, in fact. But the hit strategy series is going back to Europe. Creative Assembly marked the franchise’s 25-year anniversary on Thursday by announcing <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>.</p> <p>The next <em>Total War</em> promises a return to the series roots but also a future-facing evolution. Here’s the press release:</p> <blockquote><p>Now in early pre-production, this next chapter is both a tribute to its legendary predecessors and a bold revolution for the series. Built as the ultimate medieval strategy sandbox, it will empower players to shape realms, rewrite history, and immerse themselves in the Middle Ages like never before. Combining meticulous historical authenticity with unprecedented player agency, this is more than a sequel, it’s the rebirth of historical&nbsp;<em><span>Total War</span></em>.</p></blockquote> <p>And here’s the live-action teaser:</p>  <p>When’s the game actually coming out? Who knows. It sounds pretty far away, though Creative Assembly is promising a more detailed tease at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards 2025</a> next week. <em>Medieval III</em> will be built in the next iteration of the studio’s proprietary Warcore game development engine, and will also be the first game in the series to come to “PlayStation and Xbox.” Not specifying “PS5” or “Xbox Series X/S” suggests it very likely might be arriving closer to the launch of the PS6 and next-gen Xbox.</p>

 <p>“Please DO NOT mess this one up,” one fan wrote on YouTube. “We have waited 20 years for a new Medieval Total War. Please release a fully functional and fun game.” Another was simply relieved: “<span dir="auto" role="text">I did not expect that this would happen before I die.”</span></p>

 <p>The original <em>Medieval</em> was the third game in the Total War series, and Creative Assembly hasn’t revisited that particular offshoot of its branching strategy franchise since 2006. Here’s how former <em>Kotaku</em> editor Luke Plunkett described <em>Medieval II</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-total-war-games-from-best-to-worst-1535642069">in his ranking of the series</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Perhaps the purest expression of melee battlefield combat the series has seen, its modern replayability is let down by an archaic strategic component. Which is a shame, because this is the last great moddable&nbsp;<em>Total War</em>, and as such is still home to all kinds of wild projects,&nbsp;<a href="https://thebests.kotaku.com/the-best-lord-of-the-rings-video-games-1820380737">including a&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings</em>&nbsp;total conversion</a>&nbsp;which would be close to the very top of this list…were it an actual game.</p></blockquote> <p>Hopefully, <em>Medieval III</em> can set a new standard for massive waves of melee units thrashing each other with more streamlined management elements. In the meantime, there’s no shortage of <em>Medieval II</em> mods to toy around with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Official Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Wojs said fans can look forward to new updates about once a quarter. The last entry in the series, Medieval 2: Total War, was released all the way back in 2006.</p><p>But what is Medieval 3 all about? Wojs said the game aims to be the "ultimate 'What if?' game where you can alter the course of history."</p><p>"We aim to set the scene by immersing you in the historical authenticity you expect from Total War. As you play, the world responds in ways that feel genuinely plausible. You can choose to follow the course as written in the history books or take a bold step towards rewriting it," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to say it will have more to show and discuss over time, and that the studio will "give you a voce to shape certain decisions."</p><p>"But game development is challenging, so we're only going to be able to discuss certain areas when we're confident they're ready to be shown. Through this, we hope to provide more insight than ever before into the development of a Total War title. We're going to make some mistakes, but we're excited to make this journey with you," he explained.</p><p>He went on to say that Creative Assembly wanted to make Medieval 3 for "a very long time" already, and the studio "made attempts to bring it to life in the past, but we never felt we could truly do it justice."</p><p>It's happening now--some 19 years after the last game, 2006's Medieval 2: Total War--for a variety of reasons, including the fact that Creative Assembly is using an updated version of its Warcore engine that is more powerful and feature-rich. Creative Assembly also waited until it could find the right people to make Medieval 3.</p><p>"It was essential to bring together the right people--a team with decades of experience and a deep understanding of what makes historical strategy so compelling," he said. "This expertise, combined with the passion of those who helped shape the series, gives us the foundation to build something truly special."</p><p>Medieval 3 is now in "early pre-production," so it is still "years away," Wojs said. "This phase is about laying the foundations: defining scope, prioritizing features which number in the hundreds at this stage, and shaping how our vision will translate into an unforgettable experience," he explained.</p><p>Wojs went on to say people should expect some "bumps and bruises" in the process of talking to fans about Medieval 3, in part because the studio has never discussed an upcoming game with fans so early in the process. "So please bear with us whilst we find our rhythm," he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How did a YouTube channel dedicated to the craft and history of theme parks become an amazing educational tool for game developers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a question I found myself asking after watching a new video from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Defunctland">Defunctland</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a YouTube channel created by the pseudonymous "Kevin Perjurer," an anonymous individual who has crafted many intricate deep dives into the history of Disneyland, Universal Studios, and other theme park empires.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just because some videos—like one video diving into a Tomb Raider-themed ride at Paramount King's Island—directly intersect with the world of video games. It's because Kevin's research and interviews on high-level designs from the parks reaches beyond what you'd see in game development textbooks. In the case of Disneyland, developers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1305/Everything-I-Learned-About-Level/">are often taught</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to examine the parks' approach to level design like its use of "weenies" to attract audience attention and guide their movement throughout a three-dimensional space.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Disney is often eager to showcase </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-disney-makes-rpg-mechanics-work-in-real-life-at-star-wars-galaxy-s-edge">what's worked well</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in its various parks—but will rarely share any lessons from failures or misfired experiments. Defunctland's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/NyIgV84fudM?si=GGeXHFnp03DqSkcA">latest video</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dives into the "broken promise" one of the company's long-running initiatives: the effort to create "Living Characters."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Living Characters" aren't strictly defined (a fact Kevin bemoans a few hours in), but you could describe them as an evolution of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/jjNca1L6CUk?si=rGou-5td6IBqanMi">animatronics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. They're efforts to bring fictional characters to life in the real world in a manner that can organically interact with park guests and aren't just a person in a costume or mask. They're the non-playable characters (NPCs) of video games brought to the physical world.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-goes-into-a-good-parry-system-" target="_self" data-discover="true">What goes into a good parry system?</a></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyIgV84fudM?si=Dti7ODXPL_uDvrUc" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kevin describes these characters as a "broken promise" because Disney has regularly made (legally defensible) claims that these characters will populate its parks and resorts, but they often appear in a diminished or limited fashion. The reasons are multilayered, and include the challenges of operational logistics, the realities of R&amp;D, and the company's appeals to investors. The full video includes a breakdown of the time Imagineers terrified executives with a giant mechanical dinosaur and an an amazing swipe at Walt Disney for getting his just desserts by being reanimated as an animatronic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Kevin picks through the graveyard of these Living Characters to scrutinize Disney's claims, game developers can loot the open coffins for a number of surprising lessons pulled from real-life NPC design (you aren't allowed to say that's ghoulish if you work on a game where players loot dead bodies).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/news-tower-is-designed-to-nourish-your-inner-history-freak-" target="_self" data-discover="true">News Tower is designed to nourish your inner 'history freak'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Character choice matters">Character choice matters</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The living character initiative showed that a character's personality—and audience familiarity with them—plays a major psychological role in how players interact with a game or feature.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the successful living characters that made it from R&amp;D all the way to Disney's parks is Turtle Talk With Crush, a theater-based experience where guests can chat with the laid-back turtle character from Finding Nemo. The attraction is effectively digital puppeteering, where a human actor chats with a theater full of families while a digital model of Crush tracks their movements, using a mix of canned animations and real-time tracking to create the illusion of an animated character physically interacting with the real world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Defunctland, Turtle Talk With Crush evolved from two other prototypes: Stitch's Picture Phone and Mickey's Toon Elevator. The latter experience was Disney's first attempt at letting guests talk to interactive animated characters, featuring its flagship mascot Mickey Mouse. The technology was repurposed for the Lilo &amp; Stitch-themed attraction Stitch's Picture Phone, which was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/u-_pCkTnRPo?si=ygnsSzfqCzkbxaUF">tested with guests</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in Disneyworld's "Innovations" experiment in Tomorrowland.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/creating-the-card-based-rpg-battle-suit-aces-game-developer-podcast-ep-59" target="_self" data-discover="true">Creating the card-based RPG Battle Suit Aces - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 59</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The choice to put Stitch and Crush in these experiences wasn't purely about film promotion. Defunctland says that Imagineers faced concerns over what we now call "brand safety" for putting Mickey in such an exposed position—but more importantly, that guests might have a genuinely bad time if Mickey behaved in a way they didn't expect.</span></p><p>Image via Disney</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A throwaway comment or awkward social encounter wouldn't fit their image of Disney's magnanimous mouse, the upbeat perfect host whose behavior and voice has been documented through a century of animation. Because only three actors (including Walt Disney himself) played the beloved mouse, a park actor who couldn't nail the slightest nuances of Mickey's voice could unsettle guests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stitch, Crush, and other Park animatronic park characters speaking with guests don't carry that baggage. More importantly, their personalities afford flexibility when interacting with guests of different backgrounds. "There's no expectation Stitch would provide any level of attention or emotional concern," Kevin noted in his video.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If a guest is rude to Stitch, it's in-character for him to have a sassy retort or hiss and walk away. Crush has the vibe of a laid-back California </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>stoner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> surfer and any sarcasm or diversions from errant guest behavior come off as playful and relaxed since he doesn't seem to care about anything. These also soften the blow of technical glitches or awkward pauses in conversation, letting the mere marvel of speaking with a cartoon do the heavy lifting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That freedom has limits. Defunctland noted how strange it is that so many park actors hit on guests, and too much riffing can feel like a bad comedian doing crowdwork, flattening what makes these characters special. But the mere existence of a "sweet spot" for character interactions and the popularity of features like Turtle Time With Crush shows is measurable data about how the right personality can make or break a player's experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There's a thin line between attraction and distraction">There's a thin line between attraction and distraction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why doesn't Disney's Star Wars-themed Galaxy's Edge attraction feel like a fully-inhabited fantasy world? What if it's because filling it with Living Characters could disrupt the flow of the park?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fellow video essayists like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=mRTzB62sYMxCzER3">Jenny Nicholson</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> argued in her popular 2024 video about Disney's now-shuttered Starcruiser hotel that it felt like Disney had made big, expensive promises then cut corners by putting the most premium role-playing experiences in an expensive hotel, one of many cost-reductions measures across Disneyland and Disneyworld. Kevin echoed this argument in his Defunctland essay.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When you spend years promoting a land as a living, breathing place where you can immerse yourself in a Star Wars story, and build an environment that appears to be designed for Living Characters and interactions, and you accomplish this for one day when the media is there to review it, regular guests get a little upset," Kevin noted, also laying out how the division between different division's marketing and operations budgets shape when and where characters appear.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in the video's closing moments, he spotlighted design nuances that may show Disney should have never made those promises to begin with: Living Characters are crowd-drawing attractions unto themselves, and their realism may be so mind-boggling it undermines any role-playing potential.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 1963 when Disney unveiled the Enchanted Tiki Room attraction, it promoted the restaurant full of animatronic talking birds with a single animatronic barker sitting outside the building that caught guest's attention. Guests paid attention all right. They gathered around the parrot, blocking access to the attraction.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The animatronic was quickly shuffled away.</span></p><p>Image via Disney</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2017 Disney tested "J4KE The Droid," a Star Wars droid autonomously wandering through Disneyland's Tomorrowland area of the park. Guests would block J4KE's path to take photos with their kids. Kids walked up and kicked and grabbed J4KE.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the last couple years, with the rollout of the new "BD-X" droids (distant cousins of BD-1, the companion droid from Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi series), park attendants have had to constantly follow the little duck-like machines as they waddle through the park, again warding off errant children and managing the crowds that stop to watch them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These moments spotlight a fascinating tension in game design. In live-action or digital role-playing experience aliens and droids wandering a town are meant to feel organic, even boring. They simulate the everyday life of a fictional world and players treat them as such. In a park, they are amazing creations that draw the eye away from events.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to avoid the complexity at the heart of this dynamic. If you asked ChatGPT for a key lesson, it would likely say "designers need to consider player traffic when designing levels."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kevin's observation is that humans are flawed creatures and these flaws make Living Characters in public spaces untenable. "Even if Mickey Mouse could be a fully autonomous bipedal animatronic with character-specific language learning model and perfect speech synthesis, that Mickey could not shake your hand when you enter the park and walk with you to get an ice cream because the costumed Mickey [actor] can't do that. He would be mobbed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But developers would benefit if they can zoom out to the biggest picture possible. My takeaway: context can drastically alter the very nature of a game experience, and the subtle differences can sometimes be difficult to perceive or describe. A small group encounter with a Living Character is immersive. A crowd encounter is a show. The instance when one moment becomes another is blurry, and it can be easy to not see when the context has shifted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Human psychology, however well documented, is remarkably fickle. But it can still be harnessed to make your game sing when artificiality struggles to keep up.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The human touch matters">The human touch matters</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/is-nvidia-s-ai-driven-npc-tech-just-really-expensive-improv-">written before</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about my experiences at Galaxy's Edge and how actors playing the characters of Kylo Ren and Vi Moradi offered different flavors of how to delight and deter guests in the park. Defunctland drove home how, despite the passion from Disney (the man and the company) for autonomous interactions, human choices are what delight players and park guests.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, watch my interaction with Kylo Ren for a sample of this dynamic at play.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YNegoSdHmBA?si=FY1iHzHFrTGR2M5N?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an interaction between a would-be Supreme Leader and undercover Resistance operative, it's boring. As a personalized moment for a guest at the park, it felt amazing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Defunctland highlighted what was almost the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>opposite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reaction of this from video of the guest experience in the Starcruiser hotel. The hotel rooms contained what may have been one of the most advanced Living Characters ever created: a maitre'de droid named D3-09. D3 was an advanced interactive chatbot who interacts with guests as part of their adventure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Most guests reported growing bored with D3-09 quickly, while finding the interactions with the human performers rewarding and engaging," Kevin explained. Children apparently found the droid more engaging, but children also "think costumed characters are real." He laid out how most concepts for designing artificial intelligence operate on the idea that the human interacting with the machine will be operating in good faith. But they may not even need to be operating in bad faith to undo the magic. It can evaporate if they're confused or inattentive.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Human interaction—direct or indirect—is much more sticky. In an in-person encounter, an actor can look at the people around them and intuit what behavior will provoke a certain response. In game design, developers customize different interactions with some sense of what the player will feel on other side. Even in procedural content or emergent multiplayer experiences, the strongest emotions emerge when one human looks at another over some distance and thinks "I want this person to feel this way."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Achieving the illusion of life does not necessarily require fully-autonomous free-roaming self-directed character agents," Kevin said in his four-hour video essay's final moments.

            <title><![CDATA[Metroid Prime 4 – Scout Bot Location Guide]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/04/metroid-prime-4-where-to-find-scout-bot-guide/</link>
            <guid>1373320</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the curious things you will stumble across early on when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> is a lifeless scout bot crumpled to the floor. What does it do? Can it be revived? Where are there more of them? That’s what we’ll set out to answer in this quick guide</p>
<h2>What do Scout Bots do in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Scout Bots are, to put it simply, item locators. Once activated, they will spring into action, marking all of the remaining items within a region on your map for you, so that you can fully power up Samus.</p>
<h2>How can you activate Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>Activating a Scout Bot needs you to shoot it with some electrical juice to power it up. This means you need a lightning gun, which is one of the later unlocks for Samus’ new suit of armour in Metroid Prime 4. This is very much a late-game kind utility, for when players have the majority of Samus’ abilities and can actually reach and grab almost all of the items that a Scout Bot will locate.</p>


<h2>Where are all of the Scout Bots in Metroid Prime 4?</h2>
<p>There is one Scout Bot located in each region on Viewros, and if you’re attentive as you explore each location, chances are you’ll find all of the Scout Bots. You can make a note of which room and general area they are in using markers on the map (or by making a written note). Or… well, here’s where they all are:</p>
<h3>Fury Green</h3>
<p>Right near the start of the area, you’ll find the Scout Bot in the room branching off from the main path. You really can’t miss it… but you might forget exactly where to go by the time you can activate it!</p>


		
		

<h3>Volt Forge</h3>
<p>The Scout Bot in Volt Forge is tucked a little out of the way down on the side platform of the second generator. That could be quite a chore to get back to, but it’s much easier later in the game.</p>
<p>From the entrance area of Tower 1, head to the elevator opposite the Save Station room. Instead of taking the elevator, scan for a pipe on the right side of the room, which you can rip open using the Psychic Lasso. Hop in as a Morph Ball and this takes you down to the side of the generator of Tower 1.</p>
<p>Use the Psychic Grapple to swing across to the main platform of Tower 1’s Generator, then head straight over to the other side platform and scan for a Psychic Boost Rail. Roll in with the Morph Ball and boost to shoot yourself across to Tower 2’s Generator. Battle the robots here and on the other side platform you will find your Scout Bot. Also… there’s maybe an item near here!</p>

		
		

<h2>Ice Belt</h2>
<p>This one’s super simple. The Scout Bot is off to the side of the frozen wasteland where you have the battle with the pack of wolves. Return here and look to the right and side as you come down the slope to see it.</p>

<h2>Flare Pool</h2>
<p>Another easy to reach one. Drive through the opening area of Flare Pool to reach the shut down bridge and river of lava that you had to cross to reach the main facility. Bike across the lava and head to the right hand side of the maintenance grate. Hop over the bollards and you’ll find the scout bot and a little puzzle to complete once you’ve unlocked the Morph Ball tether.</p>

		
		

<h2>Sol Valley</h2>
<p>Sol Valley’s Scout Bot is pretty handy, given just how big and open space it is! You’ll actually be able to reach the Scout Bot right from where you first land in this region. If you’re coming out of Volt Forge, turn left after exiting the structure and you should see an island just detached from the cliff edge to the world. Activate some Psychic Platforms to jump across and you’ll find the Scout Bot here.</p>

		
		

<h2>Great Mines</h2>
<p>And finally, the Great Mines. I’ll keep things pretty light here, as we’re getting towards the end of the game. See a big spiky green thing? It’s to the left.</p>

		
		

<p>And that’s all of them! With the Scout Bots collected, you’ve still got time for hunting down all the remaining items you have to get Samus fully kitted out for the game’s grand finale. Good luck with that!</p>

Even third-party creator-made modes have been nipple-free, with a high-profile promotional crossover with body hair shaver brand Philips featuring a smooth-chested model. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Epic Games now re-add nipples to previous skins, restoring characters like Kratos to their fully chested glory?

    <p>While playing <em>Horses</em>, I was filled with dread for a revelation that never came. “This is creepy,” I thought, “but surely there’s some big thing in the next scene that pushes the envelope too far.” Yet despite the drama, I am here to tell you that <em>Horses</em>, the cause célèbre from Italian developer Santa Ragione that has now been prevented from being sold on <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>Steam</u></a> and the <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-steam-epic-games-store-banned/"><u>Epic Store</u></a> and was <a href="https://aftermath.site/horses-santa-ragione-delisted-relisted-epic-steam/"><u>temporarily delisted from the Humble Store</u></a>, isn’t that troubling. Yes, it contains disturbing scenes of sexual violence and abuse, but so do many great works of art. The acts themselves are cartoonish, goofy, and self-censored. If this is what’s considered the limit for which games can and cannot be sold on mass marketplaces, then we’re all in trouble and everyone involved in that decision should be thoroughly embarrassed.</p><p><strong>Note: The following features images and plot details from the game <em>Horses</em> which some people may find disturbing.</strong> </p><h2 id="high-horse"><strong>High horse</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <em>Horses</em>, you play a 20 year old man named Anselmo who has been sent by his parents to work on a farm for the summer. The game is entirely in 4:3 black and white, and the sound of a film projector is heard in the background constantly, with speech rendered in text cards like a silent film. The farmer shows you around and introduces you to his livestock: a pen of “horses” that are actually just naked (yet blurred-out) people in horse masks. “These are my horses, they’re my pride and joy,” he says in subtitled Italian. You then proceed to get on a horse piggyback style and do a goofy jumping mini game while a player piano noodles in the background.</p><figure><figcaption><span>There's a lot of weird dinners with mouth noises, but the game provides a Misophonia warning at the beginning. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the game goes on you are instructed to do various errands around the farm (water the plants, chop wood, feed the “dog”) as revelations about the nature of the horses reveal themselves. The farmer tells you that fornication between horses is forbidden, and that you must report any horses that you catch in the act. You come to learn precisely why the horses are like that, what motivates the farmer, and witness various acts of punishment and sexual violence. Importantly, these acts are rarely shown explicitly; all nudity is censored, and much of what is done is occluded in a stylized way. It’s easy to draw immediate thematic parallels to Ionesco’s <em>Rhinoceros</em> or Peter Shaffer’s <em>Equus,</em> although the most obvious comparison is Pasolini’s <em>Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom</em>. Both are deeply Italian works about power, the body, and sexuality, although <em>Horses</em> is censored, does not feature real people, carries far less baggage, and is nowhere near as complex by comparison.</p><figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtkbDNNrFoY&amp;list=RDWtkbDNNrFoY&amp;start_radio=1&amp;ref=aftermath.site"></a><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/WtkbDNNrFoY?si=AjzN9YULjy63DGUu&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>The farm</span></a><span>. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Horses</em> is a sophomoric game in both good and bad ways. The sex acts themselves often feel like the Unity asset version of two naked dolls being slapped together. Often this is funny, and the game can carry an absurd, cartoonish delivery that feels <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distancing_effect?ref=aftermath.site"><u>intentionally alienating</u></a>. It is a cumbersome game to play, deliberately slow in the way that artful indie games tend to be. Its message and metaphors about sex and repression land with the subtlety of a brick, which I find a little charming in an Italian, absurdist way. But these scenes can overstay their welcome, and the symbolism feels, appropriately, a little tortured.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The broken man. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are moments of grief and loneliness I find genuinely striking in <em>Horses</em>. There is a scene of a gelded horse man on his knees in a field, his mask’s eyes dead and his will to live severed from him. He is broken. And yet there are other times where I found myself saying “I get it” as the various tasks take forever and their intent is obvious. Yet despite being long in the tooth at times, the message of <em>Horses </em>does land and is immediately parsable by anybody with a passing familiarity with any art form that isn’t video games. It’s a message that resonates far louder given that Valve and Epic seem terrified and deeply confused by a work that could not be any clearer if it tried.</p><h2 id="what-the-hay"><strong>What the Hay?</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>I don't think you can pet the "dog." Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>In different circumstances I do not think <em>Horses</em> would be controversial, a game mainly noteworthy among people who like intentionally unpleasant art horror games. To play it after all this is deflating; so much controversy over…this? This makes its de facto ban confusing, damning, and downright weird — it constantly feels like there’s a part of the story not being shared. I’ll concede that it is understandable that a game with this content would trigger alarm bells. Santa Ragione speculated that a scene in an early build where a “young girl” rides the shoulders of one of the horses may have led to Valve<a href="https://www.horses.wtf/BannedFromSteam/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> rejecting the game in 2023</u></a>. But they also claimed that they aged the girl up to an unambiguously grown woman and found it to work better in the context of the game – a point I agree with having actually played it and seen the content of the scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The scene in the final game. You walk a woman through a pen on a person's shoulders while she talks to you. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>The doubling down from Valve without any specificity or opportunity for appeal is damning enough, but the sudden 11th hour banning on the part of Epic raises eyebrows even further (Santa Ragione <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too?ref=aftermath.site"><u>says</u></a> the Humble delisting was temporary so the storefront could “reevaluate” the game.) Scandal sells, and this is great marketing on Santa Ragione’s part, or it would be if the way that PC games are sold was not <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-steam-santa-ragione-horses-ban/"><u>functionally oligopolistic</u></a> (although you can still buy the game on GoG, Humble and Itch). You need only play the game or watch a playthrough to realize just how embarrassing it is that this game has been made a pariah. This is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irr%C3%A9versible?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><em>Irréversible</em></a>. But regardless of how you feel about <em>Horses</em>, it is undeniable that it has become an important work merely by existing and being deemed deviant.</p><p>Both Valve and Epic have been vague and contradictory about what triggered the bans, with the latter pointing to <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines?ref=aftermath.site"><u>policies</u></a> around “explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated” and a “‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policy” that prohibits abuse of humans or animals. This can only be read as nonsensical ass covering, particularly in the light of Epic seemingly reapplying for the game’s IARC rating last minute, which is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolecarpenter.bsky.social/post/3m73wyv6tw225?ref=aftermath.site"><u>by all accounts</u></a> objectively weird behavior.</p><p>If the invalidating content was slavery, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/final-fantasy-xvi?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Final Fantasy XVI</u></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/fallout-new-vegas--ultimate-edition?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fallout: New Vegas</u></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dragon-age-origins-ultimate-edition-ca4fbf?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dragon Age: Origins</u></em></a> would never be allowed to be sold. If torture is unallowed, then <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/grand-theft-auto-v?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>GTA V</u></em></a><em> </em>violates Epic’s terms of service with “By The Book,” a mission where Trevor tortures a guy by pulling his teeth out with pliers and electrocuting his nipples on behalf of the government. Americans understand and respect graphic violence, torture, and abuse as art, and on that front <em>Horses </em>is far less graphic than any 30 seconds in a recent <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mortal-kombat-1?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Mortal Kombat</u></em></a><em> </em>game<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>And even if we were to limit this to the topic of sexuality, you do not have to go too far on Steam to find far more depraved games that Valve is fine with publishing. Hell, if we were to narrowly limit our criteria to the specific topic of uncensored half-equine hybrid penis, one of my favorite games of the year, <a href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-manbreaker-did-not-break-me-challange/"><em><u>Baby Steps</u></em></a><em>,</em> clears <em>Horses</em> easily and can be bought on Steam and PSN.</p><p>What this underscores is the sheer danger of market consolidation in gaming. While companies like Valve and Epic do not legally have to carry a game, to not do so is functionally a death knell for that game on the PC; Santa Ragione has <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-is-scary-humiliating-and-patronising-santa-ragione-facing-closure-after-horses-barred-from-steam?ref=aftermath.site"><u>said</u></a> it threatens the studio’s continued existence. This is not equivalent to a theater chain declining to carry a movie; this is two (mostly one) American companies more or less deciding what content is commercially viable across most of the world, in ways that are somehow more vague and opaque than the MPAA. This is a hegemony of American prudishness, applied globally, incoherently, unevenly, and unseriously. Anybody responsible for these decisions would be vaporized in seconds by a Pinku movie from the 1970s, and if a single person in this chain of command has an arts degree they are pretending they don’t for the sake of an ill-defined idea of business. <em>Horses </em>cannot be the ceiling for what is artistically and commercially possible in games, because otherwise we are in deep horseshit.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va5_rn3vG3A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Krusty the clown - What the hell was that?"></iframe></figure><h2 id="broken-horses"><strong>Broken horses</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The scene where the woman tells you in no uncertain terms what the game is about. Credit: Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite my minor issues with the game, I want to talk about a scene in <em>Horses</em> that I love. It is the scene that Santa Ragione speculated may have caused this controversy, the one with the “young girl” that changed during development. Despite its reputation, it is not actually a scene about sex, but rather one about money, deviancy, and power. As you guide the daughter of a businessman riding horsepersonback she makes explicit what is often implicit in life.</p><p>“I know what you're thinking. I know these aren't real horses. But...you know, the way they used to live...A lot of people find that unacceptable. I don't care, personally. But usually, people exhibiting immoral behavior also have dangerous ideas. Like my dad always says, each of us is a cog in the machine; we must all do our duty so society can function properly. So dangerous ideas are a concern for everyone. Because if the machine jams, everything falls apart. And we can't allow that to happen! The farmer... He does what he does. And my father...Well, my father makes sure that his business opportunities keep growing. It's simple: In this world, on this farm...everyone who lives their life recklessly and indulgently ends up exactly where they deserve. Do you know what I mean?”</p><p>I cannot claim to know the minds of the people who shot down <em>Horses</em>, but the vagueness and hypocritical nature of their responses point to an unspoken rule: Art that is deemed a liability to business must be avoided without question. Gaming is often many things, but its status as gambling and toys take higher precedent than its ambition as an art form. How these decisions are made is arbitrary and capricious with supposedly immutable guidelines that can, somehow, change in a heartbeat for the right game.&nbsp;</p><p>A private company pulling a game from distribution the day before it was set to be released is a punishment for being “reckless and indulgent”--not censorship, in their own telling, but a game maker ending up “where they deserve.” Banning <em>Horses </em>is an exercise in power, and to quote Pier Paolo Pasolini: “Power can essentially do what it wants, and what it wants is completely arbitrary, or dictated by economic needs that elude common logic.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="35655e5426fe6"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/35655e5426fe6/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While the Switch and Switch 2 are portable systems that come with their own built-in screens, I've often been drawn to pairing Nintendo's hybrid consoles with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch">portable monitors</a> when I'm on the road and away from my TV.</p>
<p>One of my favourite choices for the original Switch is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#the-premium-choice-espressodisplay-v2">Espresso V2</a>, a premium 1080p screen which doesn't even need the dock – you can connect the console via a USB-C cable and power the screen using another USB-C-based power brick.</p>
<p>You can imagine, then, how excited I was when Espresso Displays offered to send out the 4K version of their screen to test with the Switch 2. <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-pro?variant=47210169860328">The £650 Espresso Pro 15</a> boasts a 15.6-inch, 60Hz LCD panel capable of displaying 1.07 billion colours and weighs 800 grams. With its anodised aluminium casing and super-tough glass front, it's the kind of screen I can see myself taking on the road with me – but there's one big drawback.</p>

<p>It seems that Nintendo has changed the way the Switch 2 outputs video through its USB-C ports, so you need the dock to run it on external displays like this – and that means using Espresso's own HDMI-to-USB-C cable, <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/hdmi?variant=46000850272488">which comes at an extra cost of £60</a>.</p>
<p>Even then, there are issues. Espesso's aforementioned cable has an extra USB-A cable built in for additional power to turn on the screen, but this cable isn't physically long enough to reach the USB-C port on the Switch 2 dock.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to place the dock next to a wall socket so I could plug in a USB power brick to juice up the screen. Alas, even this isn't enough to bring the display to life, so <em>another</em> USB-C power supply was required, plugged directly into the Espresso Pro 15's second USB-C port.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the Espresso V2 required a similar setup (both of its USB-C ports were occupied), but the need to use the dock and an extra power supply for the HDMI cable is somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the fact that the Espresso Pro 15 isn't using an OLED panel is a disappointment, as the difference is definitely noticeable; while the LCD screen seen here is bright, it lacks the punch of other displays I've used, such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/which-1080p-portable-monitor-is-right-for-your-nintendo-switch#when-1080p-just-doesnt-cut-it-innocn-pu15-pre-15-6-4k-oled-monitor">INNOCN PU15-PRE</a> (which is also 4K).</p>
<figure data-uuid="f56ae2becb514"><a title="Hands On: Espresso Pro 15 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f56ae2becb514/hands-on-espresso-pro-15-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the bundled <a href="https://uk.espres.so/products/espresso-stand-plus?variant=46757226938600">Espresso Stand+</a> makes this even more appealing for gamers. Using powerful neodymium magnets, the screen bolts onto the stand with ease, and even allows you to spin the display 90 degrees for some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tate-mode-nintendo-switch-games">TATE-mode shmup action</a>. The Stand+ is adjustable and comes with two height settings, making it quite versatile.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that I used the Espresso Pro 15 from a gamer's point of view. However, its maker describes it as a screen aimed at professionals, and it's certainly more successful when viewed from that perspective. It can be powered using a single USB-C cable, which also connects to your Mac or PC and turns it into a second display, complete with touch support. That's a far more elegant solution than having to use a dock and two power supplies, as is the case when playing on it with a Switch 2.</p>
<p>With its lofty price tag and dependence on an additional extra in the shape of a specialised HDMI cable, it's hard to recommend the Espresso Pro 15 if you're <em>solely</em> looking for a portable gaming screen to use with your Switch 2 – but if you in the market for one that can double as a work monitor <em>and</em> a gaming one, then it might be worth a look.</p>
