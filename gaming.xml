			<p>WB Games Montreal is reportedly working on a new DC Comics game. A <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/jobs/r000085749/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3_t9JnHabk1U9HUAfChMB_jfoMoBnXSjRgdZkq22JxMrzlVBoK38ifnBU_aem_f7-dwYdH8yYWRm7zPmTy8Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job listing</a> for a Senior Producer was uploaded, with the text saying that they are looking for someone to join "its Game Development team, working on AAA titles set in the DC Comics Universe." However, that part of the text was removed, and it now just talks about working for the WB Games Montreal division of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. The entire job description was posted on Reddit, but some of the text has since changed on the official website. A screenshot of the <a href="https://x.com/Jsig212James/status/1843680988733551090" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original text was posted on X</a> by a user named James Sigfield.</p>
<p>It was also uploaded to the WB website, and it was also caught on LinkedIn, which described the roles of the job, including helping oversee "all phases and teams of development of a single project, from the concept phase through its release." From the sound of the job description and the responsibilities that they are asking for, it seems as if the project is in very early development.</p>
<p>Whoever gets the job will be asked to create a milestone roadmap, as well as deliver the milestones "from concept to ship" as well as helping to manage the production budget for the title. WB Montreal has made some very well-known games in the DC universe, such as Batman: Arkham Origins as well as the more recent Gotham Knights. 2024 saw the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, but the game received middle-ground reviews from critics but overwhelmingly negative reviews from consumers due to the game being full of bugs and server issues.</p>
<p>Looking at the Wikipedia page for the game studio also suggests that a new DC Comics game is in the works, as it's listed that the game is TBA but that the game is in production using Unreal Engine 5. Whether this is true remains to be seen and likely will not be confirmed until the game is announced or until Warner Bros. makes a statement about the information. However, considering that they scrubbed the text to remove the DC Comics segment from the job description, it seems unlikely that they would publicly come out and provide any information about the Senior Producer role or whether they are actually making a game in the DC Games universe.</p>

I love how Gallica, my fairy companion, sits on my shoulder as I walk through the streets of its fantasy setting. I enjoy reading all the chatter that pops up from the citizens as I make my way from one side of a city to the other. <em>Metaphor </em>isn’t an open-world game, but its towns are still decently sized and take a minute to get around on foot. Sure, you can fast-travel and miss out on all the ambient dialogue, but if you do that, you’re denying yourself one of the greatest simple pleasures of the game: skating around on your sword.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,193583,196578" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Yeah, swords aren’t just for swiping, slashing, and stabbing in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>. They can also be made into a magical, floating skateboard. Doing so gives you a boost in speed as you traverse the giant cities and small villages of the United Kingdom of Euchronia. But it also gives you some special dialogue from onlookers as you zoom past them. Some will remark in awe as they’ve never seen a sharp blade turn into a skateboard before. Others will choose not to mind their own business and claim that you’re trying to get attention and disrupt the peace. It turns out that being weird and annoying to the youth trying to skateboard is another part of the real world <em>Metaphor</em> manages to capture in its fantasy universe.</p><p>While the protagonist of <em>Metaphor </em>can use different weapons depending on which Archetype or class they’re using, the skate-sword is a mainstay when you’re running around civilized areas. This makes some sense, because if you were playing as the Gunner Archetype, skating on a floating crossbow doesn’t sound practical. But I do wish it were possible to skate in some of the wild areas and dungeons you come across throughout <em>Metaphor</em>’s 80 or so hours. Though you of course need your weapon in hand in those areas so you can stab or shoot an enemy as they approach, but it sure would make some of the backtracking you have to do in later dungeons a bit breezier.</p><p>As I reflect on my time with <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, it still strikes me how much Atlus was able to adapt <em>Persona</em>’s formulas but still iterate on them meaningfully when moving to a fantasy setting. While I walked through the alleys and streets of Tokyo in <em>Persona 5</em>, I always felt like my own two feet were enough to get me where I needed to go. But <em>Metaphor</em>’s world feels bigger than these discrete slices of the real ones, and so it’s only natural that we need a new way to move through it. The skate-sword may look a little silly out of context, and maybe more whimsical than fitting for the dark political drama of the rest of the game, but it is one of the biggest quality-of-life changes Atlus could have made for <em>Metaphor</em>. When you play the game on October 11, get in the habit of whipping it out every time you’re in its cities. There’s no drawback, and you’re walking around enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One way to navigate a massive sale like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime's Big Deal Days</a> is to shop for the really cheap stuff like $5 Blu-rays and $10 video games. Another way is to find a deal on something expensive that you've been eyeing for a while, like a top-of-the-line 65-inch OLED TV, and finally take the plunge. As you can probably guess from the headline, this article is about the latter sort of deal--Amazon has major markdowns on Sony Bravia televisions and accompanying sound systems during its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales event.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/littlebigplanet-3-all-dlc-to-be-delisted-october-31-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, on the <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1843652568389480651%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LittleBigPlanet X account</a>, an announcement was posted regarding the future of <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/littlebigplanet-3-review-sackboy-friends-create-wonderful-memory/">LittleBigPlanet 3</a> and LittleBigPlanet DLC on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp; Created by Media Molecule, LittleBigPlanet was developed by Media Molecule, with the first game being released in 2008 on the PlayStation 3. In total, there have been six games in the franchise, with the latest main installment being titled Sackboy: A Big Adventure. However, with this announcement being posted on X, it seems that LittleBigPlanet may be no more. This post explains that this is the last chance for people to purchase LittleBigPlanet 3 and the DLC from the PlayStation Store. LittleBigPlanet 3 has been available for ten years, and now it seems that it is time for the game and all LBP DLC to be removed from the PlayStation Store as of October 31, 2024.</p>
<p>While the game is being delisted as of October 31, those who own the game as a physical or digital copy will still be able to access the content of the game. The announcement was listed so that those who haven't obtained the game yet are still able to access the game, with this as a final reminder. Whether this means that the servers will still be up is uncertain at the moment, but considering the servers for most previous games in the franchise have been closed down over the years, it seems likely that LittleBigPlanet 3 will follow suit.</p>
<p>As it stands, none of the LittleBigPlanet games are available to purchase digitally anymore, as they have all been delisted from the PlayStation Store, with LittleBigPlanet 3 being the last to go. Fans are in uproar about this, as it feels as if "years of DLC and community are getting erased," as <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/reminder-little-big-planet-3-all-dlc-will-be-delisted-on-oct-31st-2024.1003713/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one person comments</a> in response to a thread on Resetera.</p>
<p>Although the statement is worded in such a way by saying "friendly reminder" to purchase the game before it's gone forever, this is the only reminder that those who are fans of the franchise have been given, and it's less than a month's notice for people to purchase the game. It's likely that people who want it would be able to buy it cheaper as a physical copy from retailers still selling it or in thrift stores, but those who are using a digital-only console will be out of luck.</p>
<p>Additionally, October is a very stacked month for games, and in a time of financial crisis across the globe, it's going to be hard for people to decide whether they will choose to purchase a game before it's gone forever or choose to buy a game that has come out recently so that they can be in line with others.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/learning-how-to-emote-in-diablo-4-could-reward-you.1004274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/learning-how-to-emote-in-diablo-4-could-reward-you/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several quests across Sanctuary, including one in Kyovashad, task you with utilizing an emote in Diablo 4 to cheer on guardsmen, interact with chests, or summon spirits at an altar. On top of the quest-specific goals, the emote wheel also allows you to connect with other players, chanting a class-specific greeting or challenging them to PvP. Here’s how to use the emote wheel in Diablo 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Use Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>To use the emote wheel in Diablo 4, press either ‘<strong>Up</strong>‘ on the d-pad of your controller or ‘<strong>E</strong>‘ on the keyboard to access the wheel. From there, you can sort through three separate tabs of the wheel, with each holding eight total emotes. There are some you cannot swap out, however. For example, you’ll want to ensure you have Zoom, Leave Dungeon, Invite to Party, and Invite to Trade readily available on the wheel’s first tab so they’re easily accessible. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can customize the available emotes by opening the wheel and selecting “Customize” using the prompt below the emote wheel on the right-hand side. From there, it will open a new menu in which all your available emotes appear in a scrolling menu, which you may then add to the wheel.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-new-emotes-in-diablo-4">How to Unlock New Emotes in Diablo 4</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various questlines and seasonal objectives in Diablo 4, you will inevitably unlock new emotes. The best way to earn new emotes is to complete the game’s season. The battle pass contains a handful of unique, sometimes class-specific, emotes that unlock once you level up far enough. However, many will only become available once you buy the premium pass, which costs real-world money to unlock.</p>



<p>Furthermore, some of the game’s quests and content will unlock emotes as rewards, so don’t forget to play through everything available!</p>



<p>How are you enjoying the brand-new season of Diablo 4 and its first expansion, Vessel of Hatred? Let us know in the comments below, or visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forums</a> to start the discussion!</p>



<hr>



<p>Can you believe <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 has made over $1 billion dollars in revenue</a> already? It’s all thanks to that cosmetic in-game shop and its egregious pricing, but I’m guilty of decking out my Barbarian in unique cosmetics, too.</p>

                <p>The Last of Us has a reputation as being one of the best video game series of all time for many reasons. You have to do a lot of different things right to earn that sort of lasting acclaim--there's no "one weird trick" to success. But one of the key factors is certainly the original score by Gustavo Santaolalla, who won consecutive Oscars in 2006 and 2007 for his compositions for Brokeback Mountain and Babel. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days sales event</a>, you can save big on this huge vinyl box set of Santaolalla's music from both The Last of Us games.</p><div title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2727" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">The Last of Us 10th Anniversary Vinyl Box Set</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box\/dp\/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Last-10th-Anniversary-Vinyl-Box/dp/B0CWHF232B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$76 (was $110)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This expansive set includes eight discs of music from both the original game and its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, by composer Gustavo Santaolalla, with packaging and sleeves adorned with very striking art by Ashraf Omar.

It worked so well, in fact, that Santaolalla also composed the music for the HBO series.</p><p>Speaking of which, the 4K Blu-ray for Season 1 of HBO's The Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay, is also on sale for Prime Big Deal Days for just $21, down from its list price of $45--pretty good for eight hours of TV.</p><p>There are many, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>many</em> other deals to peruse during Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days event</a>, though you'll need to be an Amazon Prime member to participate. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sign up here</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> is heading to PS4 and Xbox One on 24th October, following its launch in 2022 across current consoles and PC.</p>
<p>The release will include the base game, all free content updates, and the Multiverse of Nonsense DLC.</p>
<p>What's more, it has cross-ownership integration meaning existing owners on current consoles can play on the equivalent previous console. However, only Xbox has cross-save integration too.</p>

<p>Goat Simulator 3 will also feature local two-player splitscreen, and two-player online multiplayer (on the same platform).</p>
<p>"We're thrilled to be able to give PS4 and Xbox One players access to our baa-rilliant game," said Santiago Ferrero, creative director at Coffee Stain North. "With 8th generation consoles joining the party, Goat Simulator 3 will now be available on 8 different platforms… As the kids would say, we really 'ate' with this announcement – they do still say that, right?"</p>
<p>In more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> news, the remaster of the first game will be released on 7th November.</p>
<p>Goat Simulator: Remastered will launch across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S over a decade after the original release. It will come with improved graphics, a re-worked mutator menu, and all DLC.</p>
<p>"You've waited 10 years, now we ask that you wait just one more month," said Joel Rydholm, producer at Coffee Stain Publishing in yet another tongue in cheek comment. "Goat Simulator: Remastered is going to knock your socks (hooves?) off, and we promise it'll probably be worth the wait. We're so excited to see what our fans think!"</p>
<p>Goat Simulator 3 was notable for its announcement trailer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-takes-down-goat-simulator-3-ad-that-used-leaked-gta-6-footage">incorporated leaked footage from GTA 6</a> - publisher Take-Two soon issued a take-down notice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite is about to get quite villainous. According to a new leak, Fortnite is set to receive three new Disney villains relatively soon.</p>



<p>HypeX, who is known to post various Fortnite leaks, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1843659867053343017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted Tuesday</a> that Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil, and Maleficent will be available when the next update drops.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The additions come as part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/disney-buys-1-5-billion-stake-in-epic-games-will-create-expansive-universe-within-fortnite/">crossover deal</a> between Disney and Epic Games. As far as in what way they’ll be added to the game hasn’t been confirmed. One thing Disney has made known is that not every character added to Fortnite will be able to use guns, which would limit their ability to be used in the classic Fortnite Battle Royale. </p>



<p>“Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Epic EVP Saxs Persson told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> last week. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”</p>







<p>Disney and Fortnite’s collaboration will continue to grow aside from the additions of characters to the game. Epic Games and Disney are also working on new games as well as a full Disney universe within Fortnite.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Disney villains coming to Fortnite? Let us know in the comments.</p>

The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J9XDMQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">11-inch 512GB model is $1,049</a>, and if you need a bigger screen, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-13-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7ZX58?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">13-inch model is $1,349</a>. You'll need to click the coupons on the respective pages to get these discounts.</p><p>If you're looking to get an iPad for more general use, there are also some deals on older models. For general browsing and bedtime Netflix, there's the 2021 base iPad for $258, while the sixth-generation iPad Mini with 64GB of storage capacity will cost you $350. In the Macbook department, Amazon is offering the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-15-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23GFMJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2024 MacBook Air for $1,044</a>. This is a pretty powerful laptop, as it has a 15-inch liquid retina display, a powerful M3 chip, and 256GB of storage capacity, making it a solid workhorse to lug around. For something a bit more compact, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX23V2ZK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's a 13-inch version for $849</a>.</p><p>Pairing these with headsets is also a good idea, especially if you're sticking with Apple so that you can take advantage of extra features. The standout deal here are the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds for $168 (was $250), as these little titans provide exceptional active noise-canceling, dynamic sound, and a USB-C connection for fast-charging. You can also check out the premium AirPods Max for a deluxe experience, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as the USB-C model is $499 for Prime Day</a>. If you don't mind a Lightning connection, you can save even more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and get a set of these elegant cans for $395</a>.</p><p>Artists can also benefit from Prime Day, as the Apple Pencils are on sale. You'll want to check the compatibility of each model before you decide on a price, but if you're looking to explore the world of digital art, these are game-changers. You'll be amazed at what you can create on an iPad with an app like Procreate or Adobe Fresco, and these stylus devices feel very comfortable to use. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first-generation Apple Pencil</a> is a little dated but can still work just fine on older iPads, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">second-generation model</a> is ergonomically superb to use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Pencil Pro</a> is the best of the bunch, as it offers an impressive number of gesture-based controls and haptic feedback features. Finally, you can pick up an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Nano-Texture-Height-Adjustable/dp/B09V3HR5DJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Studio Display for $2,000</a>. Admittedly this is <em>very </em>expensive, but this is a pretty big price drop and these displays are popular with creative professionals due to their high-quality design and rich selection of colors.

Most of these are led by Colin Farrell, who is unrecognizable in his role as Oz Cobb aka The Penguin, and they add the briefest moments of levity to an otherwise heavy crime drama.<br></p><p>The most recent episode begins with a tragedy: The flooding of Gotham by the Riddler, first seen in 2022’s <em>The Batman</em>. We see how it affects Oz’s reluctant new henchman, Vic (Rhenzy Feliz), who over the course of the episode slowly settles into his role, discovering he might actually like being so flush with cash he can pay off cops. It’s also the start of Oz’s partnership with the deliciously unhinged Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti), who seems to be perpetually on the precipice of killing someone in her line of sight, like a coiled cobra in the grass. But despite all the tension simmering through episode three, I couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p>At one point, Sofia brings Oz to the factory where her team is hard at work on a new psychoactive drug that she smuggled out of Arkham. As an eccentric chemist explains the drug, cultivated from some freaky-looking mushrooms, in increasingly more scientific ways, he throws a few Latin words out there. Oz immediately snaps, “what the fuck you say to me?” like Tony Soprano with his hand on the butt of a gun. I guffawed.</p><p>Moments before that, Sofia shows up at Oz’s apartment, where a terrified Vic is forced to play the gracious host. She moves around the room, clearly disgusted by Oz’s interior decorating choices, picking up a remote like it’s covered in toxic waste. Vic goes to tell her what it’s for, but before he can finish, she clicks it and a huge electric fireplace kicks on. “Tacky,” she mumbles.<br></p><p>She’s not here to hang out though, they have an errand to run. Oz instructs Vic to remain in his apartment instead of tagging along. “Stay put,” he says, closing the door behind him. He opens it again immediately after and hisses, “If you do anything stupid, I’ll sense it.” It’s a master class, guys.<br></p><p>Though the rest of the episode is pretty high-stakes, there are consistent dashes of humor sprinkled throughout that consistently startle a peal of laughter out of me: Oz responding to a rival gang leader asking if they’re staring a coup with “What are you, reading books or somethin’?”, Vic splitting a gunman nearly in half with Oz’s plum-colored Maserati (it’s not purple, as he reminds us in episode one) just when you think our Penguin is done for, and Oz responding “fuck it, leave her,” when Vic asks what they should do about Sofia, who was also in the line of fire. They speed away in the destroyed Maserati while “Me And The Devil” plays.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-hbo-series-episode-1-review-recap-batman-1851652226?_gl=1*cd1doq*_ga*MjA4NjU1MDY4Ni4xNzE0NjU5MDky*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyODQwODAyOC45NS4xLjE3Mjg0MTAwMjYuNjAuMC4w">Every single episode of <em>The Penguin</em> thus far has been like this</a></span>—terribly tense mobster moments that Oz gets out of by the skin of his one gold tooth, punctuated by surprisingly riotous riffs. It’s the best show on TV right now, and surprisingly one of the funniest. The fourth episode of <em>The Penguin</em> airs on Max on Sunday, October 13.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
