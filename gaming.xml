            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble or paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

            <p>
The thing about an adaptation, is that sometimes you've got to twist things slightly to better do what you want to do. Whether that's the right choice or not depends on how militant you are about the concept of faithfulness. When it comes to The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">Witcher</a> series, however, I expect most people won't care, except for the author of the original books Andrzej Sapkowski himself. His personal gripe? The very existence of different witcher schools.
</p>
<p>
In The Witcher games, there's various Witcher schools that crop up here and there, with Geralt of Rivia coming from the School of the Wolf. Except according to a recent AMA with Sapkowski on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-author-andrzej-sapkowski-says-one-of-cd-projekts-big-story-points-is-actually-based-on-a-mistake-but-videogame-people-have-clung-to-the-idea-with-remarkable-tenacity/">PC Gamer</a>), the whole idea of schools was completely blown out of proportion. "The issue of 'witcher schools' requires - I apologise - a longer explanation," Sapkowski wrote. "A single sentence about some 'school of the Wolf' mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot."
</p>
<p>
For some context, The Last Wish is the first book he wrote in the series. The author goes on to explain that he didn't include any references to any other schools in any of his other books from that point on. "However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these 'witcher schools.' Completely unnecessary."
</p>
<p>
Sapkowski also noted how he's not sure how he wants to go about dispelling this idea of schools, suggesting removing any mention of them in future editions of The Last Wish, or even just outright expanding and clarifying the idea in future books. "Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit."
</p><p>
I have to admit, this does tickle me quite a bit. I'm not a mega Witcher fan, I enjoyed the third one enough, but the schools did feel important enough to be relatively memorable. And they're just not really a thing apparently!
</p>
<p>
Ultimately Sapkowski's comments don't really matter as the games have obviously taken on a very large life of their own. I doubt there'll be anyone at CD Projekt Red who's going to lose any sleep over this either.
</p>
<p>
In any case, there was meant to be one last Witcher 3 patch this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3s-final-patch-delivering-cross-platform-mod-support-has-been-delayed-until-2026">but that recently got the boot to 2026</a>. I'm sure you can wait a while longer for your cross-platform mod support.

              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it. And if you’re looking for spooky movies ahead of Halloween, I’ve included plenty on the list below.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>A Quiet Place</em> -$15 ($35)</li> <li>A Quiet Place Part II – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Air Force One</em> – $15 ($27)</li> <li><em>Batman Begins</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight</em> – $14 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> – $13 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Returns</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Forever</em> – $13 ($25)</li> <li><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Clueless</em> – $14 ($26)</li> <li><em>Cloverfield</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Dredd</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> – $15 ($34)</li> <li><em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em> – $14 ($30)</li> <li><em>Evil Dead Rise</em> – $14 ($17)</li> <li><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Friday the 13th</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Get Out</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Gladiator II</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Inglorious Basterds</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Mother!</em> – $11 ($24)</li> <li><em>Poltergeist</em> – $13.72 ($34)</li> <li><em>Reservoir Dogs</em> – $11 ($13)</li> <li><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Split</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director’s Cut</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home –</em> $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek First Contact</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Insurrection</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Nemesis</em>— $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> – $15 ($23)</li> <li><em>The Thing</em> – $12 ($30)</li> <li><em>Titanic</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>TMNT: Mutant Mayhem</em> – $15 ($38)</li> <li><em>Top Gun</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Transformers One</em> – $15 ($36)</li> <li><em>Transformers Bumblebee</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>The Untouchables</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Us</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em> – $10 ($23)</li> <li><em>Wayne’s World</em> – $11 ($26)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony have teamed up with Reebok to create three special sneakers to celebrate <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/the-limited-edition-30th-anniversary-ps5-consoles-look-fantastic/">thirty years of PlayStation.</a> There are three designs and all are quite tasteful, personally I’d love a pair of the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II kicks, but there is zero chance of that happening.</p>
<p>That’s because each of the three designs is exclusive to single store, in a single country.</p>


<p><br>
First up is the Reebok Workout Plus.</p>
<p>“Get fit, be fit with the stylish PlayStation | Reebok Workout Plus trainers. With two lace options, removable lacelock cable attachment, internal arch band for enhanced fit, and anniversary grey sockliners, the Workout Plus trainers are made for play.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the UK from <a href="https://www.endclothing.com/gb">End Clothing</a> from 15th October.</p>


<p>Next up is the Reebok Pump Omni Zone II.</p>
<p>“The Pump Omni Zone II are the ultimate throwback trainers. Featuring a custom pump ball styled in PlayStation colours, two lace options with metal tips, and tonnes of rad retro details, these kicks will have you balling in style, on the court or with a PlayStation controller.”</p>
<p>These are only available in the USA from <a href="https://cncpts.com/pages/new-york" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-3767a0f2-6251d66c">CNCPTS</a>&nbsp;starting 17<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;October.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, we have the Reebok Instapump Fury 94.</p>
<p>“Step back to where it all began. The original PlayStation launched in Japan in 1994, and these throwback trainers pay homage to the classic console with a pump ball with “Press Play” feature, a memory card design on the tongue, and fun, hidden details in the retro design.”</p>
<p>These can only be purchased in Japan from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beams.co.jp/en/shop/j/" rel="nofollow" data-di-id="di-id-40e706b6-e9584e22">Beams</a>&nbsp;starting 24th&nbsp;October.</p>
<p>No doubt these will be expensive to purchase and if you really, really, <em>really</em> like PlayStation and Reebok <em>and</em> have more cash than Jeff Bezos then you might want to grab one of 750 limited editions box sets that contain all three designs.</p>

			<p>Hades 2 v1.0 is here, and even though it's been in early access for over a year, there are plenty who waited for its full launch before jumping into Supergiant's latest.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Myself included, as I said in my review</a> of Hades 2, I avoided the sequel so I could have the same experience I had with the first game. Now that I've spent a good deal of time with the game and have felled Chronos and reached Olympus' peak, there are a few nuggets of wisdom I feel ready to share.</p>



<p>Starting with what is undoubtedly the only thing that the action fans of the first Hades game are curious about when it comes to jumping into Hades 2. How good are the weapons and which one is the best?</p>



<p>This tier guide will go through which are the best weapons in Hades 2, and where their pros and cons lie, even if they're not always what you want to grab on your way down into the Underworld, or up towards Mount Olympus.</p>



<h2 id="h-hades-2-weapons-tier-guide">Hades 2 Weapons Tier Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-s-tier-the-sister-blades-lim-and-oros">S-Tier: The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The Sister Blades, Lim and Oros, in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting with the best of the best, there is really only one weapon sitting at the top of Mount Olympus compared to the other five Nocturnal arms available to Melinoë, and it's the Sister Blades, Lim and Oros.</p>



<p>They're the fastest weapons in Hades 2, with each of their starting aspects all extremely viable for wherever you are in the game. They don't need certain boons to be powerful; you can build around them easily, no matter what you're trying to lean into.</p>



<p>The Special lets you hit multiple enemies with different curses quickly, and while the two aspects you can unlock are more than viable, Melinoë's own aspect is already so powerful that you don't need to focus your resources and efforts on upgrading anything else.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-tier-the-witch-s-staff-the-black-coat-and-the-moonstone-axe">A-Tier: The Witch's Staff, The Black Coat, and The Moonstone Axe</h3>



<p>Half of all the Nocturnal Arms sit in the A-tier, because they're all better than the rest but none are as good as the Sister Blades. </p>



<p><strong>The Witch's Staff, Descura</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Witch's Staff in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Starting off with The Witch's Staff, Descura, which is also the first weapon you'll have available to you right at the beginning of Hades 2. The Staff is similar to your starting sword in the first Hades. It's an all-around solid choice, even with a reliance on its charged attacks that really make the Staff shine. You'll definitely want to be levelling up your mana bar throughout your run with this weapon equipped, or have Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, but that doesn't hold the staff back from being a strong choice.</p>



<p><strong>Moonstone Axe, Zorephet</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Moonstone Axe in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Zorephet, the Moonstone Axe's major drawback is that it's unfortunately slower than you might like for a typical run in Hades 2. That said, the aspect of Thanatos changes that, bringing it up to speed so you'll be able to do the immense amount of damage the axe already does even faster.</p>



<p>Even without the aspect of Thanatos, the Moonstone Axe more than makes up for its slow attack speed with the massive amounts of damage a single hit can deal. It's Special attack is also great at taking out multiple enemies and dealing Curse damage to every enemy in any given encounter since it easily reaches across most of the tighter spaces in Hades 2. </p>



<p>Yes, you might need to get used to how slow it can be, and you might not find your groove with it until you've unlocked the aspect of Thanatos, but even before that, it is a solid choice to build around and one of the better weapons to use in the game overall.</p>



<p><strong>The Black Coat, Xinth</strong></p>



<figure><figcaption>The Black Coat in Hades 2</figcaption></figure>



<p>Perhaps the biggest drawback to The Black Coat, Xinth, is that it's the last weapon you'll unlock out of the six. That doesn't stop it from reaching above the other weapons you'll have had more time with by the time you get to it.</p>



<p>It's a jet pack that launches missiles and punches through enemies like nothing else. What more could you ask for, really? How it changes your sprint might take a bit to get used to, but it's Special attack lets you hit multiple enemies at once, its main attack is quick and akin to the speed of the Sister Blades, and one of its aspects even unlocks a powerful hidden Hex that is otherwise unavailable to you.</p>



<p>Like every other weapon mentioned so far, it's fairly easy to build around and doesn't require any particular boons or upgrades to be effective.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-tier-umbral-flames-ygnium">B-Tier: Umbral Flames, Ygnium</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Umbral Flames in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Umbral Flames can take some getting used to, and like the Witch's Staff, it's reliant on you having a large mana bar or Arcana cards like The Unseen equipped, so you're not running around without the use of your charged attacks. That said, there's more to these flames than meets the eye when you first grab them in hand.</p>



<p>Its range lets you do consistent damage while staying out of the line of fire, and its Special orbiting around you helps keep enemies at bay when you don't have your Cast available to you. It's Eos aspect also adds a slow-moving grenade ready to do massive damage on top of the damage you're already dolling out with its base attack. </p>



<h3 id="h-c-tier-argent-skull">C-Tier: Argent Skull</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Argent Skull in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This will probably be the most controversial placement for this whole list, because yes, the Argent Skull, Revaal, can be massively powerful - if you have the right upgrades. That's why I have it all the way down in C-tier.</p>



<p>Out of all six weapons, the Argent Skull is the most 'great with the right upgrades' weapon in the game. At least for me, in a roguelike, that's not the marker of a good weapon choice. Without those upgrades, it packs a strong punch but makes you grab your ammo after firing.</p>



<p>I'm not saying this weapon isn't viable - all six can lead you to a win at the peak of Mount Olympus or in the depths of the Underworld, including the Argent Skull. But out of all of them, it's the one that comes with the biggest asterisk, because not only does it only get more useful with the right upgrades, it actively puts you in harm's way with how you'll need to move across each encounter to keep the skull loaded and ready to fire.</p>



<hr>



<p>Ultimately, these rankings are based on my own experiences with each weapon, and what you prefer might be different. Just make sure to give each a try to find what you like and what fits your playstyle.</p>

            <p>
It's been a while since we've had a new game from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director Cory Davis. As far as I can tell, the last game he made was 2016's Here They Lie, a survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game. He's currently working on another horror game in fact, Sleep Awake, which is a horrendous name, though I think it's doing some interesting things. Weirdly, he's making the game alongside Nine Inch Nails guitarist (for live shows, anyway) Robin Finck, and while the game doesn't have a release date, it did just receive a demo.
</p>
<p>
Lemme tell ya, if there's one thing you can take away from Sleep Awake it's that PS3 games are back! Let me define what I mean here so I don't just sound like I'm trying to press some buzz words for the fun of it. I think a key thing about the PS3 era of games is that there was so much more scope for much more intimately designed, linear spaces, with much more room for detail compared to the PS2, but not quite enough resources to design something completely lifelike.
</p>

<p>
In a lot of ways, these intricately designed games often just had facades up, they looked bigger and more impressive than they actually were. The upside is that it also often made for interesting art direction, and a better established sense of space. So many big budget games now do look life-like, but the tradeoff is that all of this detail gets lost through the sheer quantity of it.
</p><p>
Sleep Awake's demo was only short, and very much felt like one long corridor, but it was an interesting to look at corridor. Your classic case of random bits of graffiti and wall carvings to denote story, interacting with random objects that does nothing but let you look at them close-up, data logs with bits of flavour text to build up the lore, it's all there.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of lore, or story I suppose, this game is set in a world where there's some kind of weird illness thingy that whisks people away if they fall asleep, so the protagonist is doing what they can to stay awake at all times, which occasionally leads to some hallucinations.
</p>
<p>
To be perfectly honest, the narrative didn't feel all that compelling. As mentioned, the demo was short, and did quite a bad job of bringing me into this world, it felt too jarring and disconnected. There also just wasn't really anything to actually do apart from walk around, look at some bits, and one very short section at the end where I had to hide from an enemy. I'd be remiss to not mention the fact that the writing was stilted and awkward, and the main character's performance matched that feeling a little too well unfortunately.
</p>
<p>
Still, the atmosphere and visuals pulled me in all the same. There's parts that are intercut with live action footage which, to its credit, actually unnerved me. A real arthouse, '70s vibe about it I feel I could really get down with. It is certainly going for a unique look, and I felt charmed by its 2009 throwback vibes, even if I'm uncertain of whether it'll be any good or not.
</p><p>
Still, it's a curious thing to have a game from someone that designed one of the most discussed games of the 2010s, and someone that plays guitar for Nine Inch Nails sometimes. Worth a punt! You can try it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>

            <p>
With Call of Duty: Blacks Ops 7's 14th November release date looming and its early access beta just days away, Activision has aired a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">big old Call of Duty Next showcase</a>, featuring - amid the enthusiastic shouting and endless "official partner" promotion - a heap of multiplayer news and gameplay, including a look at Warzone's new Resurgence map, and more.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty Black Op 7's open beta, as you probably already know, runs 5th-8th October, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-open-beta-starts-2nd-october">early access beginning Thursday, 2nd October</a>. Things kick off at 6pm in the UK/10am PDT and those taking part will have access to six 6v6 maps. There's Blackheart (an off-shore oilrig), The Forge (a Tokyo R&amp;D facility), Toshin's downtown Tokyo, Exposure (the Australian outback), Imprint (an Alaskan weapons manufacturing facility), and Cortex's human testing site. Zombies fans, meanwhile, can try out the Vandorn Farm survival map, with beta pre-loading starting tomorrow, 1st October.

<p>
Still on maps, Activision also used its showcase to whizz through a few of Black Ops 7's 18 launch maps (16 for 6v6 matches, two for the series' new 20v20 Skirmish mode). Colossus, for instance, is a Black Ops 2 "callback", while Den takes players to a Japanese castle full of 2035 tech. There's Express, set in a Tokyo train station; Hijacked, whose action unfolds on a Tokyo Bay yacht; Homestead, set in and around David Mason's Alaskan childhood home, plus Paranoia - a more fantastical map inspired by the nightmare of David Mason's mind. You can see those and more in the flythrough trailer above, but if your mappetite still isn't sated, Activision says a further seven multiplayer maps will arrive as part of Black Ops 7's post-launch Season 1 plans, alongside two Survival maps and one round-based map for Zombies mode. Nuketown 2025, for instance, is due "shortly after launch".
</p><p>
Weapon-wise, Black Ops 7 features 16 new multiplayer weapons at launch, including the M10 Breacher - a pump-action shotgun that can be charged to reduce spread and land mid-range shots with more accuracy. Additional weapons (both new and returning favourites) are promised - alongside the likes of attachment rewards and weekly challenges - once Black Ops 7's post-launch seasons get underway. We also got a peak at some of the new Weapon Prestige attachments and camos coming in Black Ops 7, with Activision promising a "big" year for camo fans. Alongside a dedicated camo track in the co-op campaign, there are 16 mastery camos (split across multiplayer, Zombies, Warzone, and co-op), plus plenty more coming as season rewards.

<p>
Rounding out the multiplayer portion of Activision's showcase, there was a brief bit of Black Ops 7's "very competitive" new Overload mode. This, if you're unfamiliar, is a 6v6 objective mode in which each team attempts to secure the overload device and get it to one of the oppositions two zones. Success earns the victors one point and eight points equates to a win.
</p>
<p>
Next up, Zombies mode and its round-based Ashes of the Damned map. Inspired by the legend of the Bermuda Triangle, it's constructed from landmarks - all with a violent history - dragged into the Dark Ether. There's a ruined version Janus Towers Plaza, for instance; Black Water Cabin, where a famed horror director drowned his leading lady; Vandorn Farm, home to a murderous family and their unfortunate victims, plus the fractured Southern Georgia town of Ashwood. Between them lie endless waves of respawning undead, including the loot-snatching Ravagers. That's where your trusty wonder vehicle Tessie comes in though, providing an essential means of transporation that can be augmented with thrusters, chomp attacks, and more.
</p>
<p>
There's a closer look at Ashes of the Damned above, and if you like the sound of Vandorn Farm, it's playable as a Survival map in the imminent beta. More survival locations taken from round-based maps are promised post-launch.

<p>
Zombies mode also got a nod as Black Ops 7's showcase turned its attention to Warzone. That's thanks to Warzone's new Resurgence map, Haven's Hollow - a small Appalachian town that might look familiar to Zombies fans. It's essentially a pre-outbreak version of Liberty Falls, featuring nine unique points of interest across its autumnal expanse. There's the train station, mansion, lumber mill, riverboat, pond, coal depot, homestead, and Main Street, all of which appear in the flythrough above. And if that's got you ready to go, Haven's Hollow arrives with Season 1 later this year.
</p><p>
You'll need to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX3kSg2np68">delve into the full several-hours-long showcase</a> if you want to properly scrutinise Activision's extensive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 gameplay. As a reminder, open beta early access begins this Thursday, 2nd October, and the full game launches on 14th November.

Tatsuki Fujimoto’s manga magnum opus doesn’t just echo scripture—it shreds it up, duct-tapes it back together, and creates a new theology in its wake that’s equal parts unhinged and mirthful.</p><p>With anime <a href="https://gizmodo.com/chainsaw-man-recap-movie-reze-arc-release-date-chainsaw-days-2000648288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV episode compilations</a> dropping on Crunchyroll to prep fans for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-chainsaw-man-movie-is-hitting-theaters-even-earlier-than-expected-2000658282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc</em></a>, I’ve been deep in the trenches rereading the manga, looping its <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nszyFgNx1NresQcnH_P8qL7DoWhe0j1pg&amp;si=dhfqTIv82vYzQnV3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original soundtrack</a>, and bracing myself for a cinematic gut-punch. While the anime is still adapting the first part of the story—dubbed Part One by fans—week by week, new chapters of Part Two are dropping on Shonen Jump. If my partner gently cupping my face mid-sleep, covering my mouth to muffle my spoiler-laced snore-ramblings about what happens to Denji is any indication, fans and unsuspected moviegoers alike are all about to be emotionally obliterated by <em>Reze Arc.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re somehow still skeptical about <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s quality, dear reader, I’m here to spread the good word. Allow me to count the ways.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Light spoilers for </strong><strong><em>Chainsaw Man</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB_J6Egi28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol><li><span>Short read</span></li></ol><p>When’s the last time you ran into someone who said they read the Bible cover to cover? If you have, chances are they’re either lying—we know the Bible is best used as a prop for cherry-picked quotes brandished with overhighlighted pen marks—or they’re actually about it, bout it. Still, clocking in at 1,200 pages (depending on which of the many versions exists of it), it’d take somewhere upwards of 50 to 70 hours to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chainsaw Man</em> does not share this problem. Each chapter on Mangaplus is riddled with copycat comedians, remarking that it was a good 12-second read. And straight up, <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is a pretty quick read, balancing punchy back-and-forth dialogue and exposition between characters fortunate enough to have survived the rapture that is popularity poles. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that the manga has…</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB_J6Egi28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="2"><li><span>Drawings</span></li></ol><p>Sure, <em>Chainsaw Man</em>’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shineyezehuhh.bsky.social/post/3liaxgu3g3k2v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">art style has changed ever so slightly</a> over the course of Part One and Part Two on account of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto’s assistants</a> (read:disciples) going on to make manga of their own, like little-known works like <em>Dandadan</em>, <em>Spy x Family</em>,<em> Hell’s Paradise</em>, and <em>Centuria</em>. Still, that hasn’t stopped <em>Chainsaw Man</em> from having some of the most provocative manga panel spreads in the industry right now. From an infinite corridor of doors leading to hell to that one panel of dismembered astronauts lined up like a row of flowers praying to the devil, this manga is guaranteed to provide shock and awe with its money shot pages and sidesplitting comedy and horror with its minimalistic, repetitive panel work to set a breezier mood to lead up to those shocking revelations. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that Mappa has been going whole hog in adapting the manga, making the viewing experience feel <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2022-11-18/the-chainsaw-man-anime-style-feels-off/.191720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more like watching a film than a typical anime</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let’s compare that to the Bible’s illustrations. Wait, hold up… it doesn’t have any. Unless you count <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10172724/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VeggieTales' Larry-Boy movie</a>, <a href="https://www.theactionbible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Action Bible</a>, or those <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7967302/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meekly released animated films that go straight to DVD</a>, the Bible is lacking in visual imagery on the animated front. If anything, the good word is still being carried today by efforts like <em>The</em> <em>Prince of Egypt</em>, which remains a revered animated film regardless of whether you’re religious. And no, art museums and tapestries in the Sistine Chapel don’t count. If you can’t immediately experience its artwork without planning an expensive trip to the Vatican or freaking out your local church by gawking at its stained glass artwork, we don’t count those.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPB_J6Egi28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="3"><li><span>You can actually identify the author</span></li></ol><p>The Bible doesn’t have one set author. No part of it mentions The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit as its scribe. For thousands of years, only the most learned theologians could identify various authors, including those such as Moses, David, Solomon, Paul, and the gospel writers Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Still, there’s contention to this day on how much each scribe contributed to what is essentially an anthology, part historical, part self-help, and if any of its authors’ contributions were overstated. There’s even been a <a href="https://www.history.com/articles/who-wrote-the-bible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-author theory</a> that prevailed concerning the Old Testament in religious circles that I can’t even fathom as a lapsed Lutheran. Now, consider Tatsuki Fujimoto, a name I have just mentioned and identified as the creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>. Badabing badaboom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Funnily enough, Fujimoto had a crisis of proving his identity when his Twitter account—which he used to roleplay as a little sister he doesn’t have (<a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2022/11/11/chainsaw-man-creator-tatsuki-fujimoto-officially-joins-twitter-after-his-little-sisters-account-gets-banned?srsltid=AfmBOorh9k1SiPlyIKIdT7aMU_tpy18TLjoAiA7DzAth5UGkUDnkkrPy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we don’t have to get into it</a>) was <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-mangaka-tatsuki-fujimoto-twitter-account-1849793349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily banned for age verification reasons and fraud</a>. This, in turn, led him to have to prove his identity by providing early draft sketches of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> characters in tandem with <a href="https://x.com/SHIHEILIN/status/1590854706804719616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his editor</a>, who pleaded with the then-existent moderators on Twitter to verify his identity. Not precisely a Moses and the burning bush situation, but a dumber modern-day version of it, for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="4"><li><span><em>Chainsaw Man</em> Parts One and Two are equally cruel, unlike the Old and New Testaments</span></li></ol><p>Old Testament Bible stories have a reputation for being crueller than Jesus-era New Testament tales. And for good reason, fathers were asked to kill their kids to prove their faith, men were locked in pits with lions (also to demonstrate their faith), and leaders like Moses were exiled from the Promised Land on account of bleeding water from a rock to shut up nagging followers wondering, “Are we there yet?” Lotta faith proving ultimatums in the Bible.&nbsp;</p><p>Side bar, no one talks about the end of Moses’ tale as often as the setup, and I’ve always found it fucked up that his impatience at being a chaperone basically pulling up to McDonald's to shut up the kiddos got his shepherding privileges revoked.&nbsp;</p><p>Old Testament God was kind of an asshole, and New Testament God was less wild with his only big thing being sacrificing his own son for our sins for three days like that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5Fj_h0ou90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob jail bit</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Chainsaw Man</em> Part Two is just as fucked up as its first part. Cute anthropomorphic animals, kids, and bystanders get got, and any semblance of being a core cast member doesn’t protect folks from getting put on an airbrushed shirt either. And with Fujimoto bringing out a<a href="https://www.shonenjump.com/p/sp/2509/vote_chainsaw3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> popularity poll</a>—a fan event meant to <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Popularity_Polls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrate favorite characters</a> he’s infamously used as a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChainsawMan/comments/1nj5w2m/dont_fall_for_the_popularity_voting_fujimoto_will/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“to kill” list</a> in the past—it’s not showing any sign of slowing down on the cruelty front.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="5"><li><span>Polytheism FTW</span></li></ol><p>By far, one of the coolest aspects of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is that it’s essentially a revival of the polytheism of old, which modern-day Christianity has relegated to the past as an archaic concept. Roman and Greek idols, which represented concepts that people prayed for as blessings, are turned on their head as <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Devil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devils</a> and <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Fiend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fiends</a>, the physical manifestations of concepts made powerful in relation to humanity’s fear of them. Reading about how Denji and the gang handle devils like Eternity, Typhoon, Falling, Bomb, and War Devils is just one of the many inventive ways <em>Chainsaw Man</em> approaches modern-day polytheism as a narrative foothold for its story and how humanity can overcome those fears, whether primordial or innocuous, through its heroes.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="6"><li><span>Dog Is God (kind of)</span></li></ol><p>The story of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is actually as close an analogue to The Holy Trinity in the Bible. Denji grew up with his pet, the chainsaw puppy <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Pochita" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pochita</a>. When they died, Pochita gave up its body, becoming Denji’s heart and transforming him into Chainsaw Man, so that he could witness him fulfill his dreams. It’s very Holy Trinity-coded, but it's especially Christ-like when you consider Chainsaw Man’s motion within the story.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with Devils and Fiends, Chainsaw Man is lauded as the most fearsome of all. While Chainsaw Man, being a defender of humanity, makes him as breathless as a hero like Jesus, like any other shonen hero, it’s his reputation among devils that feels the most akin to Christianity. You see, any Devil felled by Chainsaw Man and sequentially consumed by him is erased from the world and the minds of humanity. That’s right, instead of taking away sins, Chainsaw Man takes away concepts humanity fears.&nbsp;</p><p>The manga has showcased what this looks like in action by having concepts like ears removed from the world and mingling for those who have aftiphobia, as well as bigger tentpole fears like Nazis, World War II, nuclear weapons, and AIDS from humanity. Chainsaw Man is worshipped and feared for this power, and that’s kinda radder than what Christianity has with the weaponized placebo of thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="7"><li><span>Is actually about gun control</span></li></ol><p>While the real world often weaponizes things like The Bible and Amendments as excuses for persecuting marginalized folks and ignoring policies that could otherwise better humanity, the main thrust of <em>Chainsaw Man</em> is pretty much about a topic America is too gun-shy to address whenever tragedy strikes: Gun control. Denji’s mission in Part One is to collect bullet fragments to eventually face off against the <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Gun_Devil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gun Devil</a>, who mysteriously disappeared. Still, it has been gaining power from folks' fear of it after wiping out a massive swath of humanity with one devastating blast. That’s as prescient as a hero’s journey can go.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="8"><li><span>Denji is basically Samson, the oddest character in the Bible, but with chainsaws for arms</span></li></ol><p>While it would be easy to say that Denji is basically Naruto Jesus about my sixth point, I’d reckon Denji is the closest thing manga has gotten to adapting the tale of Samson. Samson, one of my favorite tales in the Bible, is notable for its out-of-place feel in relation to the rest of the tales, as it follows a man who’s super strong and fights for God. All God asks of him is to swear off alcohol, touching dead bodies, and cutting his hair. That last point is crucial since his hair is the source of his strength. Samson went around killing lions with his bare hands, defeating Philistines using the jawbone of a donkey, and carrying the Gates of Gaza on his shoulders for miles on some comic book character shit.&nbsp;</p><p>To counteract Samson, the Philistines sent out a woman named Delilah, whom Samson fell head over heels for, to uncover the source of his strength. After several trysts where he lied about his strength, he finally told her about his hair, and she betrayed him,&nbsp; leading to his capture, blinding, and imprisonment. In a last-ditch effort, Samson prayed to God, leading to his hair growing back and him pulling down the pillars of a temple, killing himself and thousands of Philistines who imprisoned him.&nbsp;</p><p>Reader, if that isn’t Denji and Makima’s whole relationship, replacing hair growth with his heart, then I don’t know what is. It also doesn’t hurt that the story of Samson’s themes are about squandered potential, diving purpose, and sacrifice. That aligns nicely with Denji slowly figuring out his Maslow’s hierarchy of needs throughout the series as he grapples with his humanity and the fame that comes with being a hero.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuF7zWmVlgs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump </a></figcaption></figure><ol start="9"><li><span>Cringe girls doing girl-failure things representation</span></li></ol><p>The Bible, for all its divine drama, is kind of a boys’ club where women rarely get the spotlight unless they’re birthing messiahs. Sure, there’s Mother Mary and Esther (forever immortalized as a <a href="https://veggietales-the-ultimate-veggiepedia.fandom.com/wiki/Esther" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">green onion in <em>VeggieTales</em></a>), but the canon’s pretty thin on women doing rad, messy, morally ambiguous stuff that feels genuinely human. <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, on the other hand, is overflowing with female characters who aren’t sanitized paragons. They’re chaotic, vain, vulnerable, and painfully relatable—case in point: <a href="https://chainsaw-man.fandom.com/wiki/Asa_Mitaka" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asa Mitaka</a>, the deuteragonist of Part Two.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Denji, Asa fulfills gendered tropes—she’s awkward, selfish, and thirsting for romantic validation in ways that are both cringe and cathartic. <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-asa-female-incel-shonen-jump-manga-1850208738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Sisi Jiang points out</a>, her inner monologue is a masterclass in emotional dissonance. She wants love but refuses to look like she’s begging for it. She also has no issue with others sacrificing themselves for her but finds it hard to cope with the guilt of feeling like she could do more to save others. In a genre where women are often relegated to being shy support beams in a male-centric trio, <em>Chainsaw Man</em> gives them the spotlight and a majority of the series’ big hero moments. They’re not just reflections of virtue, but mirrors to our messiest selves, and that’s rad.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://youtu.be/zZniAuAzeG8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shonen Jump</a></figcaption></figure><ol start="10"><li><span>Hates America&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p>In a series rife with reality-altering devils and fiends, whenever the U.S. government is mentioned, it carries a presence like a shadowly, manipulative force responsible for undignified deaths far more brutal than its fantastical villains. The key difference in their menace is that Devils and fiends are disorganized in their terror, almost downright random, like encountering an animal in the wild. America is a fear-fueled machine and a huge component of why the Gun Devil is such a huge problem. The Gun Devil, in a way, is a literal embodiment of mass violence and national trauma that America has played a significant part in on a global scale. Plus, all you have to do to get a vibe check on Fujimoto’s thoughts on America is to check out his drawing of Captain America.&nbsp;</p><p>Hell, the series recently revealed that the War Devil loves America because it reverse-engineered nuclear weapons despite being a concept Chainsaw Man erased from the world. Not every day a modern-day theocratic-leaning work displayed its politics bare for the world to enjoy on a weekly comic book basis, but not everything can be <em>Chainsaw Man</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone"><h3>The EA Sale Is Bad News For Everyone</h3></a><p>Except--you'll never believe it--the guys who already have the money</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/chainsaw-man-reze-arc-tatsuki-fujimoto-the-bible]]></content:encoded>

                <p>We're getting a blast from the past when a future major Call of Duty: Warzone update drops in Spring 2026. "A bold new experience" will come to the battle royale, inspired by the Black Ops 4 battle royale mode, Blackout.</p><p>"Call of Duty: Warzone is bringing a bold new experience in Spring of 2026 inspired by the original Blackout, set on Avalon," reads a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post </a>from the official Call of Duty X account.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 was the first Call of Duty game to feature a battle royale mode. Launching after the battle royale boom in 2017, Blackout had 100 players drop onto a gigantic map to fight for their lives until only one player or team was left standing.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Black Ops 4's battle royale map, Avalon, will also be returning. It featured fan-favorite named locations like Nuketown Island, as well as more generic locales like a train station and construction site. Avalon has changed several times over the years, and we don't know how it might change for this 2026 release, so none of the locations from the original map are guaranteed to return. While Avalon is positively viewed by many in the Warzone community, Verdansk and other Warzone maps are often viewed more favorably.</p><p>Warzone is also getting a new <a href="https://resurgence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resurgence </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-adding-new-resurgence-map-but-verdansk-isnt-going-anywhere/1100-6535109/" data-ref-id="1100-6535109">map</a> alongside Black Ops 7.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/today-is-the-last-day-to-redeem-microsoft-rewards-points-for-xbox-game-pass-subscriptions.1312942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starting tomorrow, October 1, 2025, you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points towards Xbox Game Pass subscriptions, which means today, September 30, 2025, is the last day you'll be able to redeem any Microsoft Rewards points you may have towards Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3m22wu2q4st2f">first spotted by Wario64</a>, who shared the statement from Microsoft announcing that you'll no longer be able to redeem Microsoft Rewards points for Xbox Game Pass. That said, there is still a way to get Xbox Game Pass through redeeming Microsoft Rewards points; you'll have to use your Rewards points towards redeeming an Xbox gift card.</p>



<p>As Wario64 points out, that means if you want to use your points to get even just one month of Game Pass, you'll need 6,000 more points than you would have if you could still redeem them directly for a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<p>It's the latest change to the Rewards Points system, and one that hasn't been met with favour from those who actively use the system. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1nuhtri/microsoft_rewards_starting_october_1st_users_will/">quick scroll through the Xbox Reddit page regarding the news</a> shows users are not happy that they'll need to spend thousands more points than before. </p>



<p>In other Game Pass news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-making-largest-investment-in-game-pass-to-date-xbox-game-pass/">Microsoft and Xbox are reportedly putting more behind the subscription service than ever before in 2025</a>, while former Microsoft and Bethesda executive Pete Hines says that <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">subscription services like Game Pass don't properly reward the developers and studios making the content that fills the services</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>David Arquette, actor,<em> Scream 3</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is to the gaming world what the computer was to the typewriter. It’s not just an entertainment luxury, but a necessity.”</p> <h2>Hayden Christensen, actor, <em>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em></h2> <p>“I just got [PlayStation 2] a few days ago, but I’ve been playing it non-stop; it’s a great system. The graphics are fantastic, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”</p>

 <h2>Luke Wilson, actor, <em>Charlie’s Angels</em></h2> <p>“Freedom from everyday life can only mean one thing – the arrival of PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Sandra Bullock, actress, <em>Miss Congeniality</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the only place where I can legally explode things and not harm anyone.”</p>

 <h2>Chris Klein, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve been playing game systems for a really long time, but once you go PlayStation 2 you can never go back. . .It’s the best system for sure.”</p> <h2>Jason Biggs, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I do play PlayStation. I have a PS2 console and it is awesome…It is amazing. PS one is still great, but the graphics and the concepts on PS2 are incredibly realistic…I had PS2 in my trailer for <em>American Pie II</em>. Me and the rest of the guys would get into some heated games.”</p>

 <h2>Jason Lee, actor, <em>Almost Famous</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is the most amazing game I’ve ever played. Amazing graphics, too. The console looks like it’s straight out of <em>Blade Runner</em>!”</p> <h2>Justin Timberlake, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I play PlayStation 2 all the time, not just on the road. The play action is really easy and has the best graphics.”</p>

 <h2>P. Diddy, rapper</h2> <p>“No doubt I am a [PlayStation 2] fan. My kids and I play together.”</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg, rapper/actor, <em>The Wash</em></h2> <p>“The rush to get the new PlayStation 2 is more out of control than the Cabbage Patch Kids. I want my music on there – I want it to be Snoop Dogg and PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Nick Carter, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“I’ve been playing PlayStation 2 since it came out. I take it out on tour and play on the bus, in my hotel room and backstage before the shows. The graphics are totally awesome, and I like that I can use it to play DVDs, too.”</p> <h2>Vin Diesel, actor,<em> The Fast &amp; The Furious</em></h2> <p>“If I’m not playing Sony PlayStation or rereading a classic or watching a foreign film. . .my friends and I get on the Internet and find out who I’m dating, and it’s always hysterical.”</p>

 <h2>Tara Reid, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation is fun. It’s innocent and fun. It is nice to be kids and have a good time… I bring PlayStation 2 into my trailer on every movie I do.”</p> <h2>John Leguizamo, actor, <em>Moulin Rouge</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the coolest thing ever. Forget my kids, this is MINE!”</p> <h2>Wayne Brady, comedian/actor, <em>Whose Line Is it Anyway?</em></h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2. I’m all over my PS2. . . I tour so much now doing my improv act, that it’s great because my wife doesn’t let me play games at home, so I play them in the hotel room.”</p>

 <h2>Seann William Scott, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. . . I’ve played other games before but PlayStation 2 is just amazing.”</p> <h2>Shannon Elizabeth, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is the best thing ever.”</p> <h2>Tom Green, actor, <em>The Tom Green Show</em></h2> <p>“They’ve all got Sony PlayStations and I don’t.” (On what he most values in his friends) “FINALLY, I’ve got my very own PS2″</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon, actor, <em>Saturday Night Live</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is sweet! The new Madden game sounds insane…I want to play it now. I’m also excited about playing over the Internet. If they make an Olympic game it will be awesome to actually play someone in China. Too much fun.”</p> <h2>Forest Whitaker, actor/director, <em>Waiting To Exhale</em></h2> <p>“I can’t wait to get the PlayStation 2 for my kids. They’re going to love it.”</p>

 <h2>Ashley Angel, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“It’s midnight in Milwaukee and it’s 20 degrees outside and instead of being in a warm hotel room, Jacob, Erik and I are out playing PS2 in the tour bus.”</p> <h2>Howie Dorough, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“We are all fans, but Nikki [Nick Carter] is the biggest. That is why I can’t beat him at <em>Who </em><em>Wants to Be a Millionaire</em> – I am trying to get that thing down.”</p> <h2>Dave Matthews, singer, Dave Mathews Band</h2> <p>“The band is so into PlayStation 2. I can’t imagine being on the road without it. Our lounge on the bus is dedicated to PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Danny Masterson, actor, <em>That 70’s Show</em></h2> <p>“The games are really cool – they’ve got good soundtracks on them and look very, very real…I’m at work and in between scenes we play video games. We should probably read more books, but PlayStation 2 is so darn good.”</p> <h2>Bill Bellamy, MTV VJ/actor,<em> The Brothers</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is fascinating to see. The graphics are so incredible, so lifelike — it’s fast, it’s fun, it’s challenging, it brings people together. You feel like you’re really in the game. That’s the part that’s cool and that’s what people get excited about.”</p>

 <h2>Patricia Arquette, actress, <em>Little Nicky</em></h2> <p>“We can’t get enough of PlayStation 2 at our house.”</p> <h2>Lee Ann Rimes, singer</h2> <p>“It’s a total stress-buster at the end of a long day – it’s a lot of fun!”</p> <h2>Marlon Wayans, actor/writer, <em>Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“It’s the truth. I played John Madden. . .one sack hit me so big, it broke my rib. You really feel like you’re playing the game. It’s the true experience. . .PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, actress,<em> X-Men</em></h2> <p>“When I saw my friend [playing PlayStation 2] I became determined to become as much of an expert as she is.”</p>

 <h2>Tom Arnold, actor, <em>Best Damn Sports Show Period, True Lies</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is so intense that when they play they don’t want to talk to anyone around them.”</p> <h2>Jermaine Dupri, So So Def Founder/Producer/ Recording Artist</h2> <p>“I am a die hard PlayStation 2 fan, I don’t like nothing else. But PlayStation is my favorite. . .You can play music, games, DVDs – there isn’t anything better.”</p> <h2>Billy Campbell, actor, <em>Once and Again</em></h2> <p>“It’s going to be a long time before anybody beats it…”</p> <h2>Brendan Fehr, actor, <em>Roswell</em></h2> <p>“In terms of graphics, it’s far superior to [the original] PlayStation. In between scenes, you see the players come out of dressing rooms, and there are little clips like you’re watching TV. It’s a lot of fun. . . PlayStation 2 is great because it plays both DVDs and games. . . and the graphics are so cool.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day. PS2 is the BOMB!”</p> <h2>Joshua Jackson, actor, <em>Dawson ’s Creek</em></h2> <p>“I can’t go to a [movie] set without my PlayStation 2 ”</p> <h2>Sean Stockton, singer, Boyz II Men</h2> <p>“I am a huge fan of [PlayStation 2’s] <em>Grand Theft Auto.</em> . . for adults like me it is the bomb.”</p> <h2>Donald Faison, actor, <em>Scrubs</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is everywhere – they’re always at the most happening spots. It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan. I can’t wait for <em>Tony Hawk 3</em> to come out…I play <em>Madden</em> all day long.”</p> <h2>Bryan McFayden, MTV VJ</h2> <p>“At MTV, a PlayStation 2 is never more than 30 feet away from where we’re taping.”</p> <h2>Erik-Michael Estrada, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“<em>NCAA Gamebreaker 2001</em> for PS2 is the most incredible college football game ever. Since we’ve gotten the PS2 on the road we have not been getting any sleep on the bus.”</p> <h2>Jason Cerbone, actor, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I have a PlayStation 2 at home and play all the time. I am a big fan.”</p> <h2>Jeff Timmons, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“We’re going to test out all of the games for Sony and post our recommendations on our website.”</p> <h2>Justin Jaffe, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is going to take over our football lounge on the bus.”</p> <h2>Kevin Richardson, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2’s <em>Madden 2002</em>, I am addicted to that game. I am addicted to football and loved to play in high school, but was not good enough to play college or professional ball. With <em>Madden</em>, I get to live out my fantasies on PlayStation 2.”</p>

 <h2>Lance Bass, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2 because it helps me to get rid of stress on and off the road.”</p> <h2>Michael Rosenbaum, actor, <em>Smallville</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is more fun than my blow-up doll.”</p> <h2>Nick Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I know we’re going to bum through the first PlayStation 2 unit on the first leg of the tour.”</p> <h2>Robert Horry, athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I went to the launch party last season and it was the best party I went to and I had to come back and check out the anniversary party. I don’t play the basketball games because I get frustrated. The games won’t let me do moves that I know I can do in real life.”</p> <h2>John Salley, former athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“My daughter and I compete [on PlayStation 2]. Whenever we get in a fight, we say ‘See you on PlayStation.’ It’s better than a spanking. Just spank them on PlayStation.”</p> <h2>Simon Rex, actor, <em>Jack and Jill </em>(2002 TV show)</h2> <p>“Incredible fast graphics that would make Mario run for the hills. If my friends thought I spent a lot of time on PlayStation, just wait until [PlayStation 2] comes out!”</p>

 <h2>Stefan Lessard, bassist, Dave Matthews Band</h2> <p>“People know when they can’t find me, I’m in my bunk playing PlayStation 2. It’s my saving grace on the road – but I love playing it at home too!”</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel, host, <em>The Man Show</em></h2> <p>“My son is eight years old and is hooked up like an IV to the PlayStation 2 — it keeps him busy.”</p> <h2>Adrien Brody, actor, <em>Dummy</em></h2> <p>“I don’t even have a TV, but I’m going to get one and go crazy with PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Vincent Pastore, actor, A<em>fter the Storm</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I am into it.”</p> <h2>Tia Carrere, actress, <em>Wayne’s World</em></h2> <p>“Actually, I have to admit to jumping to the head of the line in Canada to get a couple of PlayStation 2s for Christmas — I was part of the craze. Now I want one for me.”</p> <h2>Nick Stahl, actor, <em>The </em><em>Thin Red Line</em></h2> <p>“The PS2’s graphics are amazing. I can’t wait to own one of these. . .I’ll play it all the time.”</p> <h2>Norman Reedus, actor/model,<em> Gossip</em></h2> <p>“I love playing the PlayStation 2. It’s like meditation.”</p> <h2>Vincent Young, actor</h2> <p>“The sports games are addictive. I can’t put <em>Madden Football</em> down once I start playing. The graphics are so realistic – you can even see the hair on the players’ arms move.”</p> <h2>Catherine Bell, actress,<em> Jag</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is amazing and it looks really cool. Plus, the graphics are incredible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a Yakuza fan, I’ve recommended the series from Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, otherwise known as RGG, to plenty of people, but it has long come with one big caveat: Yakuza 3. It’s not that there is anything necessarily wrong with it, but with high-quality remakes of the first games in the series, and the more modern and refined graphics and gameplay of the newer entries, it has stood out a bit as a bit of an odd duck, looking and playing worse than the games before and after. However, with the just-announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rgg-studio-direct-2025-confirms-yakuza-kiwami-3-remake-spinoff-dark-ties-and-more-heres-everything-announced"><u>Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties</u></a>, a twin pack combining a remade Yakuza 3 alongside a brand-new companion game, that might all be about to change. I had a chance to play both at Tokyo Game Show 2025, and I came away impressed by how much RGG Studio is trying to improve and expand on the original. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Yakuza Kiwami 3</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza Kiwami 3 isn’t just an up-rezzed port; it’s a full remake. Everything is rebuilt, from the graphics to the combat to the new cut scenes and voice acting – including some modern motion capture to better bring the characters to life. While it will still follow the story of Yakuza 3, some scenes will play out differently or expand. It’s an ambitious agenda, but probably the right one to bring the now 16-year-old game to modern audiences. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My hands-on begins with Kazuma Kiryu chopping wood outside the Morning Glory Orphanage, where he was raised and now runs, in Okinawa. The modern graphics look great as he swings his axe, his sweat glistening in crisp 4K (for those that are into that sort of thing). After the events of Yakuza 2, he’s moved on from being a Yakuza and is trying to live a peaceful life running the orphanage. An eviction notice arrives, and Kiryu heads into town to confront the head of the Ryudo family, the owners of the land on which the orphanage is built. He runs into Rikiya Shimabukuro, a member of the Ryudo clan and, naturally, a brawl ensues, giving us our first taste of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-official-combat-gameplay-trailer"><u>updated battle system</u></a>. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s head never gets old.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiriyu has two fighting styles to employ. The first is Dragon of Dojima, his classic brawling style, mixing punches, kicks, throws, and environmental weapons like street signs, traffic cones, and even the odd bicycle when the opportunity presents itself. It’s as flashy as ever, and charging Kiriyu’s Heat Gauge to execute brutal finishers like smashing a chair on an opponent’s (in this case, Rikiya’s) head never gets old. The real magic comes when I switch to his brand new Ryukyu style, however. This style is rooted in Okinawan culture, and while using it, Kiryu combos through eight different weapons, like a pair of tonfa, a weighted chain, or, my personal favorite, a boat oar. I put away my opponent with a mix of all of the above, which was enough to convince Rikiya to direct me towards where to find his boss. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This opened up an opportunity for a bit of open-world exploration, which I took full advantage of, exploring a nearby street market, beating up some ruffians with a crowbar, and taking in a quick round of a golf mini-game. Okinawa looks great on the modern engine, and getting around was a breeze thanks to the new Street Surfer Mk. 0, a Segway-like rideable that Kiryu seems to be able to summon out of thin air for some quick joyriding. Zooming around on that, hopping off to beat the snot out of some goons with my tiny shield (also part of the Ryukyu set), then making a speedy getaway was so Yakuza in the best way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I turned my attention back to the main story. As Rikiya escorts me to his headquarters, we are interrupted by a commotion as a rival family trashes a local market, taking the shop owner hostage. Kiriyu, sweet guy that he is, agrees to help, leading to a massive nine-vs-two melee, as he and Rikiya take on the boss and his lackeys. This really showcased how much more refined the combat is, as I was able to take advantage of the smooth movement and dodging, creating windows to bash the bad guys and escape, with a slick double-team KO of one poor crony eating a massive kick to the face from Kiryi while restrained by Rikiya. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My time in Yakuza Kiwami 3 ended there, but I barely scratched the surface of everything new coming to it. There will be more personal moments with supporting characters, time dedicated to running the daily operations at the orphanage and taking care of the kids, even a new team battle mode where you build your own biker gang to fight for turf with others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dark Ties</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bigger surprise of the Yakuza Kiwami 3 announcement was the reveal of Dark Ties, an all-new companion story to the main game.  This places you in the role of Yoshitaka Mine, the antagonist of Yakuza 3. Dark Ties covers Mine’s rise from a disgraced businessman, driven from his own tech startup, to the underworld boss that acts as Kazuma’s foil in Yakuza 3. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-a0751c8f4adedccafc6ce8de3d09f3147e1c1ff7-1920x1080-1759256313741.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">His story begins with Mine reflecting on his life and the loneliness that drove him to pursue wealth and influence. By happenstance, he witnesses a deadly fight between rival Yakuza families, and seeing the bond of men willing to die for their boss, Daigo Dojima, acts as a catalyst, and he sets out to see if he can find that same loyalty in the criminal underworld. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo takes place early in the game, with Mine tracking down Tsuyoshi Kanda, an infamous Yakuza just released from prison. Mine hopes Kanda will be his entry point to begin his own rise, though as is Yakuza tradition, you don’t go more than a few early steps before some punks decide to pick a fight. Apparently, Mine's suitcase looks expensive, and they want whatever is inside. A bad decision. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-ba732b95bcacaf8be1e93757deb185452b404294-1920x1080-1759256328386.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists. Mine’s fighting style is very different from Kiryu’s, relying heavily on quick boxing combos, technical wrestling moves, and new aerial attacks. He can jump and plant a foot on the chest of one enemy, then leap to another, dishing out damage all around as he delivers an array of flying moves, like springboard jump kicks or mid-air tackles. They look very cool, and make for a fun bit of planning ahead as you scope out which enemies to latch onto and jump towards. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The core battle system is roughly the same as Yakuza 3, but with a few significant twists.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the standard Heat Gauge that fills up to enable special moves, Mine has three chained hearts that fill up as he lands attacks. Once at least one is full, he can activate a powerful buffed mode called Dark Awakening. This functions like a new fighting style, with a different moveset unleashing extremely powerful attacks.  More than one chained heart can be activated at once, increasing the potency of Dark Awakening. It’s a neat twist to make Mine’s gameplay more distinct, and tapping into the rage behind his calm exterior fits his character well. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-9cba6bf65a0beef3fe9d84599989fa573efcdfb4-1920x1080-1759256341008.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It quickly became clear these punks picked the wrong suitcase to try to snatch, as I knocked them senseless to the cheers of onlookers who witnessed the attempted robbery. With the ruffians handled, I’m given the option to head to the prison to track down Kanda or kill some time exploring the city. This sorry mission seems important, so naturally I… immediately go find a karaoke bar to sing a song. Hey, it is Yakuza after all. I rent the room, and Mine pours his heart and soul into his solo performance, which is really funny given his normally extremely stoic nature. I nail rhythm on my button presses, delivering a perfect performance befitting a man of Mine’s talents. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Buoyed by my outstanding singing, I decide it’s time to get down to business and try to hail a cab to the prison where Kanda is being released. One more group of punks tries to stop me (nothing a fireman’s carry followed by a quick kick to the face couldn’t solve), and I find myself outside of the prison as Kanda takes out his frustration on his paltry, two-man welcoming committee. Kanda is penniless, his branch of the Yakuza family disgraced. As Mine tails him through the streets of Kamurocho, my hands-on time ends just as he rounds a corner to meet his future right-hand man for the first time. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/30/ss-f6d5496302d2de4c46d55e782221f7e6f0f03ffb-1920x1080-1759256356109.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As a sucker for a good organized crime story, I’m definitely intrigued to see how much we get to witness Mine channel his inner Vito Corleone and build his criminal empire from the ground up, especially if it means some proper bromance time with Mine and Diago. The fact that it comes as part of the package with Yakuza Kiwami 3 is great, and I’m excited to see how it all turns out when Yakuza Kiwami 3 and Dark Ties release on February 12, 2026. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-bring-much-needed-combat-and-visual-upgrades]]></content:encoded>

                <p>No one likes waiting, especially when there's nothing to do to pass the time. Peak developer Landfall Games had that same thought when working on Peak's most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/520850995978175752" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DillyDally update</a>.

"Used all the chess pieces and bing bong. That's a queen and a few pawns above the rafters"</p><p>The update released last week, and social media was flooded with chess pieces stacked ceiling-high in the airport lobby over the weekend. Peak's physics system, which can lead to some quirky antics on climbs, turned out to be perfect for some extracurricular activities for the scouts.</p><p>Peak lobbies are set in airport waiting areas, as the game begins with a playful loading-screen plane crash that sets you and your friends off on your journey to summit a procedurally generated mountain. The climb is almost never easy, so it makes sense that scouts should have some fun while waiting in the terminal.</p><p>Landfall Games and publisher Aggro Crab have released a few updates since Peak became a massive hit when it launched in June. A new biome, the Mesa--complete with tornadoes, scorching heat, and scorpions--was added in August. Another biome has also been teased, but no confirmed details have been shared yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In my article about the $55 billion EA buyout deal</a>, I singled out BioWare as the likely target of potential layoffs following the closure. Indeed, later today, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming posted an article</a> citing inside sources from the Canadian studio, revealing that the employees are already worried about this sudden transition.</p>



<p>Two of the anonymous sources allegedly said:</p>



<p><em>Look at the negativity that came after Dragon Age. If we felt it was only going to get worse then, you can imagine what some of us think now.</em></p>



<p><em>I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs. Kind of feels like a matter of time.</em></p>



<p>The reference is to last year's launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the studio's first new game since the massive failure of Anthem. Unfortunately, despite a fairly positive critical reception, the game did not sell nearly as well as publisher Electronic Arts had hoped (the goal was to hit 3 million players, but in January 2025, EA said Veilguard had only 'engaged' 1.5 million players), <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-now-has-less-than-100-developers-as-ea-permanently-shifts-people-to-other-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leading to layoffs that brought the studio headcount to less than a hundred</a>. </p>



<p>BioWare is now focused on making the next Mass Effect game, but will they even get the chance? For now, the sentiment inside the studio is simply to go ahead until they are told otherwise:</p>



<p><em>We're going to keep working until they tell us we are done. It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away.</em></p>



<p>Insider Gaming even reports having heard that there were attempts to sell off BioWare at some point, though they must have gone nowhere for the time being, as there was no such official news alongside the buyout deal.</p>



<p>Perhaps that would be the best chance for the studio that made some of the greatest Western roleplaying games of all time, such as Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age. As things stand, on one hand, Electronic Arts going private could mean slightly less pressure to deliver right away; on the other, the publisher has a lot of debt and its new owners (PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners) may want immediate cost-cutting measures to deal with it. </p>

            <p>
What if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eve-online">EVE Online</a> was a bit less sci-fi, and a lot more medieval? You would, in theory, get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pax-dei">Pax Dei</a>, a game that first entered early access in June last year. Responses to it so far appear to be, well, mixed, but as seems to be quite common with These Kinds Of Games, everyone that's played it appears to be going through some kind of Stockholm syndrome kind of situation, as the game is still going. It's going so far as to launch into 1.0 in fact, and developer Mainframe Industries have even put a date to it.
</p>
<p>
That release date is October 16th, about half a month away at the time of writing (assuming I still know how to read calendars). Mainframe outlined what you can expect in the leadup to the launch, as well as what will happen at launch itself in a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/510718530665054707?l=english">Steam news post</a> too.
</p>
<p>
From October 6th until the 14th, servers for the game will be completely offline. On the 14th, at 3am PDT, anyone that owns a founder's pack will have access to the game's 1.0 servers, and then on the 16th at 8am PDT, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> will be available to everyone. Something to note is that with the launch of 1.0, everyone that has been playing so far will have everything wiped - shards, characters, plots, inventories, skills, and more. This is the final wipe though, Mainframe explained, so you won't have to worry if you're new to the game.
</p>
<p>
One big difference is that Pax Dei will also have a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1995520/view/524223243273373577">subscription model</a>. You can just play the game by buying it, but memberships give you a whole bunch of extras that do seem a little bit unfair. In particular, depending on which membership plan you go for, you'll get a number of plot tokens, which let you literally own certain pieces of land - that you have to continuously pay for with said tokens. Yes, this is essentially digital rent. Whether this works out or not, well, we'll find out in the next few months.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda (also known as Suda51) is undoubtedly one of the most eclectic Japanese game designers, not to mention one of those whose opinions are always interesting to read. Recently, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRxQxndH7QM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he made a statement to the Future Game Show channel</a> about wanting to make a game based on the character Peacemaker. When asked which DC Comics character he'd choose if given the chance, he replied (via a translator):</p>



<p><em>Peacemaker. I'd like to see some new ways of murdering people that aren't in the show and in the comics. That's one of the things we're good at Grasshopper Manufacture: finding ways to kill s*it and making it grotty and bloody and stuff. So, yeah, I'd like to see Peacemaker find some new, interesting ways of murdering people.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, Suda51 already collaborated with James Gunn, the current co-chairman and co-CEO of DC Studios, on the 2012 action/adventure game Lollipop Chainsaw. Gunn specifically aided with designing that game's story and characters.</p>



<p>Nowadays, James Gunn is the grand architect (alongside Peter Safran) of the new DC Universe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dcu-will-connect-games-movies-and-tv-says-james-gunn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which includes games, movies, and TV</a>. Truth be told, there hasn't been anything in the gaming space related to the new DCU, but Gunn <a href="https://wccftech.com/james-gunn-excited-about-one-dc-games-in-particular-still-early-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided an update last month</a> when he said that he was excited about 'one specific thing' when it comes to DC games. He also clarified that it's still in the early stages, however.</p>



<p>Incidentally, we just published an exclusive interview with Suda51 about Grasshopper Manufacture's upcoming action/adventure game ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN. <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can read it here in its entirety</a>.</p>



<p>As for Peacemaker, the character also made our headlines because Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-removes-peacemaker-dance-emote-from-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the character-specific dance emote from their popular game Fortnite</a> after the latest plot twist seen in Episode 6 of the show's second season, currently airing on HBO Max.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/threads-time-trailer-chrono-trigger-jrpg-sea-stars-2000630296</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2-5d-love-letter-to-chrono-trigger-and-other-jrpg-classics-couldn%E2%80%99t-look-any-more-perfect.1312867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Threads of Time</em> be <a href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165">the next<em> Sea of</em> <em>Stars</em>,</a> or instead another tedious JRPG homage that emulates the classics without being able to capture what really made them tick? That was my question when it debuted during <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tgs-2024-tokyo-game-show-final-fantasy-game-pass-1851658415">last year’s Xbox Tokyo Game Show livestream</a>. But every time this indie game has resurfaced since, it’s looked better and better. It returned to TGS 2025 with yet another trailer perfectly calibrated to play on fans’ hopes and dreams for another great 16-bit homage to all-time greats like<em> Chrono Trigger</em>.</p> <p>The turn-based RPG with beautiful pixel art and an amazing 2.5D depth of field is being made by Canada-based Riyo Games and published by Humble Games. There’s a team of over 30 people working on it. We still don’t have a release date but it’s looking in better shape than some flashy projects that dazzle with trailers but fail to actually ship. I hope the team isn’t biting off more than it can chew, especially amid a tough funding environment for smaller indie developers and publishers, because everything in this trailer is exactly what I want from a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> spiritual successor:</p>

  <p>The time-travelling adventure spans millions of years, from a prehistoric past to a cyberpunk future. Turn-based combat takes place in a dynamic view with bespoke attack animations. There’s an overworld map, town hubs, and NPCs to chat up. You’ll recruit characters from different eras and unlock team combos for battle. Why are you doing all this, exactly? It sounds like you’re working for the Order of Time Knights to try and protect the integrity of the timeline or something. Also: cool boss fights.</p> <p><em>Threads of Time</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with hand-crafted 2D pixel art. I can’t stress enough how great the environments and characters look. If that can hold up over an entire 10-20 hour adventure it will be an impressive achievement, especially for the indie studio’s first project. 2023’s <em>Sea of Stars</em> was the last game to pull this trick off, selling like hotcakes and winning nods at The Game Awards that year (DLC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabotagestudio.com/post/3lpmbdqu7w22w">released earlier this year</a>). Before that, there was 2021’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/eastward-the-kotaku-review-1847753920">incredible-looking <em>Eastward</em></a>. I hope <em>Threads of Time</em> can deliver something equally special in the next year or two. It’s currently only confirmed for PC and Xbox.</p>

        <p>Late summer, 2000…</p><p>During a ritual held at a remote temple, Yuni loses consciousness, and awakens inside the cold, dark confines of a refrigerator.

                <p>As part of the Call of Duty: Next event today, Activision made a series of major announcements about the FPS franchise, including what's next for Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>To begin with, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s integration into Warzone will begin in Season 1, and this will include a brand-new Resurgence map called Haven's Hollow. This is a smaller map than Fortune's Keep but larger than Rebirth Island.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982" data-ratio="0.55223880597015" data-width="2144" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4577982"></a><figcaption>Haven's Hollow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4577982-screenshot2025-09-30at2.04.52%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The map takes place in Liberty Falls, which is the town from Black Ops 6 Zombies prior to the zombie outbreak. Given that timeline, the map doesn't include a zombies aesthetic and instead has a more vibrant color tone, along with many points of interest to explore. The map was designed and developed by High Moon Studios.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSLfZ0GiNs8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QSLfZ0GiNs8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big Warzone news from Call of Duty: Next is that Warzone's very first map, Verdansk, is remaining the main map for Warzone going forward. It's not exactly the same map as you remember it, though, as two new POIs have been added: Factory and Signal Station.</p><p>Verdansk was the OG map for Warzone when the game launched in 2020. It remained playable until 2021 when it was removed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-discusses-verdansks-return-and-feedback-so-far/1100-6530838/" data-ref-id="1100-6530838">only to come back earlier this year.</a> Its return prompted a resurgence in Warzone players, so it's no surprise to see Activision stick with it.</p><p>There are gameplay updates in Warzone coming as well, including a limit of five attachments and no Wildcards. Additionally, tactical sprint has been removed and is now only available via the Sprinter perk. The combat roll ability from Black Ops 7 is also coming to Warzone through the Mountaineer perk. Finally, there is greater ground loot coming to Warzone. All of this was confirmed by Charlie Intel.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Warzone gameplay updates:</p><p>- Weapons: 5 attachments only, no Wildcards, Overkill by default <br>- Tactical Sprint removed, now in Sprinter Perk<br>- Combat Roll from BO7 added via Mountaineer Perk <br>- Greater ground loot, including curated weapon builds <a href="https://t.co/C1WWQKT8Z7" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/C1WWQKT8Z7</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1973086382529691700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dont-starve-board-game-coming-from-glass-cannon-unplugged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em></a> has gone live. Glass Cannon Unplugged's tabletop adaptation of Klei Interactive's acclaimed survival game has been a blockbuster success, reaching its initial funding goal in five minutes and continuing to climb.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for Don't Starve: The Board Game describes the game as a cooperative roguelike experience. Much like its video game source material, 1-4 players are dropped into a land of magic, mad science, and overwhelmingly filled with cruel elements and monsters. Players will need to work together and do all they can to survive.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=CRyLRWyr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-starve-the-board-game-box-contents.jpg?itok=BXmVFos2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is broken up into three different parts. Exploring the wilderness for food, resources, biomes, and secrets. Crafting those resources into weapons, tools, structures, and devices to help you withstand the weather, the dark, and the locals. Finally, the survival element, where you have to manage your hunger, sanity, and health as you traverse the dark world.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has several early bird incentives. If you back the game within its first 72 hours, you'll get the Wolfgang expansion, which introduces the playable Wolfgang character, at no additional cost. The expansion will include an unpainted Wolfgang miniature, a holographic character card, and two ability cards.</p>

<p>In addition, each playable character in the board game has a Fortune digital skin, which can be unlocked in the video game spin-off, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-starve-together-sharing-unlocks-across-platforms-in-future-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve Together</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>For those interested in board game add-ons, the campaign includes playmats, dice towers, cardboard terrain packs, and acrylic monster standee packs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;pledge tiers for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Pledge for $79:</strong> The regular edition of the game with acrylic monster standees, any and all unlocked stretch goals, and Don't Starve Together digital character skins</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $129:</strong> Everything in the standard pledge but with unpainted miniatures for monsters and characters</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$746,128, completely decimating its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign ends October 23.</span></span></p>
