        <blockquote><p>The ground-breaking experience from legendary game creator Hideo Kojima, <em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> also features the acting and voice talents led by a star-studded cast including Norman Reedus as Sam Bridges, Mads Mikkelsen, Lea Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, and Lindsay Wagner.</p><p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut</em> challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic “Death Stranding” event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</p><p><em>Director’s Cut</em> is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While the Borderlands live-action movie was released to poor reception in August, Zelnick doesn't foresee it having a negative impact on the Borderlands game franchise ahead of its new mainline entry release. "So, I don't think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I've spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelnick said to IGN</a>.</p><p>Once again developed by Gearbox, Borderlands 4 was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> in August, although details on the game have been kept tightly locked up since then.

                <p>Seven years ago, composer Yasuaki Iwata left his mark on Nintendo history with the riveting score for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/1900-6416626/" data-ref-id="1900-6416626">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, which he co-wrote with Manaka Kataoka and Hajime Wakai. But now, Iwata has revealed that his time at Nintendo has come to an end.</p><p>In a message posted on his X account, Iwata said that he left Nintendo in July 2023. He also profusely thanked his supporters and the players who enjoyed his work at Nintendo over the years. Additionally, Iwata stated that he's been working on new projects since he left Nintendo, but he didn't elaborate on what they are.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/yasui_wata/status/1853634520362389547" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I have a bit of a belated announcement to share. <br>In July of last year, I took a step in a new direction by leaving my position at Nintendo. <br>I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported me over the years, to those who enjoyed my work, and to everyone…</p>  — Yasuaki Iwata / 岩田恭明(いわた やすあき) (@yasui_wata) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasui_wata/status/1853634520362389547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Yasuaki Iwata joined Nintendo in 2013, and he worked on wide variety of titles during his 10-year stint at the company. He composed the opening theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/" data-ref-id="1900-6417431">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, as well as other music for the game. His first credit for Nintendo was Super Mario 3D World, and he went on to contribute music to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-8/1900-6415760/" data-ref-id="1900-6415760">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arms-review/1900-6416696/" data-ref-id="1900-6416696">Arms</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros.

The music from Breath of the Wild, however, may be his biggest legacy at Nintendo.</p><p>Any video game publisher would be lucky to have Iwata as part of their team, but he didn't state whether his next project is game-related or if he's pursuing a solo project outside of the gaming industry.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Activision launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</a>, the latest addition to the franchise's successful push into mobile gaming. However Warzone Mobile is already going to be losing support on older mobile devices starting later this month.</p><p>On November 14, Warzone Mobile's minimum specs will require iOS 17 or Android 13 or higher, as well as a GPU capable of bindless texturing. After that date, devices that can't meet those requirements will no longer receive updates or get access to the game's latest Season 1 content.</p><p>Users with older devices will still be able to play Warzone Mobile as long as version 3.10 has been downloaded and installed ahead of November 14. Unfortunately, this is a temporary reprieve. Activision's grace period will only extend six months before the revised minimum specs will be enforced for players who are still on the previous version of the game. The company also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call of Duty Mobile</a> will be offering special rewards for players whose devices are no longer compatible with Warzone Mobile. Call of Duty Mobile includes its own version of battle royale separate from Warzone. </p><p>Call of Duty Mobile Season 10 began earlier this week with a lot of new content to celebrate the game's fifth anniversary. Among the additions is a new map, Krai, which has a narrative mission in addition to serving as the latest battle-royale environment. A new trailer for the game was also released.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWH80dGivyE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RWH80dGivyE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of the anniversary event, Call of Duty Mobile's latest battle pass includes new operator skins, weapon blueprints, CoD Points, and a battle-royale class called Teleport that lets players set a marker in place on a map that they can return to at any time with the teleport function. Additional updates and features will be added throughout Call of Duty Mobile Season 10.</p>

			<p>The recently released PC version of Red Dead Redemption doesn't feature any significant improvement over the PlayStation and Nintendo Switch ports, but thankfully, modders are already coming to the rescue, turning the new version of the glorious open-world game by Rockstar Games into the definitive edition of the game.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video put together by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Digital Dreams</a> shows how much mods like<a href="https://wccftech.com/reality-redemption-overhaul-mod-is-now-available-for-rdr-pc/"> Reality Redemption</a> and ReShade ray tracing can improve the game's visuals and make it feel closer to the proper modern remaster the game deserved but that Rockstar Games did not provide.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K100] Red Dead Redemption remastered with Mods and RAYTRACING | BeyondallLimits gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yhufsG0gXd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially being the same game as the one released almost 15 years ago on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Red Dead Redemption, at the very least, runs extremely well on PC. An <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">RTX 4070 GPU</a>, which is far from being a high-range GPU, for example, has no trouble running the game at 8K resolution with the help of NVIDIA DLSS, so any other mod coming in the future making big visual changes to the game shouldn't compromise performance even on lower-end machines.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation consoles, and Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Xbox consoles via backward compatibility.</p>

<p>Following the announcement that a Death Stranding Director’s Cut will be coming to Xbox, Kojima Productions has also announced that the Death Stranding IP now belongs to the developer. </p>



<p>The announcement, which came via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/20241107-317236/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">automaton-media</a>, read, “In addition, KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS announced that the IP for this work will belong to the studio. They said that they will continue to connect more fans around the world in various forms of entertainment”.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is scheduled to release for the PlayStation 5 in 2025. However, recent news could suggest that the game could launch on day one on the Xbox platform and PC, too, if PlayStation didn’t get some form of marketing/exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Regardless<span>, today’s announcement of the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut on Xbox</a>&nbsp;suggests that Death Stranding</span> 2 will eventually be released on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait for an additional announcement of such details, with the most likely announcement coming at Geoff Keighley’s The Game Awards this December (granted, if PlayStation doesn’t have some exclusivity). </p>



<p>Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>

The first game produced by Hideo Kojima and his studio after he left Konami, Death Stranding was released five years ago on PS4 and would be followed by PC and iOS ports in 202 and 2023, respectively. As a launch special, publisher 505 Games is offering Death Stranding at a 50% discount on Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the director's cut edition, which added enhanced graphical options, gameplay changes, and new content on top of the original game. Set in a world where humanity had barely survived an extinction-level event, Death Stranding follows Sam Porter Bridges on a post-apocalyptic trek as he explores the USA and works to reconnect its various cities.</p><p dir="ltr">The game also featured a star-studded cast, with many of the characters not only being voiced by famous faces but also adopting their likenesses for Death Stranding. Bridges was played by Norman Reedus, and other roles were filled by Lea Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Troy Baker, Guillermo del Toro, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the face of all of Death Stranding's violence, its dead things, its surreal horror, and the bleakest, salted-earth portrayal of the post-apocalypse, there has always been this strong mote of hope and love and bonding and connection that's never been more necessary," Justin Clark wrote in GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746"> Death Stranding: Director's Cut review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-2-remastered-art-pops-up-online-ahead-of-wow-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Artwork and logos for Warcraft 2: Remastered have been spotted online, just a week away from Blizzard's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-announced">World of Warcraft Direct livestream</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Next week's event, set to celebrate 30 years of the Warcraft franchise, will be streamed online next Wednesday 13th November at 6pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
The timing of this leak, spotted by Wowhead after art turned up on Blizztracker, certainly suggests we'll hear more then. For now, the artwork shows characters aboard a piratical-looking sea vessel, under attack from fireballs. 
</p>
<p>
A remastered version of Warcraft 2 is a nice surprise, though perhaps not entirely unexpected following the launch of Warcraft 3 Reforged. 
</p>

<p>
Blizzard's revamp of the seminal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-houses-a-fantastic-rts-but-blizzard-has-fluffed-the-remake">Warcraft 3 improved the game's visuals</a>, added missions from an original demo and made balance changes. Overall, though, it was largely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warcraft-3-reforged-is-the-lowest-user-scored-game-on-metacritic">panned on release</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Criticisms included its reliance on the original Warcraft 3's archaic user interface and main menu, and lack of polish for most cut-scenes. Its launch also saw the original Warcraft 3 client scrubbed from Battle.net - a particular bugbear for fans. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-addresses-fan-complaints-following-controversial-warcraft-3-reforged-launch">Blizzard apologised</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-changes-refund-policy-for-warcraft-3-reforged-to-allow-refunds-upon-request">changed its refund policy</a> as a result, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-details-shambolic-leadership-decisions-behind-blizzards-disastrous-warcraft-3-remake">the damage was done</a>.
</p>
<p>
It'll be interesting to see how Blizzard plans to remaster Warcraft 2 in response to all of that.
</p>
<p>While we wait, it's worth looking back at this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modders-are-building-a-warcraft-2-remake-in-warcraft-3-reforged">fan attempt to remake Warcraft 2 within Warcraft 3 Reforged</a>, thanks to the power of mods.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two Interactive have sold their publishing label Private Division to an unnamed party, along with five of Private Division's "live and unreleased titles". The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher have also finally confirmed that they have shut down OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome devs Roll7 together with Kerbal Space Program 2 creators Intercept Games, months after performing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">mass</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-producer-confirms-mass-layoffs-contradicting-ceos-remarks">layoffs</a> at both studios.</p>
<p>"[W]e recently made the strategic decision to sell our Private Division label to focus our resources on growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term," company president Karl Slatoff said in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">an investor call last night</a>. "As part of this transaction, the buyer purchased our rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles." Take-Two are holding onto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest For The Wicked</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulslikers-are-going-to-love-ori-studios-new-arpg-no-rest-for-the-wicked">Soulsy early access ARPG</a> from the makers of Ori And The Blind Forest. </p>
<p>"We are grateful for the contributions that the Private Division team has made to our company and are confident that they will continue to achieve success in their new home," Slatoff added.</p>
<p>There's a bit more on the reasoning here in this <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-private-division-sale-those-projects-were-smaller-were-in-the-business-of-big-hits">GamesIndustry.biz interview</a> with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick. The short version is that cool dystopian rollerskating games and sprawling engineer sandboxes do not make enough cash.  </p>
<p>"We're really best at these big AAA experiences," he said. "We have the biggest intellectual properties in the interactive entertainment business, some of the biggest intellectual properties in the overall entertainment business and to make sequels to existing beloved franchises as well as to create new hit intellectual properties is our mission.</p><p>"The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well," Zelnick went on. "However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we're in the business of making great big hits."</p>
<p>Take-Two have had "strong second quarter results" for their fiscal year 2025, something Zelnick largely attributes in this week's investor call to "the continued success of the Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands franchises" (Borderlands, you might recall, recently had a movie adaptation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"benefited" Borderlands game sales</a> despite being a load of old rope). Zelnick anticipates "record" performance in 2026 and 2027, driven by the release of GTA 6, which Take-Two still have pegged for console launch in 2025 despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">rumours it might slip to 2026</a>.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, Private Division was Take-Two's attempt to build an audience for more economical and adventurous "triple-I" games that combine the gloss of a GTA with relatively eccentric mechanics or stories. Take-Two aren't the only company to cut back on smaller experiments of late. Last month, Ubisoft confirmed that they had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/most-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-devs-have-moved-to-other-projects-ubisoft-confirm-following-report-about-rejected-sequel-pitch">broken up the team responsible for the well-regarded Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> (there were no layoffs).</p>
<p>In the wake of stagnating growth brought on by over-ambitious expansion during the Covid lockdown years, the investor-facing mindset appears currently to be: if it's not Assassin's Creed or GTA-scale, what's the point?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is an enhanced version of the original PlayStation 4 release which launched in late 2019 worldwide. The new version of the game is undoubtedly the best way to experience Sam Bridge's story, as we highlighted in our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Death Stranding Director’s Cut is without a doubt the best way to step into the shoes of Sam Bridges, at least for those that haven’t seen Kojima’s vision of a ruined America. What Kojima Productions brings to the PlayStation 5 are performance and additions that make the experience play better than ever, although what’s actually new to the game feels lacking compared to what’s come in other definitive Sony collections. With all of the additions and enhancements seamlessly integrated into the Director’s Cut, there’s little reason to consider playing the first draft of Hideo Kojima’s vision if you can get your hands on this new release.</em></p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII PlayStation 5 Pro patch uses some of the console's features to deliver the best version of the game until the launch of the PC version.</p>
<p>From today, owners of the upgraded PS5 model will be able to enjoy the second entry in the remake project with a variety of improvements introduced by the 1.050 patch. The patch introduces <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Versatility Mode</a>, which targets 60 FPS like Performance Mode but offers a high resolution equivalent to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Im0BR2QmIk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Graphics Mode</a> thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler. Additionally, the update uses the PlayStation 5 Pro High CPU Frequency Mode to offer a more stable framerate throughout the game.</p>
<p>Besides providing the details of the PlayStation 5 Pro patch, Square Enix also shared a few screenshots showcasing how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth looks on the system in Versatility Mode. You can check them out right below.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide today. With improved specs and the aforementioned PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the system introduces improvements to over 50 titles that have already received their PS5 Pro patch. Even games that haven't received a dedicated patch can see improvements, as showcased by some <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-playstation-5-pro-test/">early tests</a> conducted earlier this week.</p>

Saving in Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode is only available to solo players, and you can only save one solo match at a time, which means if you leave the match without saving, there is no save to return to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, who has 2.11 million subscribers on YouTube, set out to break his personal best of round 141 and to hit round 200 before the disastrous mistake put an end to the attempt.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">do NOT do this on round 147 in black ops 6 zombies 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/QftwaSjISE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/QftwaSjISE</a></p>— Milo (@MrRoflWaffles) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrRoflWaffles/status/1854317500126626153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The disaster began when a confident MrRoflWaffles signaled his intention to save and quit then load back into the match. "This is how this works chat," he declared. "You quit the game, you reload in, and you try not to get bugs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MrRoflWaffles, perhaps moving too fast through Black Ops 6’s pause menu for his own good, accidentally selected ‘leave match’ rather than ‘save and quit.’ Despite the ‘leave game?’ warning pop up, MrRoflWaffles proceeded, putting an end to the run forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MrRoflWaffles’ chat couldn’t believe what they’d witnessed, with various messages of disbelief littering the screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Realization then kicked in, and, as you’d expect, MrRoflWaffles couldn’t believe what he’d done. “I left?!” he said. “What?! What?! What?! Are you kidding me?! You’re kidding me! You’re joking chat. Noooooooo!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“12 hours of my life,” MrRoflWaffles eventually sighed after a period of silence. “The bugs won. I’d rather have fought the bugs! I can’t believe I just did that. I’m in pain.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, who’s to blame? MrRoflWaffles for accidentally pressing the wrong button, or developer Treyarch for putting the 'leave match' and 'save and quit' buttons right next to each other in the Zombies pause menu? For his part, MrRoflWaffles said it was entirely his mistake, but called on Treyarch to make the leave match button a 'hold for three seconds' selection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I really want to blame Treyarch for putting the leave button next to the save button,” MrRoflWaffles said. “I want to blame them, but honestly this is my fault. I pressed the button.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/screenshot-2024-11-07-095630-1730977686676.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">MrRoflWaffles reacts in disbelief after accidentally ending his Black Ops 6 Zombies run. Image credit: MrRoflWaffles / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a desperate bid to save the run, MrRoflWaffles pulled the power cable and ethernet cord out of his Xbox, hoping Black Ops 6 would somehow forget what had transpired. But, alas, the game remembered. No save files were available upon loading back in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A clearly devastated MrRoflWaffles decided to end his stream early, saying that starting all over again “tilted” would only cause him to die early on in a subsequent run. But he insisted he would continue his bid to hit round 200 — perhaps once he’s had a lie down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode yourself?

Your immense love and interest mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom, and it was incredible to see everyone creating such unique Zois during our 'inZOI: Character Studio' demo period.</blockquote><blockquote>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing 'Canvas' to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an enormous number of uploads. Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI. Your feedback and insights made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</blockquote><blockquote>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from inZOI: Character Studio and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have decided to release inZOI in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we couldn't bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving inZOI the best possible start.</blockquote><blockquote>It's said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI — a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.</blockquote><blockquote>Until the release date, we'll continue working to improve any areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come. We'll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you'll join us on this journey toward inZOI's Early Access and beyond.</blockquote><blockquote>With love,</blockquote><blockquote>Kjun</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-first-preview-beautiful-and-full-of-potential-but-still-a-bit-hollow"><u>In IGN's preview if Inzoi</u></a>, we said: "The game’s world is extremely beautiful but somewhat empty in motion, permeated by a lack of grounding lore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>In addition to Xbox, the director's cut version of the game - described as the "definitive vision" of Death Stranding - is also available on PC and PS5. </p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut "challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic 'Death Stranding' event", the official blurb reads. "This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America."</p>
<p>Death Stranding Director's Cut on Series X/S includes support for Xbox Achievements. In addition, this version of the game also boasts features such as Photo Mode.</p>
<p>Those interested can scoop up Death Stranding Director's Cut for just £18 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p?dm_i=74N0,SXRP,1MPOSW,3X2YT,1">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">PC</a>. This deal is only available for a limited time, with the full price being £35. There is also an upgrade option for players who already own Death Stranding on PC. It remains full price on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA01968_00-DEATHSTRANDINGEU">PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Along with today's Xbox news, Kojima Productions also announced it now has full ownership of the Death Stranding IP.</p>

Last year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kojima-productions-announces-partnership-with-a24-for-death-stranding-movie"> American film and TV production company A24 had partnered with Kojima Productions</a> to bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation">live-action Death Stranding movie to life</a>.

</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is also in the works. Subtitled On the Beach, we got another look at the upcoming game back in September. This included its very realistic photo mode and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion</a>, Dollman.</p>
<p>At the same time, Hideo Kojima said he knew Death Stranding 2's release date already, but he refrained from sharing that news with the public. The developer said while he and his team were working "in preparation" for the release date, he could not confirm it until "some point next year".</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2s-release-date-wont-be-revealed-until-some-point-next-year">appears to still be on course for a 2025 release</a>, however. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has an upbeat outlook on this year's Borderlands film, and said that the  "disappointing" movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>It's fair to say that the Borderlands film did not take off to the degree many had hoped and will not exactly go down in a Hall of Fame alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">HBO's The Last of Us</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-series-passes-impressive-viewer-milestone-after-six-months">Amazon's Fallout</a>, both of which were praised by fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>Alas, for poor ol' Borderlands, this year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was instead branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. Eesh. The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>

<p>Zelnick commented on the film's performance last night during an earnings call for Take-Two. When an investor asked about the project and how it contributed to the company, Zelnick stated Take Two didn't "really need to break out the contribution from the film because while it was economically positive, it wasn't material" to the company's results.</p><p>"Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalogue sales," he continued. "So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalogue sales and that can be a good thing."</p>
<p>That's not to say Take-Two is now going to go all in on film and television adaptations for its various IPs.</p>
<p>"All that said, we're really selective. And one of the reasons we have been so selective about licensing is we would really prefer that everything that comes out with our brands in it is really, really successful," Zelnick stated. "And we can't guarantee that, especially when it's out of our hands. So we have licensed other titles, we'll continue selectively… emphasis on the word selectively."</p>
<p>I now wonder what could be next...?</p>

Writing on social media, Pitchford stated he was "going to keep making stuff" and subsequently brought the English rock band into the conversation.</p><p>As for what is next from the series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Borderlands 4 was announced back in August</a>. While the team at Gearbox has not announced a release date yet, it has said the game will be coming in 2025.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> publisher Take-Two has doubled down on the game's expected late 2025 launch window, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-recommits-to-autumn-2025-launch-following-delay-rumour">following earlier rumours that Rockstar could still delay</a> the game's arrival.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two's latest financial briefing last night pinned GTA6 to "fall of calendar [year] 2025", as previously expected. 
</p>
<p>
Other upcoming launches from the publisher include Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country - both of which simply have "fiscal 2026" launch dates. That means they'll arrive between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026.

Judas, the long-in-development next game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine, is listed with no firm launch window at all, meanwhile - it's simply down as "TBA". 
</p>
<p>
Back in February 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">Take-Two had the game listed as launching by the end of March 2025</a> - something the publisher is no longer stating. We got a quick look at the game in December 2022 at The Game Awards (it looked a lot like BioShock!) and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">saw a bit more in January of this year</a>, but have heard nothing more since.
</p>
<p>
Levine's last game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, launched in 2013 - over a decade ago.

<p>For now, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA5</a> - also released a decade ago - continues to "outperform" sales expectations, specifically through "sustained engagement" (and spending) in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. 
</p>
<p>"Sales of Grand Theft Auto V outperformed our expectations and to date, the title has sold more than 205m units worldwide," Zelnick said. "Grand Theft Auto Online also exceeded our plans, driven by sustained engagement with the summer content pack Bottom Dollar Bounties and an array of updates, including the new multistage Assault on ATT-16 [ph] mode and experience improvements such as a new anti-cheat system for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto Online."</p><p>Membership of the GTA+ subscription grew by 35 percent this year, Zelnick continued, as it added Rockstar classics such as Bully. Red Dead Redemption 2 has also continued to sell, and is now up to 67m sold since launch six years ago.</p>
<p>Zelnick previously said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-wont-be-on-a-subscription-service-on-day-one-because-take-twos-decisions-are-rational-says-ceo">not to expect GTA 6 to launch via any kind of subscription service</a>, such as Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, because Take-Two's "decisions are rational".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Details of the buyer will be revealed “relatively soon”, Take-Two Interactive Software CEO Strauss Zelnick told GamesIndustry.biz.</p>


<p>As part of the sale, the buyer now takes on all of Private Division’s catalogue of games and future projects, with the sole exception being Moon Studios’ action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, which entered Steam Early Access back in April. Other games, such as Weta Workshop’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/tales-of-the-shire-gets-a-new-march-25th-release-date/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a> has gone with the publishing label.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/02/take-two-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-studio-roll7-kerbal-space-program-2s-intercept-games/">Private Division was closing down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games</a>, seemingly as part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/17/take-two-layoffs-hit-5-of-staff-games-cancelled/">Take-Two’s cost-cutting measures</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Take-Two insisted that KSP2 would still receive updates, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">Zelnick publicly claimed</a> that the studios hadn’t been closed down. That statement was a big fat untruth, considering the WARN notices of job losses that were already available.</p>

<p>As for why they’re selling Private Division now? Zelnick just thinks indie games and smaller projects aren’t big enough to be worth Take-Two’s time.</p>
<p>Speaking to GI.biz, he said, “The team of Private Division did a great job supporting independent developers and, almost to a one, every project they supported did well. However, the scale of those projects was, candidly, on the smaller side, and we’re in the business of making great big hits.”</p>
<p>Take-Two, naturally, has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>Along with basically every sci-fi universe of note</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
The dominion of hated Super Earth threatens to expand afresh as Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt toys openly with the prospect of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> cross-over games, beginning with tabletop wargame Trench Crusade and extending to, well, take your pick. Arrowhead's appetite for other licenses appears insatiable. It's the kind of sheer expansionism you'd expect from Earth's loathsome regime, whose "managed democracy" propaganda continues to enthrall thousands of hapless disposable imperialists. Pilestedt even wants to make a Fifth Element game! Milla Jovovich is spinning in her grave. Milla Jovovich isn't dead, you say? Well, that's good news at least.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Pilestedt pitched the Trench Crusade crossover last week in a Xitter reply. The debonair vultures of <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/helldivers-2-cco-wants-crossover-sickest-thing-imaginable/">Videogamer</a> subsequently swooped in and did an article about it, which Pilestedt <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1853793032249765932">has also replied to</a>. "Yeah, but these are just musings," he qualified, noting that stirring too many or the wrong kind of third-party license into the Helldivers world might "dilute the IP". 
</p>
<p>
While this might read like an attempt to stave off further reporting, Piletstedt simply couldn't help sharing "an extended list of IPs that I really would love to do a take on", which the jolly jackals of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-creative-boss-doesnt-want-to-dilute-it-with-crossovers-but-his-list-of-dream-choices-has-some-real-deep-cuts/">PCGamer</a> have seized in their slavering jaws. And now, we're writing it up too. What kind of creature is Rock Paper Shotgun in this particular Attenborough scenario? We are <em>bugs</em>, of course. We are a horde of alien insects, emerging triumphantly from our burrows to chew upon the carcass of this story. Without further ado, here's Pilestedt's list.
</p>
<blockquote><p>

- Aliens
</p>
<p>
- Starship Troopers
</p>
<p>
- Terminator
</p>
<p>
- Predator
</p>
<p>
- Star Wars
</p>
<p>
- Fifth Element
</p>
<p>
- Blade Runner
</p>
<p>
- Warhammer 40k
</p>
<p>
- Trench Crusade
</p>
<p>
- Mutant Chronicles
</p>
<p>
- Dropzone Commander
</p></blockquote>
<p>
You could argue that there are already bits and pieces of those in Helldivers 2 as it stands. Starship Troopers is, of course, the book-and-movie franchise Helldivers takes inspiration from. The game's satirical forever-war fiction is basically 40K but without the crenelations and waxen seals. The Terminator, Alien and Predator loom large in the design of Helldivers enemy factions. Still, I see a few untapped possibilities here that might take Helldivers in fascinating directions. Here's a brief list.
</p>
<p>
- Do a Terminator expansion where one of your team-mates could be a Terminator in a skinsuit. Most of my team-mates are trying to kill me anyway.
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to add xenomorphs, make it so they can abduct Helldivers and cocoon them, giving colleagues a window of time in which to rescue them before they're facehugged
</p>
<p>
- If you're going to do Warhammer 40K, don't just add Space Marines. Give us the option of turning ourselves into Dreadnoughts when we die. Also, endow each map with an ambient level of warp activity, with demons emerging if you commit too much heresy (e.g. by drop-podding your comrades)
</p>
<p>
- As for Starship Troopers, let us talk to the bugs using telepathy. It's what Edge would want, and it actually happens at the end of the  Verhoeven film. Spoilers, I guess!!!!!

			<p>As someone of a certain age, I’ve never really got into podcasts – a reaction not helped by the fact that everybody and their dog seem to have one nowadays. In fact I think I’ve actually been on more podcasts than I’ve actually listened to… That said, I can see the appeal of long form audio treatments of interesting topics, and especially the kind of spooky or dark content that works so well in that format. Dark and Deep takes the genre of conspiracy and haunted podcasts and weaves it into a disturbing and twisted tale with a truly unique artstyle.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark and Deep Launch Trailer [ON STEAM AUGUST 13]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n7KP0nurg5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central premise of Dark and Deep concerns the question of who is Samuel Judge, an IT specialist and loner who may be wrapped up in mysterious conspiracies. You play as the aforementioned Samuel and must unravel the increasingly weird situations you are thrust into whilst only relying on the hints revealed through enigmatic webchat conversations and snippets of the Dark and Deep podcast. What transpires feels like a fever dream that takes you from an argument over a stolen sandwich to deadly encounters with ghostly snakes and more.</p>


<p>Booting up Dark and Deep immediately strikes you with the singular vision of its distinctive artstyle. Solo dev Walter Woods has spent years immersed in the beautifully Gothic aesthetics of nineteenth century artist, Gustav Doré, and the result is as effective as it is unique. The environments you explore are made up of the monochromatic hash effects that characterise Dore’s style interspersed with more photo realistic modern offices and server rooms. This combination creates a techno-Gothic dreamy Hellscape that is perhaps Dark and Deep’s greatest feature.</p>


<p>Playing from a first-person perspective, exploration is mostly linear, aside from some puzzles that require a certain amount of backtracking. This approach works well to push you forward and the final build is much more focused and streamlined than the demo one I played a few months back. Aside from navigating the environments you will be blocked by some puzzles that require you to make use of a number of mysterious picture frames that you find and also drops of ember – bright shining orbs that power strange devices and move obstacles. A certain amount of platforming is needed to progress and it is here that the game sometimes falls down (or at least the character does…) as falling sends you back to the beginning of the section and can become frustrating –&nbsp;even with updates to improve collision detection.</p>
<p>The first of the frames you find reveals hidden objects and handholds on walls, whilst the next is used to destroy the skulking enemies who try to sabotage you by stealing ember. Later ones have other specific powers which I won’t spoil here and there a number of areas that force you to switch between them to progress. The overall loop is therefore set but the different frames do allow for a decent amount of variety within what could have been a very straight forward walking sim setup.</p>

<p>Storytelling here is kept to a minimum in order to ensure that you constantly feel on edge, but the mood is more of suspense than straight out horror. Throughout the levels you’ll occasionally come across computer desks which can be interacted with to read chat logs and listen to the eponymous podcasts. This slow drip feed of information is effective and even by the game’s ending there are questions left to ponder.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Dark and Deep is a focused and atmospheric title that doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. Most of this time is spent immersed in the unique aesthetic and it stands out amongst the many other copycat PT wannabes that flood the horror tag on Steam. The ending is interesting although some of the imagery felt too separated from the Doré influence and instead moved into more conventional folk horror. All in all, Dark and Deep is a well polished and fascinating indie horror that has a look and feel all of its own, and for that it deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>

            <p>Calling a game ‘no frills’ or ‘no nonsense’ is always a back-handed compliment, because it sounds like you're saying it's a bit straightforward and simple. And yes, that’s exactly what I’m saying here. Acts Of Blood feels like a spiffy PS2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> brawler; a slightly tighter old Yakuza game, or a stripped-back <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sifu">Sifu</a>. It’s snacky and a bit janky, but it’s also great coffee break fodder, assuming you want to spend your break breaking a selection of heavy objects over the crumbly skulls of ne’er-do-wells. I mean, they might have done some things well, I don’t know them. But they aren’t doing any well to my character in the game, so violence it is.</p>

<p>As you’ll see from the trailer above, Acts Of Blood channels the relentless martial arts beatdowns of films like The Raid. What’s a little less obvious, due to all the cuts, is how the combat doesn’t quite flow together as well as I’d hoped. It’s smooth enough to play, although there’s a fair few canned counter and finisher animations that don’t play especially nice with whatever the other enemies are doing at the time, resulting in a bit of janky disconnect. Still, I found myself won over by some very smooth performance, some lovely kick combos, and how fun it was to lob fire axes across the room for some very decisive kills.</p>
<p>You can see how you feel about this yourself, anyway, since there’s a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/">on Steam here</a>. Here’s the story setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the bustling city of Bandung, Hendra's life is torn apart when his family is slain by his father's business rival. Left alone and seeking justice, the college law student finds no help from the corrupt legal system that protects the killers. Discovering a powerful group behind the attack, Hendra decides to take revenge himself, determined to make them pay for their actions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Features include “Dynamic Brutal Combat” (yes to brutal, rain check on dynamic), “Various Melee &amp; Firearm Weapons”, “Destructible Environmental Elements”, “Traditional Parkour” (you can slide on things), and “Outfit Customization”. Misgivings aside, I got a good 20 minutes of fun out of it, and I reckon it’s worth the &lt;3GB download, if just to throw an axe at someone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In its Q3 2024 earnings report, published yesterday, South Korean publisher Kakao Games provided updates on its upcoming game slate, including the highly anticipated Unreal Engine 5 action MMORPGs ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey.</p>
<p>The first game, as you might remember, is nothing more than ArcheAge 2's rebrand. In late September, when the title change was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> and explained, we still got a generic 2025 release window. However, the updated Kakao Games release schedule has moved ArcheAge Chronicles to the fiscal year 2026, which is to say, at some point in the calendar year 2026.</p>
<p>Two additional games are also dated for FY2026: the looter shooter Project S and the action RPG based on The Swordmaster's Youngest Son IP. All of these games will be released globally for PC and consoles, just like <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-ue5-mmorpg-gets-striking-gameplay-trailer-confirmed-for-pc-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>. The MMORPG developed by NPIXEL's Chrono Studio will launch in the last quarter of 2025, around this time next year. Here's a brief overview by the producer:</p>
<p><em>Chrono Odyssey is an "open-world MMORPG where time dictates destiny," and we are committed to integrating all the core elements showcased in the trailer into the game. Players will be able to experience exhilarating battles with colossal bosses, adventures that utilize the "Chronotector," a device that manipulates time and space, complex characters, and innovative storytelling. We look forward to the day we can share these features with you.</em></p>
<p>Kakao Games is also publishing Path of Exile 2 in Korea and the strategy RPG Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch globally. The latter game has just launched <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2530490/Lost_Eidolons_Veil_of_the_Witch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> and will get a full release next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>In Q2 2025, Kakao aims to publish version 1.0 of the action roguelite shooter Section 13 (also currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2111870/Section_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>), while Q3 2025 will see the Korean debut of Project Q, an Unreal Engine 5 isometric open world MMORPG for PC and mobile made by Lionheart Studio, the team behind Odin: Valhalla Rising. <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/en/it/11158890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Korean media</a>, Kakao has also signed a global publishing deal for Project Q.</p>
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2025, Kakao will launch two more games globally alongside the aforementioned Chrono Odyssey: the zombie survival game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073940/God_Save_Birmingham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God Save Birmingham</a> for PC and the MMORPG Ares: Rise of Guardians for mobile devices and PC.</p>

            <p>Putting aside my natural annoyance at<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater"> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> for almost beating out the Twarhammer series in the headline real estate wars, I am more than a little excited to play. Some days, you simply must feast on a tree frog, and while we still don’t have a solid release date, that day doesn’t feel <em>too</em> far away. Good news for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> fans, and perhaps <em>gooder news</em> for a dozen strapline writers sweating profusely, soiling themselves in anticipation of using “kept you waiting, huh?”.</p>
<p>Until then, I at least have a steady drip feed of new information to keep me sated, the latest of which is the substantial hint that there'll be some new dialogue in the game, as per the video below. Alongside that, the previously pseudonymous Suzetta Miñet - who was credited with voicing EVA in MGS3 and Peace Walker - has revealed herself to be Jodi Benson, the voice of Ariel in Disney’s The Little Mermaid. Cheers for the spot, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-voice-actors-confirm-that-the-remake-will-have-new-dialogue/">Automaton West</a>.</p>

<p>The video features Benson, The Boss actor Lori Alan, and David Hayter, talking shop about reprising their roles for the MGS 3 remake. Konami have previously said that Delta will use the original game’s VO in its entirety, but it sounds like there’s actually some new dialogue, too. At around 11:50 in the video, Hayter asks his co-stars about their experience doing “some of the new lines”. Alan and Benson then go on to talk about stepping back in the recording booth to revisit their characters from 20 years ago.</p><p>Benson, when asked why she used a pseudonym for the original Snake Eater, says that the project’s voice director suggested the name change due to the other “family based, children based” projects Benson was involved with at the time. The ‘Suzetta Miñet’ pseudonym was based on her pet dog, Suzette Monet.</p>
<p>There’s lots of other lovely anecdotes in the full video, and it’s worth watching just for how proud Hayter looks of himself when he replies to Benson’s story of keeping a copy of Snake Eater in her basement with “in a box!”.</p>
<p>While, again, there’s no solid release date as of yet, a hastily deleted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/leak-suggests-a-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-exactly-20-years-after-the-original">Gamestop Xitter post this June</a> did list a 17th November release date - exactly 20 years after the original, although that does feel considerably less likely now we’re so close.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is arguably the most impactful first-person shooter series ever made. What started as a World War II experiment turned out to be one of the best-selling franchises ever concocted, and today, the yearly Call of Duty release still nets tens of millions of sales. In this breakdown, we’re looking at all Call of Duty games, ranked by their impact and how good they were.</p>



<p>I’m aware that’s one of the most inflammatory things I’ll ever say and that this is mostly subjective, but take a look through and see how you feel about this Call of Duty ranking.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-call-of-duty-games-ranked">All Call of Duty Games Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-21-call-of-duty-vanguard">21. Call of Duty: Vanguard</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vanguard looked great on the surface but it was a paltry game that disappointed fans everywhere when it was released in 2021. It boasted one of the weakest competitive ecosystems in years and everything from the short-lived campaign to the multiplayer platform lacked something. </p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to save Vanguard by weaving in maps from older games, but it wasn’t enough. It also heralded the arrival of Caldera, a Warzone map that pulled players away from Verdansk, and that’s often seen as the biggest mistake Activision has ever made.</p>



<h3 id="h-20-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">20. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III (2023)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Ah, Modern Warfare III. The ‘DLC’ Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When Modern Warfare III was released in 2023, fans were dismayed at the 3-hour campaign and the fact that it felt more like an expansion to 2022’s Modern Warfare II. In many ways, it was, and despite Activision’s attempts to placate fans by saying it was a premium release, everyone who invested in it felt conned.</p>



<p>Not good.</p>







<h3 id="h-19-call-of-duty-black-ops-4">19. Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 took the unusual route of being the only mainline entry in the series to completely bypass the campaign, opting for the traditional multiplayer modes and the series’ first foray into the world of Battle Royale with its Blackout mode. </p>



<p>This served as a precursor to the popular Warzone mode that would be released in 2020. Overall, it was a fun iteration of Call of Duty, but not having a campaign hindered any long-term replayability once Warzone and the next entry in the series were released.</p>



<p>Black Ops 4 came out in 2018, and to this day, it was Activision’s last attempt at a futuristic Call of Duty game. Make of that what you will.</p>



<h3 id="h-18-call-of-duty-3">18. Call of Duty 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty 3 is likely the game you haven’t played and you aren’t really missing much. This entry is the only one never to be released on PC, and with consoles being multiple generations ahead now, being able to go back and replay it is difficult, so it’s best to skip this and just start your <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> journey with the next entry.</p>



<h3 id="h-17-call-of-duty-infinite-warfare">17. Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Infinite Warfare was Activision’s final attempt at taking Call of Duty into the future before going back to its roots with WWII. It would flip back into the near future with Black Ops 4 in 2018, but you’ve seen where that ended up on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<p>This is a game that often divides fans as it receives both praise and criticism depending on who you ask, but this marks the end of a dark period in the franchise and I think we can all agree that Call of Duty has seen much better entries in the years since.</p>



<h3 id="h-16-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-2022">16. Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare II was a short, forgettable experience that players didn’t gel with. It marked an all-time low for the series, and the game’s competitive ecosystem didn’t fare too well either. It didn’t have the energy that previous games had, and while the campaign wasn’t bad, it was just far too short to keep players engaged for long – and it was buggy as all hell.</p>



<p>It’s not the worst Call of Duty game ever, but it’s far, <strong>far </strong>from being the best.</p>



<h3 id="h-15-call-of-duty-wwii">15. Call of Duty: WWII</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following three years of the Call of Duty series going into the future, Activision went back to its roots with a World War II-era game. Although it was a good change of pace, Activision failed to deliver and it quickly became a forgotten title in the series as there have been better World War II-era entries before and since. </p>



<p>It is worth playing the campaign if you can get the game cheaply enough, but you won’t miss much if you bypass this entry. Many will tell you that WWII had solid multiplayer, but they’re remembering it wrong…</p>



<h3 id="h-14-call-of-duty-black-ops-3">14. Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>After Sledgehammer Games took the series into the future with Advanced Warfare, Treyarch followed suit with Black Ops 3. As with other futuristic Call of Duty games, Black Ops 3 cemented the fact that the series doesn’t work as a sci-fi shooter. </p>



<p>Black Ops 3 does have its moments though, including a great Zombies mode. But when compared to the previous two entries in the series, Black Ops 3 doesn’t hold up.</p>



<h3 id="h-13-call-of-duty-ghosts">13. Call of Duty: Ghosts</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Like Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty: Ghosts is a game that divides opinions. Some players have fond memories of it while some think it is one of the worst entries in the series.</p>



<p>This game did serve as a precursor for what would become more standard with multiplayer games in the future in that it featured various collaborations with pop-culture icons, including Snoop Dogg as an announcer and both Michael Myers from Halloween and Predator being playable characters on DLC maps.</p>



<p>We all know how that panned out, though.</p>



<h3 id="h-12-call-of-duty-advanced-warfare">12. Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Advanced Warfare was a fairly forgettable title that expanded on the jetpack era of Call of Duty, sitting in the middle of the series that spanned Black Ops II to 2018’s Black Ops 4. The campaign featured a solid cast fronted by the likes of Kevin Spacey and Troy Baker, but looking back, I can’t recall a single detail of the story.</p>



<p>Sledgehammer Games tried to get creative with the UI and various other mechanics in Advanced Warfare, which earns the game some extra points when we’re looking at all Call of Duty games ranked, but it wasn’t enough to push it into the top ten COD games ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-11-call-of-duty-2">11. Call of Duty 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was immediately clear after the first game that Activision had a winner on its hands, but few could have predicted the rise that it would go on to have. </p>



<p>Call of Duty 2 is more of the same when compared to the first entry, with one of the most interesting facts being that it wasn’t released on PlayStation. This means that it is understandable if many players haven’t had the opportunity to play it, but it is worth hunting down if you haven’t played this great entry in the series.</p>



<p>For many of today’s OGs, Call of Duty 2’s multiplayer platform is where <strong>it all began</strong>.</p>







<h3 id="h-10-call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">10. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Activision’s studios introduced Black Ops Cold War, a game built on the back of a work-from-home initiative and excessive crunch. It featured one of the shortest development cycles ever, but despite that, it wasn’t bad. It featured a stellar multiplayer ecosystem that engaged many millions of players, and the campaign wasn’t awful.</p>



<p>It had a somewhat bizarre Zombies mode that didn’t resonate too well with fans, but it was ambitious and it gave them something else in terms of meat on the bones away from strictly multiplayer or the COD campaign.</p>



<p>It’s a love-hate game for many, but I for one adored Cold War.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3">9. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>One of the more interesting things to note about Modern Warfare 3 is it seemed to be released on everything – even the Nintendo Wii and Nintendo DS. Talk about accessibility.</p>



<p>Given that it was the final chapter of the original Modern Warfare series, the marketing for Modern Warfare 3 was very extensive. What was ultimately delivered ticked many boxes for fans, and it introduced some of the best core elements that we’ve come to know and expect from a Call of Duty game today.</p>



<p>For instance, Kill Confirmed debuted in Modern Warfare 3, and that’s now considered one of the best Call of Duty game modes ever. </p>



<p>The campaign was a perfect ending to several years of Modern Warfare, the Spec Ops / Survival Mode was brilliant, and the multiplayer platform was polished.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-call-of-duty-world-at-war">8. Call of Duty: World At War</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: World At War is the second game by Treyarch in what would become the yearly trend of going back and forth with Infinity Ward. </p>



<p>World At War felt like Treyarch was finding its feet and getting ready to become a dominant force in the franchise with the Black Ops series. This game also marked the first time the popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-will-have-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies mode</a> would be featured in the series and became a huge selling point for the game and is still worth going back to today if you’re a fan of the mode, it still holds up very well.</p>



<p>Some of World at War’s maps are still being reused in modern games, which goes to show how beloved the game’s multiplayer was.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019">7. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare (2019) was seen as a soft reboot of the franchise that had pulled in so many millions of gamers over the years. It was dubbed a resurgence of the series, and the anticipation in the market before it dropped was nothing short of palpable.</p>



<p>When it was delivered, players worldwide fell in love with the game’s campaign, and the new movement mechanics woven into the multiplayer platform would set a standard for years to come. It also served as the basis for Call of Duty: Warzone, one of the top battle royale games ever made and one of the best COD games of all time.</p>



<p>Modern Warfare dwindled with II and III, but the opening title is memorable, and that’s why it sits so high on this list of all Call of Duty games ranked.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s a surprising entry.</p>



<p>In 2024, Treyarch and Raven Software combined forces to release Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, the most highly anticipated game in the series in <strong>years</strong>. It took years to develop, and when it was finally pushed live, it became the biggest Call of Duty launch in history. </p>



<p>It’s not perfect, but it took all the failings of the previous games and turned them upside down. </p>



<p>For instance, it had a meaty campaign that took around 7 – 9 hours to finish, provided you wanted to collect all the hidden goodies and achievements. It returned to a round-based Zombies operating model across two phenomenal maps, and the multiplayer platform featured decent maps, all-new movement mechanics, and a stellar array of weapons.</p>



<p>All of a sudden, the internet was ablaze with <strong>Black Ops 6</strong>. From the camo grinds to the intense marketing campaign, everyone knew about Black Ops 6, even people who didn’t play games. It was everywhere, it was everything, and it was arguably the best Call of Duty game released in several years.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-call-of-duty-black-ops-2">5. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is often rightfully hailed as one of the best entries in the series. </p>



<p>It features a branching, non-linear campaign with multiple endings, a first for the series, and has one of the most solid multiplayer modes the series has ever seen. </p>



<p>Black Ops 2 grossed over $500 million in its first 24 hours of release, a gaming record that stood until GTA V was released in 2013. It also was the first game in the series to be released on the Wii U, although it is understandable if you never played that version of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-call-of-duty">4. Call of Duty</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Following the departure of many Medal of Honor developers from 2015, Inc., a new studio called Infinity Ward was created and set out to make a new World War shooter, which would quickly go on to become more successful than the Medal of Honor series. </p>



<p>The original Call of Duty game was originally released as a PC exclusive, but it was eventually ported to the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 as Call of Duty Classic in 2009 following the release of Modern Warfare 2.</p>



<p>It’s where it all began and it’s still one of the highest-rated Call of Duty games ever made, so you can’t say fairer than that.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare">3. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Call of Duty pivoted away from the World War era and into the modern age with Call of Duty 4, a move that took the series to new heights. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare was released in 2007, the same year as Halo 3, and it helped to push online console gaming into the mainstream as millions of players jumped into the game to battle it out with other players across the world. </p>



<p>Modern Warfare received universal critical acclaim, with its Metacritic scores ranging from 92-94 on most major platforms. It’s often considered the starting point for many veteran Call of Duty fans, and its simplicity is desperately sought out by players even today. Things have become too complicated in the Call of Duty space – this is when things were simple enough to just be enjoyable.</p>



<p>In 2016, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered was released, with Activision’s teams diving back into the full game and recreating what made the series so great. To this day, it’s the only Call of Duty game to be remastered in full, multiplayer included.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-call-of-duty-black-ops">2. Call of Duty: Black Ops</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>By the end of the decade, Infinity Ward had firmly established the Modern Warfare series and Treyarch needed a sub-series for its bi-yearly releases. </p>



<p>Black Ops is set during the Cold War in the 1960s and the opinion of which series is better is often fairly split, with some preferring Treyarch’s offerings and some preferring Infinity Ward’s. The game featured licensed music by the likes of Eminem and The Rolling Stones but notably included an original song by Avenged Sevenfold, a trend that would continue until Black Ops 4. </p>



<p>This game is often considered the peak of Call of Duty, and it’s no wonder why Treyarch has revisited the game’s concepts time and again. By 2024, we’re sitting on <strong>six </strong>Black Ops games, even if they’ve not all reached the expectations players have had for them. </p>



<p>Black Ops was innovative, it had a flawless campaign, a remarkable Zombies mode, and the multiplayer was second to none. It helped ease many into the idea of Call of Duty esports, a concept that would be bolstered immeasurably with Black Ops II.</p>



<p>This is easily a contender for the title of the best Call of Duty game ever released, but it doesn’t quite snag it.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-2009">1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (2009)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Modern Warfare 2 is legendary, and that’s all there is to it.</p>



<p>From the expansion of the campaign established in 2007’s COD 4, to a multiplayer platform that users are still logging on to enjoy all these years later, Modern Warfare 2 helped grow the Call of Duty series beyond epic proportions.</p>



<p>In 2023, Modern Warfare III was released with a full remastered mapset pulled from MW2, and it was a win with fans worldwide – particularly the more veteran players who got started on 2009’s MW2.</p>



<p>Even the side content, like the game’s Spec Ops mode, was lauded by fans worldwide.</p>



<p>This game gave rise to some of the most monumental maps ever made, including Terminal and Rust, and every inch of the campaign can be remembered all these years later.</p>



<p>There is nothing bad to say about MW2, and it’s the best Call of Duty game ever made.</p>

<p>Call of Duty is the largest and most impactful first-person shooter franchise ever made. Every year, a new title hits the series and it’s soaked up by tens of millions of players worldwide – it never stops being popular. It’s not the only shooter out there, though. With that being said, we’re piecing together the best games like Call of Duty in this guide, just in case you want an alternative.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about the best games like COD that could replace this shooter series in your library.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-call-of-duty">Top Games Like Call of Duty</h2>



<p>Call of Duty spans several ‘eras’, from the Second World War to the Cold War, and from near-future theatres of war to the Gulf. It has taken players from space to the jungles of Vietnam, and from stealthy situations to all-out, guns-blazing engagements. It’s hard to compete with that diversity, but here are the best games like Call of Duty that try hard to beat the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-counter-strike-2">5. Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Counter-Strike 2, the recently released sequel to CSGO, is another FPS title that is commonly related to Call of Duty. The game is similar to COD’s Search and Destroy mode, which pits teams against each other, as one team tries to defuse the other team’s bomb.</p>



<p>Counter-Strike 2 is an incredibly popular game within the FPS community, making it a great alternative to those who enjoy Call of Duty. It’s only really available to those playing keyboard and mouse on PC platforms, though – so it’s a bit limited and blocked off from the console community.</p>







<h2 id="h-4-titanfall-2">4. Titanfall 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Titanfall 2, a large-scale multiplayer FPS game, is often compared to some of COD’s more futuristic titles. Like Black Ops III, Titanfall 2 has similar mechanics such as the jetpack, which allows players to jump higher throughout the maps. Both games have a Team Deathmatch mode and other fun game modes that people can play.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the futuristic games that Call of Duty has released, then you will love Titanfall 2.</p>







<h2 id="h-3-rainbow-six-siege">3. Rainbow Six: Siege</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six: Siege is another game that draws similarities to COD’s Search and Destroy mode. The game is a 5v5 FPS title, that has modes that include defusing a bomb, saving a hostage and more. While Siege may be a bit slower-paced, both games are still incredibly similar in comparison.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six: Siege is the perfect example of a game that Call of Duty players would highly enjoy.</p>







<h2 id="h-2-halo-infinite">2. Halo Infinite</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Halo series has notoriously been known as a rival to Call of Duty. While the franchise has slowed down on releasing new games, making them inferior to COD, it still is a great alternative to those looking for a similar style of game. The most recent title, Halo Infinite, has various game modes that rival all of the modes in COD.</p>



<p>Halo Infinite, or any game within the Halo series, is a great replacement for those looking for a game similar to Call of Duty.</p>







<h2 id="h-1-battlefield-2042">1. Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Battlefield series is arguably the closest thing you’ll get to a modern Call of Duty game. </p>



<p>Battlefield 2042 in particular is one of the best games like Call of Duty, boasting typical first-person shooter combat mechanics spread across a series of maps and modes. In recent years, Call of Duty and Battlefield have become more aligned as Battlefield has become more ‘arcadey’ while Call of Duty has edged more into the bold, ambitious modes that feature vehicles and destruction.</p>



<p>Which game do you prefer when you are not playing Call of Duty? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Best Games Like Fallout | Enter The Apocalypse]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-fallout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-best-games-like-fallout-enter-the-apocalypse.1029417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-games-like-fallout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fallout is one of the best-known post-apocalyptic multimedia franchises ever made, allowing players to explore vast, open wastelands and carve out a name for themselves after the end of the world. Since spawning in the late 1990s, Fallout has gone on to inspire many similar games. With that in mind, we’re here today to identify the best games like Fallout for you to enjoy <strong>now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-games-like-fallout">Top Games Like Fallout</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for games similar to Fallout, search no further than this list. We’ve broken down what you need to go off and enjoy another romp through a ruined wasteland, a broken world, and a harrowing story. Strap on your survival gear – you’re going to need it where you’re going.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-the-outer-worlds">5. The Outer Worlds</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Outer Worlds </strong>was dubbed ‘like Fallout but in space’ by many, and that’s because it was co-created by teams who once had a hand in developing the Fallout franchise. In The Outer Worlds, players assume control of a character on an open-ended adventure across space, and like in Fallout, how the story unfolds is entirely up to you.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-starfield">4. Starfield</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Starfield </strong>is the latest open-world epic from Bethesda Game Studios, the company responsible for producing every Fallout game since 2008. It’s easily one of the best games like Fallout because it soaks up so many mechanics and elements from 2015’s Fallout 4 and 2018’s Fallout 76.</p>



<p>In Starfield, you’re left to your own devices to explore a monumental map made up of 1,000 planets. It’s a great game with incredible depth, but it doesn’t have that post-apocalyptic element you might be looking for – but our top game like Fallout has that in spades.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-s-t-a-l-k-e-r">3. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The ‘<strong>STALKER</strong>‘ series is perhaps one of the closest games to Fallout you’ll ever see. It’s a harrowing and intense series set in and around the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, and it tasks players with exploring and surviving the zone, doing battle with mutants, enemy human factions, and ethereal anomalies.</p>



<p>It’s not technically an ‘end-of-the-world’ game, but it’s damn close, and it’s easily one of the best games like Fallout you can play right now.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-the-last-of-us">2. The Last of Us</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>The Last of Us</strong> tells one of the most emotional and heart-wrenching stories of the end of the world that you’ll ever see represented in games. Like most Fallout games, The Last of Us’ story is about being some of the few survivors remaining after an apocalyptic event, and both franchises deal with concepts of loss, combat, revenge, and suffering.</p>



<p>The Last of Us is much more ‘serious’ than Fallout, and side-by-side, they look and feel nothing alike, but you can’t escape the fact that these two franchises represent the crème de la crème of post-apocalyptic gaming.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-metro">1. Metro</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>Metro </strong>is my number-one pick for games like Fallout. This series has almost unfolded in parallel alongside Fallout, with the first game in the franchise dropping just two years after Fallout 3 hit the market. Based on a novel series of the same name, Metro plunges players into post-apocalyptic Moscow, with survivors now occupying the city’s metro system while the world above burns in the nuclear fire.</p>



<p>Metro Exodus in particular is most worthy of the ‘best game like Fallout’ title, given its semi-open-world operating model and solid end-of-the-world vibes. It’s mostly linear and not so much an RPG by nature, but if you put Fallout (with some mods) side-by-side with Metro Exodus, you’d barely be able to tell the difference.</p>

<p>Riot Games’ Arcane is a show-stopper of a series that has been turning heads since the first season dropped in 2021. Fans are now getting deep into the highly anticipated second season of the show, but recently a stat surfaced showing just how much of a financial burden producing the series was on Riot Games.</p>



<p>It was confirmed in an interview with Variety that Arcane cost a whopping $250 million to produce in full. That makes it the most expensive animated series to land on linear or streaming television services <strong>ever</strong>.</p>

<p>Arcane boasts a phenomenal cast, stellar acting, and mind-blowing visuals, which is par for the course when it comes to Riot Games’ animated sequences. The company has long focused on piecing together some of the best visual content in the business, such as the punchy animated promos they assemble for the League of Legends World Championship year after year.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an interview with Variety</a>, co-founder of Riot, Marc Merrill, suggested that despite the bloated cost, the company isn’t wavering on the animation front:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our ambitions in entertainment haven’t changed. </p>



<p>We were never intending&nbsp;to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines. What&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realized that getting it right takes a lot more time than we’d originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals and teams with that in mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, Merrill addressed the cost of producing Arcane:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends is one of the most popular games ever made, and it boasts a phenomenal esports ecosystem that pulls in millions of viewers <strong>with ease</strong>. The recent League of Legends World Championship broke viewership records as the event’s grand final series was streamed live from London.</p>



<p>Do you think the $250 million investment to produce 18 episodes of a show for a streaming service is appropriate? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>
