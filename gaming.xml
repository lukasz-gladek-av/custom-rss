			<p>It's long been maintained by GTA V fans that a proper single-player DLC/expansion never came because GTA Online became too much of a focus for Rockstar Games following its enormous and continued success over the years.</p>
<p>Now, at last, we have some sort of confirmation from former Rockstar camera artist Joe Rubino, who worked on Max Payne 3 and GTA V. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with YouTuber SanInPlay</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of the team went to do Red Dead Redemption 2 right away (after the launch of Grand Theft Auto V), and I kind of took on this other project that was a standalone DLC for Grand Theft Auto that never came out. That was my thing. I was one of the main editors and camera artists and did a lot of the on-stage stuff. We split our teams into two. I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC, which Steven Ogg (the actor that played Trevor) was a very important part of.</em></p>
<p><em>Then some of the team overlapped and went to Red Dead Redemption 2 early on, and then we just kind of did this, because when that game got shelved, we spent so much money. A lot of that stuff, though, did end up making it, I believe, into later iterations of GTA Online. It's not like they wasted it. It was really, really good. What happened was when GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow, and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that. I think looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, you know? But that was a business decision that they made.</em></p>
<p><em>I was a little upset about that. Actually, a lot of the reason for me being a little sour at that time is that I was like, guys, this shit's awesome. Let's keep going, let's finish this. We went about probably halfway through it and then we put a pause on it because GTA Online was just so... People were going crazy (about it).</em></p>
<p>With Rockstar's resources, Rubino's point that the studio could have likely finished a halfway-done GTA V story standalone DLC makes sense. It was likely a decision made by the executives rather than the creative people, who would have certainly loved to release the content.</p>
<p>GTA Online is still running strong to this day. The studio has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Bottom Dollar Bounties update and promised more to come throughout the rest of the year.&nbsp;With GTA VI currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated for Fall 2025</a>, it'll be interesting to see how Rockstar handles the transition between the respective games' online modes.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review.920082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-pd100x-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>When you’re doing any sort of content creation, whether it be streaming, podcasting, recording, or whatever, one of the most important areas of your setup needs to be the microphone you use. A quality microphone will help you go from a poor production to top level in no time, and will let your listeners enjoy the soothing sounds of your voice the best way possible.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a lot of options out there that it can be tough finding that balance between what you can afford and good quality. One company trying to bridge the gap between affordable and quality is Maono.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company has a number of microphone options for all budgets. Recently, it released its new PD100X mid-level microphone to go along with its Maonocaster G1 NEO audio interface. I’ve spent the last couple of weeks using the setup as my daily driver for content, and I’m here to tell you whether or not I think it’s something you should consider if you’re looking to get into content creation of any kind.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.maono.com/products/g1neo-and-pd100x-gaming-bundle-for-game-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Retailing for $119.99 as a package</a>, it’s hard to find a better mic and mixer bundle for a better price. But price is only one part of the equation. How does everything perform under use?</p>



<p>Starting with the mixer. To be perfectly honest, it’s one of the nicer and most functional audio interfaces that I’ve used. It looks basic and only supports one XLR input, but what it does, it does really well.</p>



<p>The Maonocaster G1 NEO features 48V phantom power for your microphone and a number of streamer-friendly features without having to do much of a setup. There’s a noise reducer option that blocks out background noise such as fans quite well along with a SideChain feature that automatically lowers the volume of the music you have playing through your interface, turning it into a properly adjusted backing track for your voice over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s a simple voice changer button that adjusts the pitch of your voice if you’re into that sort of thing as well as a toggle for directly monitoring your sound through your headset. A lot of expected features, but it comes with another feature that went from being a nice-to-have to one that I can’t live without: a sound board.</p>



<p>On the device there are four extra buttons that you can use for a soundboard. From simple sound effects to clipping and using songs, you can use it for pretty much anything you can think of. Lastly, the board features Bluetooth connection, allowing you to sync your phone or any other Bluetooth audio source to pass through music, sound effects, or anything else.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-does-the-mic-sound">How Does The Mic Sound?</h3>



<p>While the interface is really nice, none of it matters if the PD100X microphone isn’t a quality sound. On that front, the word to use with it is: okay.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad mic. Like I said, it’s okay. It’s just one that you’ll need to do some work with to get it rolling out of the box. </p>



<p>It does a solid job of blocking out background noise immediately, something that even the more pricey mics can struggle with. The PD100X also is quality on keeping away any noise behind the microphone, a benefit of the cardioid polar pattern.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Connection</td><td>USB/XLR</td></tr><tr><td>Mic Type</td><td>Dynamic</td></tr><tr><td>Polar Pattern</td><td>Cardioid</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency Response</td><td>40Hz-16kHz</td></tr><tr><td>Sample Rate</td><td>48kHZ/24-bit</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Where the PD100X doesn’t perform well is handling peaking and general level stability. Every time I used it, even if I left settings alone, the slightest adjustment of your position to the mic will have you frustrated at the levels. It’s not a major problem if you’re pre-recording content or doing something that will need multiple takes. However, it can get annoying for both you and your listeners/viewers when you are doing something live and you get comments on the sound issues.</p>



<p>There are also too many issues with the gain where the slightest change will have you sounding like you are speaking through a drive-thru speaker box. I found myself messing with the gain and general audio levels too much when doing live content that it took away from the overall presentation.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/">Logitech G Has A New Gaming Keyboard, And It’s Impressive</a></h6>



<p>Should you not want to use a mixer, the PD100X also comes with a USB cable that can be connected directly to your PC. Both have their pros and cons like XLR not letting you use the RGB on the mic and the USB connection pickup up and and all clicks on the on-board wheel and mute button.</p>



<p>Additionally, should you connect via USB, you can use the Maono Link or Maono Arena apps for mixing purposes. Just know you’ll need to create an account in order to use their software.</p>



<h2 id="h-maono-maonocaster-g1-neo-amp-pd100x-review-verdict">Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO &amp; PD100X Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As a package, the Maono Maonocaster G1 NEO and PD100X are solid, especially at such an affordable price point. The interface has a lot of nice features and works well even with other branded XLR mics. Hell, I even hooked up my guitar to it via XLR, and found that it worked pretty well for that, too.</p>



<p>The mic, on the other hand, just doesn’t do much for me. It’s an okay entry level option if you decide to go with it. Just be ready, as I said, to do a bit of manual work getting it to sound right. The frustration of constantly adjusting the levels and dealing with clipping just turns me off too much when there are other options that work better straight out of the box. It also would be nice if you could just buy the interface on its own. Unfortunately, it seems that if you really want the Maonocaster G1 NEO, you have to get the mic with it.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Opening Cinematic | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the patch, a fix for the Tortured Gift of Amulets chest in Helltides means it will thankfully soon reward more items as originally intended. Boss summoning materials will be worth more gold, so players who aren't keen on actually using them can now vendor them for more profit. The sale price for Blackened Femurs, Gurgling Heads, and Trembling Hands are increasing from 20,000 to 50,000 gold, while Stygian Stones will increase from 70,000 to 150,000 gold.</p><p dir="ltr">In another change, the drop rate for Elixirs is going down, meaning players may need to rely more on crafting Elixirs to suit their needs. Conversely, the drop rates for Tempering manuals is increasing "to be more consistent." Last but not least, a welcome UI change for Tempered items will mean items will display icons for the associated Tempering affix category, instead of all Tempered affixes sharing the same icon. You can read the full patch notes for the update below.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 is currently in the middle of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/" data-ref-id="1100-6523441">Season 4 Loot Reborn update</a>, which brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">major changes to its item progression and endgame</a>.

You can still enjoy the game’s full story and reach the end. </p><p>Still, it’s rather depressing that this is the best (and most likely) outcome for most live-service games that aren’t hugely successful. Eventually, once the publisher has drained the live-service game for all it can after keeping it around in zombie mode for a bit, the servers will likely be shut off and the game made unplayable. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-the-crew-accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-1851385068&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-the-crew-accursed-farms-stop-killing-games-1851385068">We’ve seen it before.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-has-outlined-what%E2%80%99s-coming-in-fallout-76%E2%80%99s-milepost-zero-update.920040/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-76-milepost-zero/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Later this year, Fallout 76’s twentieth major update is set to hit the platform, and it has been dubbed Milepost Zero. This relatively impactful update is set to overhaul a few core mechanics in the game – and add a few that the community will welcome with open arms. It’s going to follow on from the Skyline Valley update that introduced the first new base map region to the game <strong>ever</strong>, so it’s fair to say that Fallout 76 is on a roll right now.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have a date just yet, but it’s assumed Milepost Zero will drop in September 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-milepost-zero">What’s Milepost Zero?</h2>



<p>Milepost Zero is the twentieth major Fallout 76 update, and it’s set to usher in the game’s eighteenth season. We’re a long way from 2018, and Fallout 76 now has a bustling audience that’s more than receptive to these super-sized patches. Earlier this year, when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-five-seasons/">the Fallout TV show</a> was released, Fallout 76’s popularity skyrocketed, with the game breaking player count records with ease.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has revealed what’s coming to Fallout 76 in Milepost Zero.</p>



<p>The most important change is the rework to Legendary Crafting. In the PTS, players can start getting their hands on this very soon, but it’ll be a few weeks until it arrives in the full game. The new Legendary Crafting proposal will see Legendary Cores effectively cast aside, with players instead getting ‘Legendary Particles’ when they scrap Legendary Weapons. They’ll then convert these Particles into Legendary Mods, subsequently spending Legendary Modules to apply them to Legendary Weapons.</p>



<p>I know that was an awful explanation.</p>



<p>Here’s the basic rundown:</p>



<ol>
<li>Scrap Legendary Weapons to potentially get mods or pick up plans for mods from trading or through events.</li>



<li>Scrap more Legendary Weapons to earn Legendary Particles.</li>



<li>Use Legendary Particles to craft Legendary Mods (that you unlocked earlier).</li>



<li>Use Legendary Modules to apply the mods to your weapons.</li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-what-else-is-new">What Else Is New?</h3>



<p><a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5zcmPPBTXDh7V6q8MxkmBJ/inside-the-vault-milepost-zero-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bethesda is introducing a new event</a> or questline called ‘Bump in the Road’, which will see players <strong>start their own Caravan Company</strong>. It has been suggested that this will allow players to unlock special constructs from rewards they get by doing Blue Ridge Caravan Company quests and events, and these constructs will take the form of <strong>Outposts</strong>. These outposts can be placed in addition to C.A.M.P.s, and they’ll have NPC vendors in them.</p>



<p>This is all yet to be fully confirmed by BGS.</p>







<p>Elsewhere, Mischief Night is set to return in the event rotation, and speaking of C.A.M.P.s, Bethesda is introducing a core mechanic that’ll please the best builders in the community. With Milepost Zero, a fresh feature called Best Builds will be introduced, marking special, voted-for C.A.M.P.s on the map with a ribbon and allowing users to vote on them, pushing their prestige even higher. </p>



<p>Along with that, there’s the usual array of balances – including a combat-based overhaul – and bug fixes, plus a few quality-of-life improvements for good measure.</p>



<p>Not bad.</p>

That's thanks in large part to the EU's Digital Markets Act and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-finally-lets-other-companies-launch-their-own-storefronts-on-the-app-store">the resulting changes made to Apple's polices</a> that made it possible for third-party companies to launch their own storefronts on the App Store. </p><p>Today's statement is only the latest in Apple and Epic's ongoing regulatory feud, with Epic having taken Apple to task over the 30% cut it takes in in-app purchases. It led to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-vs-apple-became-the-internets-trial">heavily followed antitrust trial in 2021</a>, with the legal battle <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-scores-another-win-in-epic-antitrust-dispute">continuing over the years</a>. </p><p>Epic's case could be one of the first to demonstrate how Apple and other major companies affected by the DMA deal with the regulations. In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eu-dma-investigation-apple-meta-google">EU regulators opened an investigation</a> into Apple, Google, and Meta over non-compliance with the DMA policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apple-may-face-charges-in-eu-under-the-digital-markets-act">with it being revealed in June</a> that Apple could be the first company to face charges over it. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Regular viewers of Games Done Quick are probably familiar with Peanut Butter the dog, a Shiba Inu who has been trained by his owner, JSR_, to play older video games in return for treats and praise. For a canine, Peanut Butter's gaming skills are impressive even though he's largely following his owner's lead. But in this year's Summer Games Done Quick, Peanut Butter may have delivered the highlight of the annual event by hitting a walk-off home run to win the game.</p><p>Peanut Butter was playing the SNES classic, Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball, in a game that was tied 3-3 in extra innings. And at just under 30 minutes into the game, Peanut Butter nailed a two-run homer to win with a 5-3 score. The clip posted above only features Peanut Butter's last-second heroics. His entire game is featured in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2FZKJ4QBdA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/m2FZKJ4QBdA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peanut-butter-pup-how-agdqs-top-actual-dog-became-an-expert-gamer/1100-6520543/" data-ref-id="1100-6520543">GameSpot interviewed JSR_</a> in order to get some insight on how Peanut Butter became perhaps one of the first video-game-playing dogs. It took months of training, but Peanut Butter was a dedicated learner and a very good boy throughout the process.</p><p>"Within the first day of training, he could press the button on command," recalled JSR_ . "What was hard was getting him to not only be attentive for 20-25 minutes without stopping, but to press the button down and hold it until I released him."</p><p>Peanut Butter's time with Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball was just one of this year's <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summer Games Done Quick charitable speed runs</a>, which has already raised over $1 million for Doctors Without Borders. But we'd be surprised if any gaming moment at this year's event tops seeing Peanut Butter hit that game-winning home run.</p>

When they were first offered, it was as a choice between two stratagems: either the mines or a rocket launcher. Players had to choose between the liberation of two planets, which correspond to one of the stratagems, and whichever was freed first awarded its weaponry. The rocket launcher won and the mines were shelved till the next major order. </p><p>A little later down the line, the community was tasked with the even larger major order with the goal of killing two billion Automatons—one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s enemy factions, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">particularly brutal one to fight</a></span>. As a reward for completing the major order, players were offered a second chance at the anti-tank mines. This time around, the <em>Helldivers 2 </em>player base fell short of the goal, though it’s unclear whether it was due to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-player-count-down-failing-major-orders-1851500257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-player-count-down-failing-major-orders-1851500257">dwindling numbers</a></span>, lack of interest in the reward, simply coming up short against such a tall order, or some mix of all these forces.</p><p> Last month, Arrowhead once again offered the mines as a choice between two outcomes: <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players were placed in their very own trolley problem and forced to pick between saving the literal children of Super Earth or a factory that’d manufacture the mines. The community picked the kids.</p><p>Which brings us to the present major order and its pretty simple goal: the liberation and defense of the planet X-45. It’s so straightforward that the major order has already been completed with days left on the timer. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>players fear there’s an ulterior motive behind the defense of X-45, though. You see, most major orders are clear about the rewards that’ll be handed out upon completion, but the current one mostly obscures that fact.</p><p>Instead, this major order’s reward has been referred to most often as “weaponry from the First Galactic War.” At first, players suspected this might be the return of a weapon from the original <em>Helldivers</em>, which could still be the case. That notion hasn’t completely swayed the conspiratorial sort, who are now utterly convinced that this is Arrowhead’s (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-galactic-war-game-master-joel-1851297376">and specifically Joel’s</a></span>) way of tricking players into <em>finally </em>unlocking the mines.</p><p>Folks in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit, have been popping off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvpefx/arrowhead_after_the_last_time_we_failed_to_get/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvpefx/arrowhead_after_the_last_time_we_failed_to_get/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts joking about the conspiracy</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvj5pn/its_trap_retreat_retreat_they_want_to_give_us_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dvj5pn/its_trap_retreat_retreat_they_want_to_give_us_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post</a></span> is, in all caps, titled, “ITS TRAP.

I’m kind of inclined to believe them and here’s why.</p><p>Mines aren’t as sexy as a new gun, which makes sense why players aren’t too keen on getting them. The order to kill two billion automatons was poorly timed, seeing as how the game was still recovering from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN kerfuffle</a></span> that nearly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-playstation-live-service-pc-games-1851458983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-playstation-live-service-pc-games-1851458983">cost it and Arrowhead their respective good reputations</a></span>, and was suffering from lower playcounts than usual. The trolley problem seemed to be poking fun at the mines’ unique situation, but also seemed like a tacit admission from the developers that it was an unpopular choice. How <em>else</em> could the developers get these tools into our hands outside<em> </em>of outright tricking us into earning them? It’s like hiding a dog’s medication in their food.</p><p>X-45 has become a popular planet since Arrowhead rolled out the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-jungle-biome-reactions-1851553947&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-jungle-biome-reactions-1851553947">new jungle biome</a></span>. Players have already been flocking to any planet rocking the new look, so why not place a major order there to ensure that the bulk of the active player base is supporting the completion of the major order? Besides that, most major orders have been more drawn-out affairs split across the defense or liberation of several planets. In the case of this one though, we literally just need to hold one planet, and everyone’s already there. It’s no wonder that there are still 3 days to complete the goal and it’s already done.</p><p>I don’t know what to believe at this point, but I do know that it’d be really fucking funny for Arrowhead to have duped its community into backing this effort just to give them the mines. I’m on my knees literally praying that next week rolls around and we’ve all got them unlocked. It’d make my entire life.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m a couple hours in myself and not regretting it. </p><p>The real question facing prospective <em>Daybreak </em>players, as with almost every <em>Trails</em> game, isn’t whether it’s worth playing, but whether it’s a worthy starting point. It’s the 11th main game in the series, which is itself technically a subseries of Falcom’s <em>The Legend of Heroes </em>games. For that reason, in addition to the fact that, until recently, some key games hadn’t ever been localized, it’s always been incredibly confusing for outsiders to wrap their heads around how each sequel relates to one another and the best order to play them in, a challenge former <em>Kotaku</em> editor Jason Schreier <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-into-trails-one-of-the-best-rpg-series-out-1786275078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-get-into-trails-one-of-the-best-rpg-series-out-1786275078">tried to tackle nearly a decade ago</a></span>. </p><p>In the years since, Falcom has finally brought overseas players up to speed with a steady drumbeat of ports, localizations, and new releases. But this also meant that every time a new<em> Trails </em>game arrived, uninitiated RPG fans would often go from “oh neat!” to “oh, oh god...” In part, that’s because diehard <em>Trails</em> fans will always tell you to start at the beginning with 2004's <em>Trails in the Sky. </em>There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/16pdzd2/charting_the_trails_should_you_start_with_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/16pdzd2/charting_the_trails_should_you_start_with_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">payoffs and reveals</a></span> that players will miss if they jump past it. That game originally made its way west on PSP before getting a Steam version in 2014. But unfortunately there’s no modern way to officially play it on console unless you want to spend over $100 on a used copy. </p><p>More importantly, starting at the beginning means playing all 10 games that preceded <em>Daybreak</em>. The <em>Trails in the Sky </em>trilogy contains two other games, <em>Trails in the Sky SC </em>and <em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd,</em> both of which are also exclusive to PC among modern platforms and take a collective<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=trails%2520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/?q=trails%2520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> estimated 120 hours to complete between them</a></span>. Then there is the Crossbell saga, which consists of <em>Trails from Zero </em>and <em>Trails to Azure</em>. Despite originally coming out over a decade ago, both were recently ported to PS4 and Switch in addition to PC. Combined, that’s another 80 hours of playtime. </p><p>Finally, you have the <em>Cold Steel </em>games, which build on the worlds, characters, and conflicts of the previous games in a five-game arc that wraps up with <em>Trails of Reverie</em>. The first two games are only available on PS4 and PC. <em>Cold Steel III</em>, <em>IV</em>, and <em>Reverie</em> are also on Switch. For these games you’re talking roughly another 250 hours. If you’re looking to go on an epic RPG adventure whose deep worldbuilding and character arcs grow across several games, well, you’re in luck! But if that’s you, then you probably already decided to dive into <em>Trails</em> long ago. And even if you don’t feel the need to start all the way at the beginning, telling someone to play five games before starting <em>Daybreak </em>is still a tall order. </p><p> I’m someone who’s dabbled in a handful of<em> Trails</em> games over the years just to see what all the fuss was about but never got deep into any of them, let alone finished a complete arc. If you’re like me, desperate to become <em>Trails</em>-pilled but short on time, <em>Daybreak</em> might be your savior. It’s the start of a completely new storyline that, while it weaves in past history and pivotal moments, isn’t going to bog you down with the guilt of coming into a messy drama in the third act. Even better, there’s a free demo on PlayStation and Switch if you want to test it out before committing.</p><p>  <em>Trails Through Daybreak II</em>, meanwhile, has been out in Japan since 2022 and will likely get ported west next year or the year after. Then there’s <em>Kai no Kiseki</em>, the latest game in the <em>Trails</em> series and the third game following the exploits of Van Arkride. There’s no formal release date yet, but it’s supposed to come out in Japan before the end of 2024. For now it seems like U.S. players will be waiting until 2026 or beyond for that one, plenty of time for <em>Daybreak </em>converts to dig back through the rest of the series. And by plenty of time, I mean just enough if you spend at least 45 minutes a day playing<em> Trails</em> from now until then. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>I love the episodic storytelling used in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>--it's a big reason why I'm still logging into the game every week after five years. How developer Respawn has told this story has changed numerous times since 2019, ranging from social media posts and evolving in-match quips to datamining bamboozles and a YouTube miniseries. The battle royale's story is always changing and evolving in both how it's told and what it's focusing on, shifting most recently by killing off a long-standing major villain who worked outside of the Apex Games and introducing a brand-new baddie who's actually competing against the legends in the arena, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-season-21-alter-was-not-easy-to-add/1100-6523141/">Alter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The lore is ever-growing as each new season brings with it new characters, locations, or storylines, becoming harder for new players to grasp what's going on. As a player looking at it from the outside, writing for any live-service game seems like a Sisyphean task--like the game itself, the story has to just keep going and presumably the narrative as a whole becomes increasingly unwieldy. Having to tell an endless story is at odds with how storytelling traditionally works in practically every medium, and there's the added complexity of needing such a story to evolve in a way that supports the ongoing development of a video game and any changes in its mechanics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Double Take Collection Event Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To better grasp what it's like to put a story like Apex Legends' together, I spoke with lead writer Ashley Reed. We talked about how Season 13's Newcastle was originally planned for Season 7, how lucky happenstance plays a huge part in telling the game's story, and how--at one point--the plan was for Apex Legends to get multiple new legends per season.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When it comes to writing Apex Legends, how far ahead are y'all? Are there efforts to not have too much of each season's story pre-written or does that not matter much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There's layers to it. There's--I almost want to call it the meta layer--the layer that may never exist. The layer where, when we create our characters, we're like, "Okay, this is this person, and in a traditional story, what is their arc?" Because that helps determine what this character wants, and what this character does not have. And that's what makes them interesting. For most of the characters, we have an idea of, if we were to snap our fingers and do the movie version, how [their story] would end. But that can transform over time because [a live-service game] is a living, breathing thing, and a lot of those endpoints have changed pretty significantly over time. A couple of them have already happened, like Pathfinder's endpoint happened when he found his creators. So now he has a new adventure to go on.</p><p dir="ltr">So there's that level, and then we will start integrating fairly early with the content in new seasons. We usually know about a year in advance the gist of what a season is going to be, so we'll start engaging with that like, "Okay, what's the narrative that can go with this thing that you're working on? Does it need a narrative? Does it fit with this aspect of the universe? Could one of the existing characters be an announcer for whatever this is?" We don't like waiting until the season before because then it feels very rushed and our timelines for recording dialogue are actually quite long. I think I can say this. I think it's okay. Right now, we are finishing dialogue for Season 23.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329265" data-ratio="0.54248810333107" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329265"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329265-s5_loba2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Oh, wow. And we're still in the middle of Season 21 right now.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. So we have to know exactly what the characters are going to need to say now. It was a couple of weeks ago when we started writing it. So we don't want to wait until too far after this at all. We'd really like to have some idea of what we're doing with the story before that. But because we know where we've been, we know where we're going, and we can have the scaffolding in place for the general gist of what the story's going to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still using this wrong, but the meta narrative level is really helpful because we'll know the trajectory for a character or a place or something like that. And then as new information is introduced, we're like, "Oh, that fits. That happens to work." We have this thing internally that we call "seamless storytelling," which means something happened by happenstance that fits perfectly with something we wrote before and we're like, "Nailed it." Actually, a funny story: We were working on Catalyst--the personality, the proclivities, and the interesting crystals and all that--and it just so happens, completely separately, the map design team was working on a moon map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Wait, so Catalyst and Broken Moon--despite seemingly being built in tandem and narratively fitting together perfectly--were each designed separately? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are times like that where it's an amazing happy accident. But I will say, like Edna from The Incredibles, "Luck favors the prepared." If you've got an eye out for that stuff, you can grab onto it and move by.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329266"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329266-s15_catalyst.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did the shift in Apex Legends' content pipeline affect the writing process for legends and the story overall? Y'all used to have to get a new legend ready to go with a story and everything every season, and a brand-new map every four seasons.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's true, we did. And it's funny because you probably would've thought it was solely a team health measure because maps and legends are our highest lift--they take a very long time to do. I think conservatively, each legend from their very, very starting point to launch is a year at least of really consistent work. Same with maps. Maps take a full year to do. So they are a very heavy lift and we love them, we love working on them, but that cadence was very difficult. There was a dream when Apex first launched to actually release new legends more frequently.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>More </strong></em><strong>frequently? Do y'all hate yourselves?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Oh, very quickly we figured out that nope, nope, nope--not going to be possible to do it to the level that we were happy with. That was becoming so much of a grind that as much as we loved, it risked burning people out. So [team health] was one of the measures. But also we did start to see--and I'm no expert in this--but around Season 12, people actually being like, "Oh my God, stop adding characters." When Mad Maggie showed up, they were like, "I am having trouble keeping up with the constant changes to the meta in this game because the new characters keep getting added." So we actually got feedback that people were like, "Stop adding people." We're like, "Oh, okay, okay." So from a storytelling perspective, the characters and maps are obviously a very easy thing to hang your hat on. They're the center of everything at that point because they're very new, very big, very heavy in content and there's a lot you can do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">So doing them less is a loss, but at the same time, it can be a bit of a crutch because the same way people are saying, "Hey, I'm having trouble keeping track of the game because there are so many new characters," there's also, "Well, what about my fave? You haven't done content for my fave in a long time," which we'll acknowledge. We're like, "Oh God, so-and-so hasn't gotten any new stories." So it gives us time to actually sit with the existing characters and do more with them. And obviously we still want to keep adding new characters, but we don't want to abandon the characters that people already love and really identify with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329267" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329267"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329267-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I am, in fact, one of those players. Please refocus the story back on Vantage. Not so that we learn more about her--she's great and all--but so that her mom comes back into the spotlight. </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hot-drop-apex-legends-has-made-vantage-mom-too-interesting-i-want-to-play-her/1100-6505989/"><strong>I really want to know more about Vantage's mom</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I like that you love her because that's, I would say, one of our biggest difficulties. We do want the characters to have lives outside the [Apex Games]. But there's a not insignificant portion of the fan base who don't consume additional content--and that's fine--but then they get in and they're like, "Who are they talking about?" The only relationships they're aware of are between the characters. And we're like, "We don't want to just have characters who only interact with each other and have no work-life balance, but what is that happy medium of not emphasizing outside characters too much so if you just play the game, you still get the experience, and everybody feels fully fleshed out?" But I do appreciate that you like the NPCs because it's very easy for us to not focus on them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Though, sometimes when y'all do, it's to really bamboozle us. Like when Bangalore started really coming back into the spotlight after Season 9 and it gives us a chance to learn more about Jackson. And then a few seasons later, you're like, "Haha, got you! He's a playable character now named Newcastle."</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I thought we were almost overplaying our hand on it. I'm glad we got to do that whole Bangalore story. We were thinking about that pretty hard for a while. God, I think we were talking about Jackson early, but I think there were active efforts to get him in as early as Season 7.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's a lot earlier than Season 13. So why release Horizon, Fuse, Valkyrie, Seer, Ash, and Mad Maggie first if you're trying to get Newcastle in there?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Basically we were looking for a kit that would suit him, and some kits would pop up in playtesting and we were like, "That feels right," but then they would just not play very well, so they went away. But then, finally, in Season 13, we were like, "This is the one. This is the guy." But there were active attempts to get Jackson in there. [His relationship with Bangalore] is too juicy. This relationship is too perfect. There's a few important NPCs that I think would be a struggle to put in. We've said that Horizon would never shoot [her son] Newton. I don't think Ballistic would struggle shooting his son--I think he'd be a little more open to it. Nathan is also a fully grown man who has a bone to pick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329268" data-ratio="0.57264050901379" data-width="1886" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329268"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4329268-s13_newcastle5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You've spoken on this a bit, but when looking at Apex Legends' story, it feels like Seasons 1-7 are pretty heavily focused on the legends interacting with each other in the arena and then Seasons 8-18 shifted focus to follow the legends' lives outside of it. Is the focus of the story going to remain pretty firmly on the legends' lives outside of the arena going forward, or do y'all have plans to shift the perspective again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I don't want to speak too far in the future because obviously anything can change. I really love the IP, so there's a lot that you can do with the IP. Obviously there's been three different games in this space with three wildly different places. So there's a lot that I think can be done in this universe, but for Apex Legends itself, the game, I do think we have interest in shifting back to the in-arena interactions because that's where most people's experience is. It was really cool to be able to look at what the characters' interactions are outside the sphere. And I do think we still want to talk about that to a degree. We do want the characters to feel well-rounded and they've got other things going on because if they're just faceless avatars in this arena, then that's not Apex.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, we have experimented with doing things outside [the Apex Games]--a big bad villain who exists out there and isn't someone who actually fights in the games. But then we realized that wasn't integrating with the actual game that people play. So that's why the change in direction that we're headed, the new thing we want to try out. You can see those ebbs and flows of we did this, now let's try this.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Apex Legends' story has always been told in other mediums--social media, comics, a mobile game for a while--how do y'all keep track of all that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We have a wiki that got built that keeps track of all this information, and we have a lot of internal documents that wiki summarizes. It's good that we have a team because we can reference each other and be like, "Hey, do you remember what this was? Did we say this? Can you triple check the names of all of Bangalore's brothers? Where did we say Xenia was from again?" We will crowdsource the information amongst each other because it is a lot to keep track of, but the wiki and our internal documents make it a little bit easy. But they are huge. We're very careful about triple-checking ourselves to make sure we don't wreck anything.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>This interview was edited for both brevity and readability.</em></p>

                <p>Elden Ring got its latest patch and multiple nerfs have arrived for some of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion's most-powerful weapons. To start, the arcane scaling of the Bloodfiend's Arm has been decreased and the status buildup associated with the weapon's heavy attack was also reduced. Pre-patch, the weapons Lightning Perfume Bottle and Frenzyflame Perfume Bottle occasionally dealt double damage, but that bug has now been repaired.</p><p>There are a few fixes in the patch that make weapons more powerful. The Carian Sorcery Sword got increased Intelligence scaling, but got worse base damage in turn. The patch repairs a bug where enemies would heal after Black Knife Tiche's maximum HP reduction/gradual HP reduction effect wore off.</p><p>The patch notes also address some performance issues, though it may require a little tinkering in your settings. For example, some PC versions might have ray tracing enabled by default. Check your graphics settings to turn it off. On PS5, you can improve the game's frame rate by using "rebuild database" on the PlayStation's safe mode.

I am fascinated by returning to the Thirteenth (the world completely flooded with darkness) and am already deeply in love with Zero—she’s an incredibly compelling character who has somehow made my least favorite villain in the MMO more interesting by association.

However, the final weekend of a GDQ event is usually particularly packed, as the hype builds and the donations start rolling in faster and faster, and this marathon looks to be no different. You can check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the schedule yourself here</a></span>, but let me highlight a few runs that I definitely don’t want to miss. </p><p><em>Mario </em>relay races at GDQs are always a treat, and the one on Friday at 7PM ET should be absolutely bananas. It pits two teams head-to-head in a series of Kaizo levels (fan-made levels that are typically <em>extremely </em>difficult) that the players have never seen before, meaning they’re racing to both understand the demanding challenges before them and how to tackle them, <em>and </em>execute on overcoming those challenges before their rivals on the other team can do so. That’s followed at around 9:15 ET by a quick <em>Ocarina of Time </em>speedrun. <em>OoT </em>is one of the quintessential speedrun games, and seeing all the ways in which it can be broken never ceases to fascinate me. </p><p>Then on Saturday, things enter absolutely must-see territory in my opinion at around 7:10 PM ET, when two of the best <em>Super Metroid </em>players in the world race to see who can beat it first. That’s followed by even more <em>Mario </em>racing with two players racing through a series of troll levels in <em>Mario Maker 2</em>, and then a glitchless run of <em>Elden Ring </em>which should see the game finished in under 90 minutes. Closing things out with vibes that are sure to be warm and cozy, as we give all we can to support the absolutely essential work that Doctors Without Borders is doing, it’s a nice run of last year’s Switch remake of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>.

I’ve honestly forgotten the entire thing, other than a really clear visual memory of the Saudi hotel room. A few years back, I wanted to give it another play, which is how I discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-classic-alpha-protocol-removed-from-sale-on-steam-1835662074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-classic-alpha-protocol-removed-from-sale-on-steam-1835662074">its mysterious absence</a></span>.

I’m amazed how decent the game still looks, especially running at 1440p. It came out in that sweet spot, when ears were <em>almost</em> round, and glasses could sit on a character’s face, rather than be part of it, and that era has lasted nicely. But it is so monstrously unforgiving when it comes to sneaking my way around the mission-based RPG’s enemy bases. This isn’t helped by a really terrible checkpoint save system, where the save points are always right <em>before</em> I have to complete the hacking game to unlock a door that leads to a long corridor, before a ladder that goes down to the crates where the psychic enemy keeps spotting me.</p><p>Still, the acting’s great, and it’s often a lot of fun to approach it like an im-sim and allow chaos to reign when things go wrong, and just try to shoot your way out of trouble. — John Walker</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-recommend-id="image://215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->343 Industries / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-recommend-id="image://215cfb83e1669d8a2b5c07fd0c19d324" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spartans engage in battle to attack and defend a massive robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Enjoy the hell out of Sentry Defense</p><p>So <em>Halo Infinite</em> has an interesting playlist right now: Sentry Defense. And by interesting, I mean pretty friggin’ awesome. It’s a semi PvPvE mode where two large opposing teams each get a pair of “Sentries” to defend. The sentries are a boss from <em>Infinite</em>’s campaign: Adjutant Resolution, an enemy that’s fully capable of doing damage on its own, and requires players to shoot specific parts of it to do damage. It still plays like a PvP game, not terribly dissimilar to something like Capture the Flag, but the added bosses on both ends really mixes things up for the old <em>Halo </em>format.</p><p>Since <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-forge-ai-season-5-multiplayer-bots-1850922553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-forge-ai-season-5-multiplayer-bots-1850922553">the inclusion of campaign bots</a></span> in <em>Halo Infinite</em>’s multiplayer, I’ve mostly played quirky custom games, and the series’ classic “Firefight” wave-based “horde” mode. That’s been fun, naturally, but I’ve been really eager to see what the added functionality of bots in <em>Halo</em> could do, and I’m pleasantly surprised with Sentry Defense.</p><p>Each team getting their own bosses means there’s an added layer of combat you need to bring to your arrival at the enemy base. Or, if you’re running defense, having these bosses capable of dealing lethal damage on their own really changes things up. It’s an added layer of challenge to the already challenging PvP nature of <em>Infinite</em>. I’ve also noticed that players seem to be resorting to vehicles a lot more as a result, perhaps with the hopes of the added firepower making a significant difference when it comes to chipping away at the bosses’ health. Because of that, players need to respond to more frequent vehicle encounters, which in my experience has made defending the base a lot more fun (with way more potential for multi-kills when a crew rolls up with a Warthog). </p><p><br>Sentry Defense is pretty resistant thus far to getting too repetitive. Overall, I’m finding it to be an excellent preview of where <em>Halo</em> can grow…wherever the future is likely to take this 20+ year series. — Claire Jackson  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-recommend-id="image://ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->sunset visitor</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-recommend-id="image://ab4d48b99fcfacab8b5639763de052af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character holds a large knife at someone off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal: </strong>Like games again</p><p>I have a problem where every so often I just get into a rut where I don’t play that many games. Sure, I’ll boot up <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and do my dailies, but broadly, I stop playing most of what passes through the public consciousness. Part of it is growing up and having more responsibilities, but a lot of the time I just can’t muster the willpower to play a game. I make up for it at the end of the year when GOTY lists are coming together, and I’m trying to be better about that right now by playing <em>1000xResist</em>, an adventure game that has come highly recommended by people I respect and trust. Everyone is swearing to me its melancholy, gay as hell sci-fi drama is going to hook me, and even in the first hour, I can see how this might pull me in. Every now and then you need an incredible experience that will remind you why you like video games in the first place. I’m hoping <em>1000xResist </em>can be that for me right now. — Kenneth Shepard</p><hr><p>And that wraps our picks for the weekend. Happy gaming!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You'll also get all cosmetic armor sets for Raiden, including his White, Inferno, Commando, Metal Gear Solid 4, and Cyborg Ninja skins. Additionally, there are options to rewatch all of the game's cutscenes, listen to every codec conversation, and tweak the graphics.</p><p>The game runs just fine on mobile gaming PCs like the ROG Ally, making this a fun title to install and take with you on trips.

                <p>Plain old cobblestone or regular stone are fine building blocks in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a>, but why not add some flair to your next project? Smooth Stone is a variation of stone that unlocks some new recipes as well as looks extremely clean and unique compared to other blocks like it. Below, you can see the whole process of acquiring Smooth Stone and what it can be used for in Minecraft.</p><h2>How to get Smooth Stone in Minecraft</h2><p>Fortunately, Smooth Stone is crafted in a similar way to regular stone. In fact, you need regular stone to make Smooth Stone. For those of you who need a refresher, you make regular stone by following this process:</p><ul><li>Craft a Furnace and place a smelting agent on the bottom box (Coal)</li><li>Then place cobblestone in the top box and it will turn into regular stone</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329257" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329257"></a><figcaption>Making stone in a Furnace</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329257-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.01.19.82.png"></figure><p>Using regular stone, you can follow the same process. This time, however, you need to put the regular stone in the top box and the furnace and coal will turn it into Smooth Stone. Unfortunately, this can take quite a long time, especially if you need large quantities of Smooth Stone.</p><p>My best advice is to craft several Furnaces and place coal/stone in all of them. This speeds up the process tremendously and allows you to make much more of the resource. You can't make Smooth Stone in a Blast Furnace, though, so don't try and use one of those to speed up the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329258" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4329258"></a><figcaption>Turning stone into Smooth Stone</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4329258-minecraftscreenshot2024.07.05-13.00.31.53.png"></figure><h2>Using Smooth Stone in Minecraft</h2><p>Aside from being used as a building block, you can use Smooth Stone for a couple of specific recipes in Minecraft. This includes:</p><ul><li>Blast Furnace</li><li>Smooth Stone Slab</li></ul><p>Smooth Stone is required to make a Blast Furnace, but aside from that, you can simply use it as a building block for your next construction in Minecraft.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> is taking extra steps to crack down on cheaters by offering players a cash bounty - in the extraction shooter’s in-game currency, anyway - for reporting ne’er-do-wells.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The popular shooter has long been waging war against cheaters, naming and shaming thousands of banned players by dropping lists of usernames as proof that “justice has been served”. Even so, cheats remain - developers Battlestate Games said <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1745868257054101741">they banned over 11,000</a> in a matter of weeks earlier this year - so the game’s creators are now introducing the bounty system.</p>
<p>Officially referred to in the game’s <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/303">latest patch notes</a> as “compensation for reporting players who violated game rules”, the bounty system is fairly straightforward in practice. Players who successfully report a cheater - in other words, you can’t just cash in by reporting everyone you see - will receive an amount of in-game money once the cheater is confirmed and banned.</p>
<p>It’s not specified how much money players will receive for their efforts, though dedicated bounty hunters will receive a combined amount for successfully reporting multiple cheaters.</p>
<p>The system is live now alongside latest patch 0.14.9.5, which also adds item wishlists, some tweaks to PMC and Scav AI, and the ability to play its PvE Zone mode offline. You might recall said PvE mode as being at the centre of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-escape-from-tarkov-pve-mode-exclusive-to-pricey-unheard-edition-despite-promises-of-free-dlc">a player backlash to a new $250 edition of Escape from Tarkov revealed in April</a>, to which it was exclusive despite a past top-tier version of the game promising that all future DLC would be included for free. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-studio-head-doubles-down-on-belief-new-mode-is-not-dlc-but-says-players-can-have-it-when-the-game-is-done">some initial resistance</a>, the studio later relented and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-studio-boss-says-he-did-not-foresee-players-would-get-mad-about-charging-extra-for-pve">allowed owners of the older Edge of Darkness bundle into the PvE mode</a>.</p>

<p>The release date of EA FC 25, the second soccer game from EA Sports since the FIFA license expired, has seemingly been leaked.</p>



<p>According to the reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-vous-devoile-la-date-de-sortie-de-ea-sports-fc-25-54912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun and dealabs</a>, EA FC 25 is set to release on September 27. The game is set to feature a Standard and Ultimate Edition. Those who pre-order the Ultimate Edition will get seven — yes, seven — days of early access. </p>



<p>The Standard Edition of the game will cost $69.99 while the Ultimate Edition retails at $99.99. As usual, EA Play members will get a 10-hour trial of the game during early access.</p>



<p>There have been rumors of various changes coming to modes like Pro Clubs and Ultimate Team. However, Insider Gaming hasn’t been able to verify the rumors based on the source.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 is expected to release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC as well as last gen Xbox One and PlayStation 4.</p>

                <p>Ys X: Nordics launched in Japan last year, and it's finally slated for a stateside launch on <strong>October 25</strong>. The game features a reimagined combat system with naval exploration to provide a change of pace for the long-running series. It earned solid reviews in Japan, and fans of the series should find much to love about this latest installment. Preorders for Ys X: Nordics are live now, and you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Edition for only $60</a> or the <a href="https://store.nisamerica.com/products/ys-x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NIS Online Store-exclusive Limited Edition for $105</a>. Nordics isn't the only game Ys fans have to look forward to. A remastered edition of Ys: The Oath in Felghana (Ys III) will release on modern platforms in early 2025, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-ps5-switch-preorder/1100-6524673/" data-ref-id="1100-6524673">preorders are live now for the limited-edition physical release</a>.</p><hr><p>Ys X: Nordics will be available on PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The Ys series has never been afraid of reinvention, and Nordics is no different in this regard. Ys X will introduce the Cross Action combat system, which allows you to fight using two different styles with the game's pair of playable characters, Adol and Karja. As a result of this new system, you won't find the party-based mechanics in Ys X. Story-wise, Ys X is set shortly after the events of Ys II, which makes it a fitting game to play before The Oath in Felghana remaster.</p><div title="6521439 - Ys X: Nordics Preorder Guide" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2268" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6521439 - Ys X: Nordics Preorder Guide" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Preorder Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CW8C82Z1?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Don't let its name fool you--the deluxe edition of Nordics is essentially the same thing as a standard edition for other games.
