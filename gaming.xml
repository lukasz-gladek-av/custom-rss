			<p>The beauty of nature never ceases to enthral us, and while many of its mysteries have been revealed by pesky scientists, that hasn’t diminished its beauty or wonder. Empire of the Ants – based on the Bernard Werber novel of the same name – is the first game to capture that beauty and wonder, bringing the insectoid kingdom to life in a way that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJDlwPZqv28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It will give you some insight into our household that the first few hours of Empire of the Ants were accompanied by hooting, hollering, whistling and gasping. Our now-teenage son has always been fascinated by ants and other bugs and creepy crawlies, and it’s an interest that’s spread throughout the house (at times quite literally when ants have escaped from his ant farm). </p>


<p>Empire of the Ants first and greatest trick is its visuals. Utilising Unreal Engine 5, it is nearly photo-realistic, and the natural landscape of woods and gardens play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created. </p>
<p>The visual magic is enhanced by the audio, in particular the orchestral soundtrack, which lends itself perfectly to magnifying the sense of wonder and drama. It’s particularly high-quality, making Empire of the Ants feel as much like an animated film or an Attenborough documentary as it does a video game. </p>


<p>You play sister ant 103,683rd – I didn’t know that all ants are female prior to playing, and that was only the first of many things I learned along the way – and you’re the ant that everyone seems to turn to in times of need. Bel-o-kan, your home colony, is consistently under attack by outside forces, or in need of expanding and protecting its territory, and you are a very singular ant amongst many. </p>
<p>There are different mission types for you to tackle in Empire of the Ants, with platforming and  RTS sections the two main options. The RTS sections see you take command of a small legion of ants. At first, you have access to a couple of units, growing as you progress, and they’re made up of Workers, Gunners and Warriors, alongside different support units, before you start to unlock more powerful variants. There’s a nice combat triangle at work here, with different units strong against different enemy types, and if you want to maximise your efficiency you need to choose the right group for the job, while also thinking about positioning them in the most useful place. </p>
<p>That’s not to say you can’t launch every unit you have at a single one to overpower it, but eventually, you’ll see a clear downside to doing so. Rather than forcing you through a bunch of menus, all of the resource and upgrade tree is centred on your nests, with the UI appearing on the ground within them. You have to directly interact with them, which later on becomes a bit tiresome, but does make you feel an integral part of this ecosystem, and that these are real locations that you can directly affect.</p>

<p>The platforming sections are tricky, particularly if you’re attempting to catch something along the way, but they become easier if you think and behave more like an ant, feeling out your way across leaves and up stems rather than trying to rush across without any thought. They’re very rewarding when you get them right, and I never tired of leaping from rock to rock on my way to the destination, not least because of 103,683rd’s bum wiggling each time you do. </p>
<p>There a few foibles to Empire of the Ants that start to nag the longer you spend with the game. One of them is the visual presentation of the menus and UI, which just feel a little lifeless and low-rent compared to the stunning visuals in-game. The other is controlling your ant, who, as an ant, is capable of sticking to whatever surface they’re walking on. This is great for traversing logs, branches, leaves and trees, but you can often find yourself upside down and turned around, and not quite sure which way is forward or back. You do get better at it, but it never completely goes away. Fortunately, neither of these things is a dealbreaker. </p>
<p>Empire of the Ants is largely a very tranquil game, punctuated by the more action-packed RTS sections. It’s often just you and nature, with the gentle music being replaced by the sounds of crickets and distant birdsong. I don’t think it’ll be for everyone, but I really enjoyed each section’s alternating atmosphere. That said, it doesn’t hold your hand, so you’re often left to explore and figure things out for yourself, which is actually refereshing. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big sales barrier just a few months before the sequel is due to launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has sold eight million copies since launching back in 2018, which works out at more than a million copies a year (on average, at least; the studio doesn't break down when those sales occurred, of course).</p>

<p>This also means&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell around two million copies in around nine months; back in February, it was announced that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">crossed the six million mark</a>. Looks like Warhorse's RPG really is a steady seller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=Xx-RyetO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=4wRzL0CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>are (kingdom) coming along nicely.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s new sales milestone arrives as Warhorse gears up to release the sequel, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">announced back in April this year</a>&nbsp;(after being ignominiously and accidentally leaked by IGN, that is).</p>

<p>Originally due to arrive this year,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will instead be launching on February 11th; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">delayed back in August</a>&nbsp;owing to a need for "a tiny bit more time" on Warhorse's part.</p>

<p>When it does arrive, however,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is promising just as weighty and lengthy an RPG as its predecessor. In late August, it was revealed that the game's script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words">will have over two million words</a>, so if you like a lot of dialogue and text in your RPGs, you're in luck.</p>




<p>As for the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaimed-open-world-rpg-kingdom-come-deliverance-coming-to-nintendo-switch">ported to Nintendo Switch</a> earlier this year, which means it's now possible to play the RPG on all major platforms (and I'd recommend you do so if you want to be fully prepared for the followup).</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA07238_00-KCDGAME010000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance/BNBWFH89FCF1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel is due out on February 11th, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable">our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how it's shaping up.</p>

That’s because people desperately hunting for an EX Charizard or Misty trainer will take any advantage they can get, even if it’s 100 percent made up.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,192995,193974" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The free-to-play mobile <em>Pokémon</em> trading card sim <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837">revolves around opening booster packs</a></span>. Every pack contains five cards, with disclosed odds about what’s likely to drop. A slowpoke or Rattata is many times more likely to appear than a Blastoise or Raichu. The special, more powerful EX cards of existing fan-favorites like Pikachu and an Mewtwo, and alt-art cards with larger illustrations, are especially hard to get. </p><p>But opening each booster pack is more than just a tap on the screen. <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will generate a bunch of booster packs at once in a virtual carousel and let you peruse them at your leisure, flipping them back and forth before you decide to pick one and swipe to rip off the top of the wrapper. That’s where a new mass conspiracy about “wrinkled” packs with “bent” corners comes in. </p><p>The theory took hold shortly after <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s launch on October 30, when viral posts began to claim that opening packs with visual irregularities in their virtual wrappers were giving them outsized numbers of rare and powerful <em>Pokémon</em> cards. Japanese X user Jedis_tm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was the first one I saw</a></span> to begin circulating the idea on October 31, encouraging players to scour their booster pack options for ones with any slight twists, wrinkles, or bent edges in the wrappers when the packs are rotated on their side:</p><p>Jedis_tm wasn’t completely convinced of the alleged discovery. “This may not be a guaranteed hit, so consider yourself lucky if you get it,” they wrote in a follow-up tweet, according to the platform’s translation. Even some who have mocked the idea as obviously bunk have been pulled in by the alluring possibility that maybe, just maybe, it does somehow impact the card pulling odds in their favor. “NVM IT’S NOT EVERY TIME,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another user. “Does seem to drastically increase hit rates though??”</p><p>Even people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the game’s subreddit</a></span> aren’t sure what to believe at the moment. “done it twice and got jack shit both times so idk,” wrote one player. “Definitely a better chance. Got 2 exs out of 4 curved packs,” responded another. Others believe the entire carousel doesn’t matter at all and that the cards in a pack are decided the second it’s selected. One player recently claimed to have seen everything their friend was going to pull <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by checking their Wonder Pick as it was happening</a></span>. </p><p>Anecdotal reports can’t really tell us anything meaningful about statistical probabilities on the whole, but it can activate that little voice in the back of your brain that says, “Well this is obviously completely made up...but what if it isn’t?” I’ve taken to checking every booster pack I open for wrinkles now, and have yet to get any startlingly good pulls that left me convinced it was making a difference. In fact, I’ve personally gotten more EX cards from packs I <em>didn’t</em> check beforehand for bent corners.</p><p>And yet I’m still doing it, because that’s what happens when people’s <em>Pokémon</em> fandom encounters the unintuitive black box of statistical mathematics. Even if there’s no truth to the conspiracy whatsoever, it makes the lizard part of my brain feel better while trying to navigate the whole probability-based encounter. It’s the same reason I still hop over cracks in the sidewalk and still held down the B button while trying to catch Gigantamax in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The first set of new maps coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have been revealed. On Monday morning, the game’s official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1853467391688110288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> channels shared a teaser look at the three new maps coming to Black Ops 6 season 1. </p>



<p>The new maps are Heirloom, Hideout, and Extraction. </p>



<p>All of the maps will be available for 6v6 multiplayer gameplay. Heirloom, however, will also be available for 2v2 combat. More details about the maps will come closer to the start of Season 1, but the teases should give players an idea of what to expect.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 1 will feature new maps, weapons, and other additions for all players. It’s set to kick off on November 14 with a full reveal happening shortly before.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is available now. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review of the game</a>, Grant Taylor-Hill said that “Black Ops 6 feels accommodating to both newcomers and veterans. It’s as typical a multiplayer offering as you can ask for, but you&nbsp;just get it<strong>&nbsp;</strong>so much faster than previous titles.”</p>



<p>Check out the teaser below, and let us know what you think in the comments. You can also take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/call-of-duty.12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>. </p>

        <blockquote><p><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is a casual but challenging cooperative platformer where players must work together to help two cute and funny penguins, Bread and Fred, jump and climb to the top of a snowy mountain. The title has gained a loyal following as much for its ability to reduce friends to a fit of giggles or tears as for its unique gameplay mechanics, adorable characters and friendly NPCs.</p><p>Players steer the penguin pals through an exasperating and sometimes maddening climb that requires precision with every jump. Tethered together, the characters can use their momentum to swing each other onto higher and higher ledges. But forget to anchor and if one falls they will pull the other down with them.</p><p>Solo players make their way up the mountain as Greg, who must use a rock on a rope (named Jeff), instead of a penguin pal, to swing his way uphill.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The question for players is whether those visual upgrades are worth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">the PlayStation 5 Pro</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag</a>. That's why some of the developers behind Spider-Man 2 have contributed to a new video that shows off what the game looks like when run on the more powerful system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAhReCdn5Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kAhReCdn5Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"When players play Marvel Spider-Man 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro, they are playing the quintessential version of the Spider-Man experience on the PlayStation 5," said Insomniac Games creative director Bryan Intihar. As part of the demonstration, Intihar noted that players can send either Spider-Man swinging through New York at 60 frames per second without losing the clarity of graphics from the game's fidelity mode.</p><p>Senior art director Jacinda Chew added that Spider-Man 2 is filled with reflective surfaces, from water to the skyscraper windows, and even Spider-Man's goggles. Those are details that could easily be overlooked considering how much is happening on screen at any given moment in the game. With PS5 Pro, those reflections are much easier to notice and appreciate.</p><p>That still might not be enough to convince some players to make the leap to Sony's mid-generation update. But as far as Intihar is concerned, he's happy that players get to have the choice of how they want to play Spider-Man 2.</p><p>PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-overdesign-trap-of-game-design.1027062/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-overdesign-trap-of-game-design<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve played plenty of videogames at this point, and when it comes to originality in design, you can find that in the indie space, especially from first-time developers. The thought of being the first one to create X or take genre Y in a new direction is a promising concept and goal for many designers. However, it does represent one of the easiest traps you can fall into as a developer; new or veteran, when you overdesign a concept.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making a Triangle Wheel"><span>Making a Triangle Wheel</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I talk about overdesign, there are two distinct areas that designers will focus on. The first is doing something completely out of left field with a genre in order to distinguish it from everything else. I’ve said this line before — originality for the sake of being original. Game genres no matter which ones we’re talking about have foundational elements to them — a platformer is about jumping or some kind of motions, shooters are about shooting (duh), and we can keep going. There are elements you can bend to create a different spin, but there are some that you can’t break without breaking the concept of the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If I say that I’m making a first-person shooter, and the focus is on flying around collecting gems in first-person, then I didn’t make an FPS. Many games have tried to do the “my game is a combination of genre A and genre B” style of design. They often don’t realize that you’re not making a game for fans of A and B,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>but of A+B</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and that is an entirely different audience.</span></p><p>Metaphor’s subtle brilliance is streamlining and making SMT’s gameplay and JRPG design as approachable as possible (source steam)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You cannot work in a genre that you don’t understand, and why I harp on designers to play as many examples of a genre that they can find; all the good, and all the bad. Remember, complexity is different from depth — having a complex game does not mean it’s a deep one. Some of the best games released in 2024 have been those that figured out how to sell either a simple idea or a game that looks simple but there is way more going on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a very hard line to walk as a developer, especially a new one, trying to create something original, but still having to color within the lines in a manner of speaking.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="K.I.S.S. Design"><span>K.I.S.S. Design</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other way developers can overcomplicate their games is a literal example — taking something that is simple and easy to play and just throwing more and more on top of that. A good example of this I’ve seen is with the evolution of action commands in games. The action command, which the first case I can think of is from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario RPG</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a way of providing more interactivity in turn-based combat. The benefits of it was to give the player the opportunity to reduce incoming damage and increase the damage they do to speed up combat.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f9CLywUOprk" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What I’ve seen from indie developers has been trying to elevate action commands and turn-based combat as a whole by making it more involved — adding in more systems and interactions during a fight. When I checked out games like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keylocker</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and Ikenfell, they’re both very charming games that have horrible churn rates from the people who played them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the harshest lessons designers must learn is that more is not always better in the consumers’ eyes. A bane of good UI/UX are repetitive actions — something that the player has to be doing constantly in order to play a game. Having one heavily involved fight is fine; having every random encounter balloon out because of these mechanics is not. There should be a reward for figuring out a game, and just being able to play it normally doesn’t count.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ve said this before and I’m saying it again: depth is not the same as complexity. If something takes five minutes to work vs. something that takes one, people are going to prefer the speedier option. To compare designs, when I tried out the demo for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a lot was done to speed up the press turn combat of the game and even reward the player for finishing fights without taking damage. The difference between&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and the other RPGs is that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metaphor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;wants the player to get through combat as quickly as possible while retaining the depth of its design. The other RPGs create depth by slowing it down without providing anything else as a benefit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the past, I’ve talked about when complexity can work with the concept of “good jank” such as in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Getting Over It</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. There are some surprisingly satisfying games that are about taking something further than what other games would have done, such as&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. What’s important to understand is that even if you are going for an involved experience, playing the game itself should not be hard to do. Good jank relies on only one part of your gameplay to be janky, if your entire game is hard to control or confusing, then you missed the mark.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing Design"><span>Balancing Design</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Great game design is often hard to land on for designers. There is always that allure to “go big” with your idea — create something no one has ever seen before that will earn you fame and fortune. When we talk about sustainable game design, that means knowing what you are capable of and building a game around that. The period in which designers could spend 5–10 years on a single dream project are behind us I’m afraid. Likewise, someone spending hours on a game to then decide if it’s for them are also gone. At most, you have the 2-hour period for a refund; at minimum, within 5–10 minutes of starting your game.</span></p><p>Balatro is proof that it’s better to provide depth under the surface of your game rather than hit the player all at once with it (source: Author)</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The game industry continues to move fast and genres that are intentionally slow to play are finding themselves with a smaller and smaller consumer base. The fans are still there, but you can’t just throw money at a genre to create more of a fanbase. Speaking of the fans, this is also why playtesting is important when you are experimenting with something new because in the end, it doesn’t matter if you love your idea and think it’s perfect, when no one else can figure out how to play your game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> won't just look like a modern game, but it will also play as one without taking away what makes the original unique, according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p>Speaking with Play magazine, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-dev-says-that-konami-wants-to-make-the-remake-feel-familiar-but-not-old-our-whole-goal-is-to-make-sure-that-it-still-feels-like-the-game-that-you-played-20-years-ago/">GamesRadar</a>, the series producer commented on the remake, saying that their whole game while remaking the third entry in the popular stealth series was to make sure it still felt like the original game without making it feel like an old game. Modernizing gameplay was also somewhat forced by the improved visuals, as some of the original gameplay elements did not fit well with the remade graphics.</p>
<p>The new control scheme featured in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater plays a rather important role in this regard, giving players the chance to experience the game like never before while allowing users to also experience the remake as if it were the original. Any other change was deemed unnecessary, as it would have taken people out of the original experience. The best outcome for the remake, according to Okamura-san, is for long-time fans to still feel nostalgic while playing it.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is still scheduled for a 2024 release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, although at this point, it's clear the game will not be released this year. We will keep you updated as soon as possible on when the game launches, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

Digital Foundry notes that the power consumption is up from the 340W-rated base PS5, meaning the console might be a bit of a power hog. We’ll see how efficiency settings salvage people’s energy bills. It also points out that the 16.7 teraflops is lower than previous leaks, while the addition of 2GB RAM is higher. Ultimately, the devil will be in how well the PS5 Pro can leverage a custom configuration and new PSSR upscaling tech to deliver results above and beyond what an off-the-shelf PC is capable of at a similar price point. </p><p>Sony, meanwhile, finally gave the full list of over 50 games that PS5 Pro owners will be able to checkout at launch and see these beefier specs and upscaling in action.

It’s possible many of the above games will see their improvements begin rolling out in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, even regular games should get some overall performance stability boosts from the more powerful PS5 Pro hardware. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement came in the same breath that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Sony announced a PC version of Spider-Man 2</u></a> launches in January — one of the quickest turnarounds from single-player PS5 exclusive to PC from the company so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review"><u>Spider-Man 2 review</u></a> returned an 8/10.

While Insomniac has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Wolverine game</u></a> in the works, fans are hoping the developer will also release a Marvel’s Spider-Man spinoff similar in scope to the hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales"><u>Miles Morales standalone</u></a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-todd-tells-fans-insomniac-used-only-10-of-his-venom-dialogue-in-marvels-spider-man-2"><u>Venom the potential focus</u></a>.

Taking inspiration from the Dark Souls games, it tells the story of fabled Dark Crusaders who must embark on an epic quest to overthrow Adyr, the demon God.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our 8/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-review-2023"><u>Lords of the Fallen review</u></a>, IGN said: "Lords of the Fallen is an awesome Soulslike with a fantastic dual-realities premise, even when performance shortcomings and wimpy bosses crash the party."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lords of the Fallen Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Hexworks also added a “more exploration-friendly” Umbral realm with update 1.6, as well as enhancements to take advantage of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which comes out November 7. Patch notes are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexworks said Lords of the Fallen on PS5 Pro has a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode running at 4K60 based on 1440p, and Quality Mode running at a native 4K30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>With version 1.6, new Lords of the Fallen players are more empowered on their journey across Mournstead, with a series of changes during the early part of the game. These include a more gradual onboarding into the Umbral Lamp’s unique abilities, and improved navigation in the tutorial area.<br>As for the wider community, a highly-sought player request has been the ability to more thoroughly explore Umbral – the game’s secondary, darker realm that runs alongside its core world. While retaining its dark allure and tension, the changes – which include subtler soundscapes, an adjusted enemy spawn curve for improved pacing, and reduced vignette effect - all combine to better support exploration of the Umbral.<br>Rounding off the update is a raft of additional performance updates and further difficulty adjustments, including mob redistribution, adjusted ranged enemy perception, and improved platforming. Full patch notes are available to read.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Lords of the Fallen Update v.1.6.12 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented further gameplay adjustments informed by community feedback and extensive playtesting. It’s rewarding to see our Steam ‘Recent Review’ score rising, reflecting the positive impact of these ongoing improvements, and we’re committed to continuing this journey with your valuable input.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mob Density:</strong> Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed via NG+ modifiers.)</li><li><strong>Ranged Enemies:</strong> We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li><li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li><li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics, particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li><li><strong>Attack Displacement:</strong> Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and supporting your playstyle.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Enhanced Tutorialisation, Onboarding, and Start-Up Experience</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve taken steps to further enrich the onboarding experience for new players in Lords of the Fallen, building on feedback from our veteran Lampbearers. We want every new player to feel empowered on their journey, and we understand that some early tutorials may have presented a steep learning curve. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved Lighting in the Defiled Sepulchre:</strong> Enhanced lighting and visual adjustments make this initial tutorial area clearer and easier to navigate.</li><li><strong>Gradual Umbral Tutorialization:</strong> Core abilities like ‘soulflay’ and ‘syphoning’ now have dedicated tutorial spaces later in Redcopse, allowing new players to engage with each feature more gradually.</li><li><strong>Simplified First Jump Tutorial:</strong> We’ve refined the jump tutorial to be more accessible (hands up in the comments if you cleared it on the first attempt!).</li><li><strong>Lightreaper Boss Adjustment in NG0:</strong> To clarify the intentional design of this encounter, we’ve removed the Lightreaper boss fight from the tutorial area for NG0 players. Rest assured: the Lightreaper still lurks within Mournstead and will make a return as a surprise in NG+.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A More Immersive Umbral Realm for Explorers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbral, the parallel realm intertwined with the living world of Axiom, is accessible at any point in the game, offering an expansive world of alternate pathways, hidden treasures, and secrets. We know how much you enjoy exploring Mournstead, and many of you have asked for a more exploration-friendly Umbral realm. Embracing this idea, we’ve made some tweaks to enhance its immersive vibe while preserving its mysterious, challenging nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Umbral remains intentionally hostile, we’ve made adjustments to its sounds, visuals, and enemy spawn curve. Now, the threads (Umbral natives) are slower to detect your presence, allowing you some precious time to explore before the realm’s haunting intensifies. Eventually, the Scarlet Shadow will appear, forcing you to decide: escape or engage in an epic showdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes make Umbral better suited for exploration while preserving its eerie intensity and challenging atmosphere:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dynamic Ambient Sound:</strong> Initial entry into Umbral is now accompanied by subtler soundscapes, building in intensity as you remain longer, reaching a crescendo before you must find an exit, or risk facing the Crimson Reaper.</li><li><strong>Adjusted Enemy Spawn Curve:</strong> Enemy appearances are now better paced to create a smoother, gradual build-up of tension.</li><li><strong>Increased Delay for Scarlet Shadow:</strong> You’ll now have more time to explore before the Scarlet Shadow emerges, enhancing the suspense.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vignette Effect:</strong> Based on player feedback, the vignette effect has been softened to improve visibility while exploring Umbral.</li><li><strong>Clearer Umbral Eggs:</strong> We’ve added a special VFX to eggs set to spawn Umbral natives, as we noticed some players had difficulty distinguishing between active and inactive ones.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">These updates create a richer exploration experience within Umbral, preserving its dark allure and escalating tension for daring adventurers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented additional performance enhancements across several of the game’s more graphically demanding areas, optimising the experience for players with lower-spec computers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Challengers Incoming!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Lords of the Fallen now fully harnessing the power of the PS5 Pro, prepare for a fresh wave of cross-players venturing into Mournstead! Be sure to welcome them - whether with a warm salute in co-op or the cold edge of your blade in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside ongoing support for Lords of the Fallen, Hexworks is working on a sequel due for release at some point in 2026. Publisher CI Games has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-2-enters-full-development-as-ci-games-reveals-new-details">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> (for lack of an official name) will have a "more commercial" art style and narrative, suggesting it wants the game to have more mainstream appeal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CI Games also promised gameplay improvements, more game mode options, and full "shared-progression" co-op alongside the "core" single-player campaign, all developed with "elevated production values" fueled by Unreal Engine 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher confirmed it had received a "major investment" from Epic Games for PC exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, which means Lords of the Fallen 2 will not initially launch on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A group of Monkey Island fans have come together to create their own, mini point-and-click adventure game based on Monkey Island series.</p>
<p>It is called The Booze of Monkey Island, and project developer Bean Adventure Agency describes it as a "love letter" to the official Monkey Island games. Once again, players are popped into the shoes of Mighty Pirate Guybrush Threepwood, and once again, his love Elaine has fallen afoul of LeChuck. These are characters originally created by Ron Gilbert, as Booze of Monkey Island's creators acknowledge in the opening credits.</p>
<p>The game starts with Guybrush in a destroyed ship, with a comatose pirate and a lot of debris standing between him and the way out. Of course, this being a homage to the point-and-click Monkey Island games, Guybrush can use objects around him to puzzle his way out of the ship, and onto the relative safety of Booty Island. Here, he makes a deal with the local bartender: convince three more patrons to frequent his bar, and he will help get Guybrush's  ship seaworthy.</p>

<p>I have played through the first few puzzle sections - which I won't spoil here in case you fancy taking your own dive back into the depths of the Caribbean - but I will say this: it is a pretty slick little fan-made project for fellow Monkey Island fans. It boasts fun dialogue, great graphics and the same atmosphere you would expect from an official game from Gilbert and company.</p><p>Along with familiar locales, such as the Governor's Mansion, players will also come across some familiar faces as they explore Booty Island. This includes Wally and Kate Capsize. Meanwhile, conversations with those on the island reference things that happened in the official Monkey Island games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic and Marvel are coming together, starting with five secret lairs that are releasing in early November. Five iconic Marvel characters are getting unique <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>cards in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Magic: The Gathering Marvel Crossover Details Revealed, Including new Secret Lair and Set">own secret lairs</a>, paired up with reskins or new arts of other cards to complement them.</p>

<p>A Secret Lair gives you some good cards, but we’re going to go through how to build a Marvel MTG deck around the commanders, starting with Captain America, First Avenger</p>

<h3>Examining Captain America, First Avenger</h3>



<p>Our first step is to examine Cap, who is appropriately Red, White, and Blue (in a nice flavor nod, they rearranged the normal order of color display from blue, red, white to fit the traditional America order). He comes with a solid body as a 3 mana 4/4 and has two abilities, in ‘Throw…’ and ‘…Catch’.</p>

<p>Throw… is the more unique ability of the two, letting you unattach an equipment to deal damage equal to the equipment’s mana value divided among up to three targets. Few cards have ever used <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aunattach&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="List of cards that have Unattach in their text">unattach in rules text</a>, and none ever in this way. As for …Catch it is a free equip trigger, letting you give Captain America a piece of equipment at the beginning of combat on your turn at no cost.</p>

<p>What this shows us is a commander who is equipment focused, like any number of Boros commanders. Part of what makes Captain America special is that he adds blue to the mix, opening up new cards for this archetype. Combine that with providing a potentially unique take on the archetype, Captain America, the First Avenger provides an interesting tweak on a well known archetype.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Equipment</h3>



<p>It’s time to suit up Captain America! There are a lot of equipment that can be included but I’m going to focus on a handful that you should look at including in your own Captain America deck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden </a>is from the <em>Assassin’s Creed Universes Beyond </em>set, and is the highest mana value equipment in Magic: The Gathering. It also comes down cheaper based on other historic permanents you control (aka legendary cards, saga’s and artifacts). It is perfect for Captain America, First Avenger to throw, but it’s also good for him to wield in combat as it gives the equipped creature +10/+0 and vigilance.</p>

<p>Sword of War and Peace is an automatic inclusion, in its <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1730/sword-of-war-and-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shield of War and Peace">Shield of War and Peace</a> styling that comes with the secret lair. You’ll probably want to include at least one other <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asword-of-x-and-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Swords of X and Ys">Sword of X and Y</a>, as they are very good. I recommend <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/124/sword-of-feast-and-famine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sword of Feast and Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine</a> in particular as it untapped lands when you deal damage to an opponent, letting you do some more throwing post-combat or cast more spells, and gives protection from green and black.</p>



<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/260/illusionists-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Illusionist's Bracers">Illusionist’s Bracers</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/48/battlemages-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Battlemage's Bracers">Battlemage’s Bracers</a> are for doubling activating abilities. These are helpful for getting more out of Captain’s Throw… ability, making it far more lethal. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/td2/74/grafted-exoskeleton" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Grafted Exoskeleton">Grafted Exoskeleton </a>is a way to turn those throws into extra lethality by making that damage all poisonous, letting only ten damage wipe out a foe - one Excalibur toss becomes lethal.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Support</h3>

<p>To get Captain America to battle takes more than just a few weapons however. Luckily, there’s no lack of support that we can supply for him.</p>



<p>With one piece of equipment we really want in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>, we need quartermaster’s to fetch the goods. That’s why we are looking at tutors like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/31/stoneforge-mystic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Stoneforge Mystic">Stoneforge Mystic</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/230/kellan-the-fae-blooded-birthright-boon" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kellan, the Fae Blooded">Kellan, The Fae-Blooded</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Steelshaper's Gift">Steelshaper’s Gift</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/34/open-the-armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Open the Armory">Open the Armory</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/35/fabricate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabricate">Fabricate</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fighter Class">Fighter Class</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/6/enlightened-tutor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutor</a>. These all can grab Excalibur, or whichever piece of equipment is most useful at any given moment.</p>

<p>For other equipment support we’re looking to a mix of creatures, and enchantments to get extra value, cheapen the cost and return them. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/17/forge-anew" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forge Anew">Forge Anew </a>is a staple of equipment decks for good reason, resurrecting one equipment, giving instant-speed equipping, and giving you a free equip each turn. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a> lets us draw cards for playing them (just like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/88/sram-senior-edificer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sram, Senior Edificer">Sram</a>, who’s also invited to the party), and skip equipment costs as long as we have three or more artifacts.</p>



<p>Reinforcing Captain America, First Avenger we also bring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mul/65/zirda-the-dawnwaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zirda the Dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker </a>to cheapen the cost of his ability, and of all of the equip costs. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/203/ertha-jo-frontier-mentor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ertha Jo, Frontier mentor">Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor</a> provides another ability doubler, as well as a pair of bodies to pick up dropped equipment. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a> is an under the radar helper as well, as it can freely equip things once a turn, gives Captain America Ward 2, and can tap for two mana to play equipment.</p>

<p>Captain America also needs protection, and for that a mixture of creatures and instants come to mind, in addition to some equipment you can include. In the realm of creature cards, there’s the likes of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/33/skrelv-defector-mite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Skrelv, Defector Mite">Skrelv, Defector Mite</a> (who I prefer here over <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/702/mother-of-runes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mother of Runes">Mother of Runes </a>due to being an artifact, and a legendary creature), and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/669/pippin-guard-of-the-citadel" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pippin, Guard of the Citadel ">Pippin, Guard of the Citadel</a> who can cheaply stop removal spells. A relatively new option is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/240/hydroelectric-specimen-hydroelectric-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hydroelectric Specimen">Hydroelectric Specimen </a>which can redirect a single target spell to itself, and as a modal dual-faced card, is optionally playable as a land instead.</p>



<p>Spellwise we have some counterspells and protection spells. The counterspell suite should look at <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/110/arcane-denial" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Arcane Denial">Arcane Denial</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/114/counterspell" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Counterspell">Counterspell</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/94/fierce-guardianship" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fierce Guardianship">Fierce Guardianship</a>, and the modal card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/241/sink-into-stupor-soporific-springs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sink into Stupor">Sink into Stupor </a>(another bonus land option), though you can modify this for your preferred counterspells, with the focus being stopping spells that can remove Captain America or key equipment. Protection spells should complement that and include options like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/teferis-protection" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Teferi's Protection">Teferi’s Protection</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1728/flawless-maneuver" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flawless Maneuver">Flawless Maneuver</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/37/sejiri-shelter-sejiri-glacier" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sejiri Shelter">Sejiri Shelter</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Deflecting%20Swat" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/214/deflecting-swat">Deflecting Swat</a>.</p>

<p>Using what's above I made an example list, and included a list of later cuts in the maybeboard. Here is <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9743049/captain_america" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Captain America Deck">the list </a>for your use to consider ideas for your own list.</p>

<p>A lot of the options above aren’t necessarily the cheapest so let’s do a quick budget ($2.00 or less) rundown of cards for some areas.</p>

<p>Hopefully all of this helps you build the best Captain America, First Avenger deck to lead against all the challengers you will face.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runemasters-review-punishingly-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is it about sacred temples that make them such juicy targets for roving monsters and villains? That’s a question you… won’t have time to answer in <i>Runemasters</i>, a new <a href="https://funforge.fr/en/products/runemasters">cooperative game by Funforge</a>. I’ve been on a real hot streak reviewing great new board games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y"><i>Chandigarh</i></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/botanicus-review-it-grows-on-you"><i>Botanicus</i></a>, and now the good folks at Flat River Group sent me the slim-but-tricky <i>Runemasters </i>to check out, so follow along for my <i>Runemasters</i> Review!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Runemasters</i>, And How Do You Play<i>?</i></h2>

<p>Designed by Antoine Prono with illustrations by Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez, <i>Runemasters</i> is a cooperative tower defense game for 1 - 4 players, where players take on the role of guardians protecting a temple from hordes of enemies. Each of the four guardians has a different distinct special ability and ultimate power, which you’ll need to use against the incoming threat.</p>

<p>And believe me, that threat will, indeed, be incoming! One of the things I find most interesting about <i>Runemasters </i>is that it is, quite simply put, extremely punishing. I feel like many cooperative games, over the past five years or so, have softened their difficulty levels. This makes sense when so many of them are more narratively driven, inviting users to explore a world and story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=CikAl8Pi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=gRAE-BMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each hero brings unique skills to the table... will they be enough?</figcaption></figure><p>But sometimes you just want to bash your head against a wall in a coop game that’ll leave your gaming group in shambles, like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Spirit Island</i>. <i>Runemasters</i>, I’m happy to report, is a return to that classic form.</p>

<p>In the game, you’ll flip over cards depicting monsters and place them on a colored track that matches their card color. Each turn, they’ll move one space closer to the temple, and automatically deal damage to any hero blocking their path. If no hero’s on the path, they’ll damage the temple. If all your heroes die, or the temple takes too much damage, you lose!</p>

<p>To defeat these monsters, you’ll roll custom six-sided dice. The dice allow you to deal a point of damage to the first enemy in your track if one of their “weak points” matches a symbol you rolled. Or you can use those symbols to power up your ultimate power, perform a special ability, or swap spaces with another guardian.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=ltun32no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=YO5WLgUv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice rolled can be used to damage an enemy's weak spots, move, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Defeat most of the monsters in the stack of monster cards, and you’ll reveal the Dawn card - if you survive with at least one hero still on the board, you win!</p>

<h2>The Pleasure Of Difficulty In <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>Maybe I’m a chronically bad dice roller (FACT), but it was such a challenge to get the right symbols at the right time. There are many clever, interlocking mechanics in this little game that add to your strategic options - you can spend the dice you roll to build a wall, or expend mana points to re-roll dice - but I was still left struggling again and again.</p>

<p>But I want to be clear: <i>this is not a bad thing</i>! Cooperative games in this style have lead to some of the most fun, joyfully anguishing moments in my gaming career, and when we finally did beat the game after multiple tries, we were left feeling utterly triumphant. I really enjoy the way the game doesn’t overload you with options, while still managing to give you a few key tools in your hero’s toolkit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=bGcYfnQL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=L3wS_IGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ismoros's ability to shield heroes from enemies is not to be overlooked.</figcaption></figure><p>The one major downside with <i>Runemasters</i>, however, is also intrinsically tied to the difficulty and design of the game - and that’s player elimination (Boo! Hiss!). In this game, if your hero is killed - that’s it, you’re done! One of the heroes can resurrect other characters twice in the game, but A. that takes a lot of work to build up the magic power to do so and B. if <i>that</i> hero dies, there’s no resurrection happening.</p>

<p>I would like to see a mechanic where you come back after you die, but suffer some sort of penalty. Even if the penalty imposed made the game equally as hard as losing a character, at least that player wouldn’t have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish the game. In most cooperative games, if your character dies the entire game is a loss (that’s how they do it in the gloriously chunky <i>Cthulhu: Death May Die</i>, which is of course an entirely differently scoped game, but I just played it so it’s fresh in my mind).</p>

<p>The flip side to this, which solves the problem of player death, is that this game can just as easily be played solo mode. You don’t need to make any adjustments, and if one of your characters dies, you’ve still got plenty of game to go!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=anGLWXt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=igqRqZYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We're in big trouble here, we've lost a hero (who would be occupying the yellow space) and monsters are backed up on the green path!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Artwork And Components Of <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>The illustrators Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez have truly outdone themselves with the quirky, angular designs on all of these cards. The heroes look extremely stylized and have a lot of kinetic movement to them, the monsters are all great renderings of classic dungeon threats, and there’s overall a clean, unfussy look to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=cCsQ79ff 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=1xlKmjgp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy cards and event cards show off the distinctive illustrated style of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The components are sturdy cardboard, with all heroes coming as cardboard standees and all villains represented by cards. This isn’t really a game where you need detailed miniatures, and it keeps the price nice and slim at around $30 at most retailers.</p>

<h2><i>Runemasters </i>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that’s going to challenge your gaming group, and love a little slash and dash dice-chucking, you won’t find much better out right now than <i>Runemasters</i>. But be warned, player elimination means that you may be sitting by the wayside while your friends are still in the temple trying to defeat a blue dragon! With superior artwork, clean game design, and a high degree of difficulty, <i>Runemasters</i> is a must-try to brave adventurers out there.</p>

However, once you complete Zelda’s Adventure, you may be wondering what you should dive into next. Here are nine other games that could fill the <em>Zelda-</em>sized hole in your gaming soul.</p></div><div><p>This one is a bit of a gimme, but it’s also the easiest to recommend. If you’re aren’t quite ready to move on from the aesthetic of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> and somehow missed the other 2D <em>Zelda </em>game on the Switch, there really isn’t a title that will satisfy you more than <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. </em>Developed by Grezzo, who also developed <em>Echoes of Wisdom, Link’s Awakening </em>is a remake of the beloved Game Boy game that was originally released in 1993. The 2019 title utilizes an art style that is nearly identical to the most recent entry, so players will feel right at home as they play as Link after he wakes up shipwrecked on a mysterious island.</p><p>Both of these games are similar in that they are fairly different from other Zelda titles. While <em>Link’s Awakening </em>still lets you control Link, meaning combat is pretty traditional, everything else about the game is distinct. With no Zelda that needs rescuing, the game is a little more personal, as Link’s only goal is to gather the tools that will get him home. Those looking for something different in the franchise can’t do much better than <em>Link’s Awakening.</em></p></div><div><p>Zelda wasn’t the only Nintendo princess to get her chance to shine this year, as the publisher also released <em>Princess Peach: Showtime! </em>which gave players the chance to step into the slippers of Mushroom Kingdom royalty.</p><p>While <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> shares a lot of DNA with other entries in the franchise, <em>Showtime!</em> has very little in common with most <em>Mario </em>games. The game sees Peach visit the Sparkle Theater to catch a show, only for a villainous band to take it over. While Mario would solve this problem by jumping on their heads, Peach goes about it her own way, showing off her versatility by dressing up into many different roles, all with their own unique mechanics. Not only is it a strong showing from Peach, but it also constantly switches things up for the player, ensuring they never get bored as they help the iconic princess save the day.</p></div><div><p>Most of <em>Echoes of Wisdom’s </em>combat revolves around creating “Echoes” that will get their hands dirty so you don’t have to. There is another group of Nintendo characters who are accustomed to this method of fighting, the many captains of the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise.</p><p>Much like<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will have you go around gathering minions to help take down enemies and solve puzzles. A major difference between the two, howver, is that while the Echoes are a major point of the former, the Pikmin are almost the entire point of the latter. The player character in <em>Pikmin 4 </em>has no offensive moves to speak of, requiring them to most effectively target enemy weakness with the creatures they have in their arsenal. They also must use strong resource management to ensure they can defeat foes that come their way while maintaining enough manpower (or PikminPower) to overcome numerous obstacles, whether they’re carrying multiple items back to base or creating new pathways. </p><p>If you’re looking for a game that offers something similar to <em>Zelda’s </em>Echoes but pulls it off with more focus, <em>Pikmin 4</em> is a strong candidate.</p></div><div><p>Probably the least popular title on this list, <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is a game that needs a bit of an explanation. The indie released earlier this year sees you take on the role of a little spaceship in a world heavily inspired by the original <em>The Legend of Zelda.</em> Unsurprisingly, controlling a spaceship plays very differently than an elf boy with a sword, which makes <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> an exciting remix of the original NES title. </p><p>Part RPG, part Shoot Em’ Up, <em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>is quite unlike anything else out there. You will literally start with no abilities before quickly picking up a weak gun that offers the smallest bit of protection. As you pick off enemies, you will slowly gain experience, which can then be used to power up everything from your movement speed to damage output. There are also new weapons and abilities that will be acquired as you take on the game’s dungeons, which can then help uncover more secrets scattered around the map.<br></p><p>It’s a fantastic game that scratches that <em>Zelda </em>itch while offering a completely different experience. The one caveat is that currently, it’s only available on Steam, but if you have access to a PC and are looking for something a little different after <em>Echoes of Wisdom, Minishoot’ Adventures </em>should be at the top of the list.</p></div><div><p>In <em>Zelda </em>games, you usually spend just as much time physically fighting enemies as you do mentally trying to overcome the games’ many puzzles. This is a major part of the franchise’s appeal and key to its longevity, but after spending hours thinking through Echoes of Wisdom’s many in-game problems, you may want to give your brain a rest. Luckily, Nintendo has you covered with <em>Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition</em>.</p><p>As this is a Musuo Game, the only thinking you’re doing here is wondering what character you should mow down armies with. If you’re unfamiliar with the genre, <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>has you pick a hero (or villain) from <em>Zelda</em> history and take on countless mobs of enemies. There are no dungeons to explore, or secrets to uncover, only large-scale combat. After you most likely had countless echoes destroyed during your playthrough of <em>Echoes of Wisdom, </em>getting to destroy someone else’s minions will be a nice change of pace. As an added bonus, you can also play as Zelda herself, if her solo outing caused you to fall in love with the character even more.<br></p><p>There is a successor titled <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, but given its ties to the <em>Breath of the Wild </em>timeline, and the original’s focus on the entire series, it’s not quite as good of a fit. </p></div><div><p>The <em>Zelda </em>series has inspired many imitators of varying quality. While some of these games miss what people love about the iconic franchise, <em>Death’s Door </em>is not one of them. The indie title has you step into the talons of a crow who works as a grim reaper, gathering the souls of those whose time has come. On paper, it seems very different from Nintendo’s series which usually stars an elf-boy, but the gameplay loop is incredibly similar, making it a perfect fit for those who just wrapped up <em>Echoes of Wisdom.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Death’s Door</em> will have you explore dungeons, solve puzzles, and take on all manner of tough creatures, much like <em>Echoes of Wisdom. </em>However, <em>Death’s Door</em> doesn’t pull all its inspiration from one famous title, as it also incorporates elements from the wildly successful <em>Souls </em>games. While it is not as frustratingly difficult as FromSoft’s library, it does place a higher emphasis on combat than <em>Zelda</em> titles, allowing you to feel the rush of victory when you finally defeat a tough boss.<br></p><p>If <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>left you wanting a bit more of a challenge, <em>Death’s Door </em>might have what you’re looking for.</p></div><div><p>One of the first things you might notice about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is its creative art style. The clay-like animation is a feast for the eyes that has really only been seen in film and television. While few (if any games) provide an identical experience, <em>The Plucky Squire’s </em>is about as close as you can get. </p><p>The Devolver Digital-published title lets you play as characters from a storybook, and the 2D portions convey this fantasy world. As they transition into the real world, the graphics change from a cartoon design to a toy-like one, reminiscent of Zelda’s adventure. Outside of the visuals, the game doesn’t offer too much that hasn’t been seen before, but if your eyes are craving creativity, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> will make sure they get their fill.</p></div><div><p>One of the more interesting facets of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is how it’s basically a creature collector in disguise. Every time you defeat an enemy for the first time, you gain access to its Echo, opening up new strategies to tackle the game’s many obstacles. While <em>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</em> is not focused on gathering monsters to summon during combat, it does have a fairly similar take on collecting and using enemy abilities.</p><p>Most enemies in <em>Aria of Sorrow</em> have a special move that the protagonist Soma can gather and equip by defeating them. Unlike <em>Echoes, </em>it’s slightly more difficult to obtain these moves, since Konami’s title randomizes whether the slain monster will drop its ability, but the feeling it evokes is incredibly similar. You can spend hours combing Dracula’s Castle just to encounter every foe and add its powers to your toolbox.<br></p><p>As a Metroidvania, it’d also give you a bit of a break if you’re tired of the standard adventure fare after wrapping up <em>Echoes</em>. Best of all, the game is part of the <em>Castlevania: Advance Collection,</em> giving you two other fantastic titles for one reasonable price.</p></div><div><p>Okay, hear me out on this one. Yes, on the surface FromSoft’s highly acclaimed title has little to nothing in common with Nintendo’s latest outing in Hyrule. Everything from the tone to the gameplay to the difficulty is the complete opposite of the blissful experience <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides, which is what makes it the perfect palette cleanser.</p><p>There are also just enough minor similarities to help get you through the brutal gauntlet <em>Elden Ring</em> throws at you. You will have “Spirit Ashes” that you can obtain as you journey through the dreary, devastated Land Between to help you survive and defeat horrifying bosses. There’s also a familiar sense of exploration that includes finding secret dungeons scattered throughout the world, though <em>Elden Ring’s</em> is obviously much grander (and more dangerous).<br></p><p>Of course, this pick isn’t for everyone. But if you found the new <em>Zelda </em>a little too breezy and are looking for a completely different type of experience, <em>Elden Ring </em>will offer an experience unlike anything else. Also don’t be afraid to call on other players. It’s a feature of the game. It’s not cheating!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The time has come and 210 days after the initial service was supposed to shutter, Nintendo's 3DS and Wii U online servers are officially gone. The service lasted as long as it did due to the efforts of dedicated fans around the world. One final player was left by the end, with a system crash finally bringing the end of 3DS online play.</p><p>Player Fishguy6564 wasn't the only player to keep going until the curtain call, but he was certainly the most successful in terms of how long he managed to keep things going. "It's over. Rest in peace, Nintendo Network," Fishguy6564 tweeted Sunday morning along with showing his 3DS displaying an error message.</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/after-127-days-in-nintendo-server-purgatory-the-last-known-mario-kart-3ds-survivor-thinks-he-cant-be-stopped-this-could-go-on-forever/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar back in August</a>, Fishguy6564 said that he could potentially keep playing forever with the only caveat being "if the 3DS somehow gave in." Sadly, that was the foretold ending.</p><p>Fishguy wasn't the only player keeping the tracks alive. He and another fellow player, Marioiscool246, set off with a clear goal: Keep a lobby alive for as long as possible. They did this by installing a patch that "supposedly prevented the death of a lobby" by deploying two bots to race each other endlessly.</p><p>After Marioiscool246's 3DS crashed in May, Fishguy6564 kept going for almost seven months. Even back in August, he couldn't believe it lasted that long. "It sure has been a wild ride," he added.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/?dm_i=2AEH,217EC,AMZC5B,7CM2V,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting is now open</a> for Ultimate Game of the Year and Best Game Adaptation in the Golden Joystick Awards. If you've been wanting an opportunity to vote for your favorite game this year, the Golden Joystick Awards is the perfect opportunity. There are plenty of categories to vote in this year, and you can choose from categories such as Best Indie Game, Studio of the Year, and New Best Audio Design. In total, there are<a href="https://wccftech.com/voting-is-now-open-in-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards/"> 21 categories</a> to vote in this year, and as mentioned by Daniel Dawkins, this year has seen the most votes ever in their initial round of categories.</p>
<p>In a statement made by Daniel Dawkins, the Content Director of Games, Video, and Digital Events, he said that there has been "a record ten million+ votes in our initial round of categories... Ultimate Game of the Year is our most prestigious award which sits in its own voting window from November 4 to November 8, allowing the judging panel more time to assess the big winter releases."</p>
<p>Although this year has been somewhat quiet in terms of big releases, it has also seen the release of iconic games such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Tekken 8, and even games like Balatro and Satisfactory becoming big hits. In a world where people didn't have faith in the Silent Hill 2 remake, it was released and was done justice by Bloober Team and Konami, who knocked it out of the park. There are a lot of fantastic games to choose from on the nominations list for Ultimate Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, and here are all of the nominees for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Well</li>
<li>Astro Bot</li>
<li>Balatro</li>
<li>Black Myth: Wukong</li>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li>
<li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
<li>Helldivers 2</li>
<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
<li>Satisfactory</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2</li>
<li>Tekken 8</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Ultimate Game of the Year award, you can now vote for the Best Game Adaptation, where you've seen your favorite characters and franchises come to life on the big screen. Here are the nominations for that category in the Golden Joystick Awards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands</li>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Halo Season 2</li>
<li>Knuckles</li>
<li>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</li>
<li>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</li>
</ul>
<p>The Golden Joy Stick Awards will be taking place on November 21, where it will be live via YouTube, Twitch, Steam, Facebook, X, the Future Games Show, GamesRadar, PC Gamer, and TechRadar Gaming, offering you a multitude of places to watch it. If you don't want to sit through the awards, the winners will be announced on social media as the ceremony progresses, so you don't have to miss a beat.</p>
