			<p><strong>Square Enix's Naoki Yoshida</strong>, known as the producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XVI</strong> and the director and producer of <strong>Final Fantasy XIV</strong>, has teased a port of the popular <strong>MMORPG</strong> to <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> platforms during an in-game New Year celebration on Japanese servers. As <a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by the blog Livedoor, when asked about it, he replied 'Please look forward to it.' It's not quite a confirmation, but fans are taking it as a definite sign that progress is being made on that front. </p>



<p>Yoshida previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-xiv/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed the possibility</a> back in June 2024, when he opened the door to the port, but also suggested that it might not happen for quite some time. Now we're into 2026, though, so we might be closer to an announcement.</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy XIV director then returned to the topic in a Gamescom 2025 interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, when he mused on the benefits of such a port for existing players and newcomers.</p>



<p><em>For existing Final Fantasy XIV players, if hypothetically a Nintendo Switch 2 version was released, they would have the chance, for example, going through the main story—they could play that on the PC and do raiding on the PC. But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content, and I'm super excited about that sort of possibility for our players.</em></p>



<p><em>For those who have never played Final Fantasy XIV, the younger generation, if they started playing on Switch 2, being an MMO, it could be a genre new to them, and I would be really happy to introduce these new players to the genre and let them have fun with the game. It's precisely because of this that we have started discussions with Nintendo, and so far they have been positive, so I really hope that players can expect good news in the future.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, though, in the New Year message, Yoshida appears to have referenced Switch in general, rather than specifically the Switch 2. Final Fantasy XIV was originally released on the PlayStation 3, so it could certainly run on the Switch, although that platform has long since been abandoned and the latest expansions are a bit more taxing than the base game. The safest bet is to assume that the game will only launch on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, the game recently received patch 7.4, which introduced new Main Scenario Quests,​ a new dungeon, a new Trial,​ the Heavyweight Raid Tier for the Arcadion series,​ an overhaul of the Glamour System Overhaul, and a new​ Frontline map.</p>



<p>Chinese players already have a taste of playing the MMORPG on the go <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-gets-official-announcement-playtesting-begins-soon-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">through the mobile version</a>, <strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Crystal World</strong>, which was developed by Tencent's LightSpeed Studios and released in China on June 19, 2025. A global launch date has not been confirmed yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-kicks-off-2026-14-new-games-added-throughout-january/</link>
            <guid>1395439</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, <strong>NVIDIA</strong> sent the first <strong>GeForce NOW Thursday</strong> blast of the year, revealing the PC games that have entered the library this week and also those scheduled to be added throughout the whole month.</p>



<p>Let's begin with the former list. There's a new indie game that just launched, <strong>My Winter Car</strong>, and four games that have been out for some time but are now being supported by GeForce NOW. Eternights was not at all available on NVIDIA's cloud gaming platform, while the others could be streamed but only if you owned them via Steam; now, they can also be streamed if you own them via the Xbox or Epic Games stores.</p>



<ul>
<li>My Winter Car (New release on Steam, Dec. 29)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-casting-of-frank-stone-death-is-not-the-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/eternights-is-an-action-game-with-dating-sim-elements-set-during-the-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eternights</a> (Epic Games Store)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> (Epic Games Store, GeForce RTX 5080-ready)</li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I continue to be a strong advocate for Don't Nod's <strong>Banishers: Ghost of New Eden</strong>. If you enjoy the latest God of War games, this is one you don't want to miss. It's a little less polished, sure, but its overall quality is not that far removed from Santa Monica's acclaimed masterpieces, and it also offers a much greater degree of player agency. <strong>The Casting of Frank Stone</strong> and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</strong> are also two great titles in their respective genres.</p>



<p>As for the rest of January 2026, GeForce NOW users can expect the following titles to populate their library in the coming weeks:</p>



<ul>
<li>StarRupture (New release on Steam, Jan. 6)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pathologic 3</a> (New release on Steam, Jan. 9)</li>



<li>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check (New release on Steam, Jan. 12)</li>



<li>MIO: Memories in Orbit (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on Game Pass, Jan. 20)</li>



<li>Nova Roma (New release Steam, Jan. 22)</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-reforged-out-december-3-controller-steam-deck-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars: Reforged</a> (Steam)</li>



<li>Mon Bazou (Steam)</li>



<li>Supermarket Simulator (Xbox, available on Game Pass)</li>



<li>Tavern Keeper (Steam)</li>
</ul>



<p>Admittedly, when comparing this list with the official game release schedule, several notable titles are missing, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-fighting-game-2xko-full-launch-pc-consoles-january-20-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2XKO</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arknights-endfield-beta-test-ii-pc-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a></strong>, <strong>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Vein II</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/front-mission-1st-remake-to-release-this-november-front-mission-3-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Front Mission 3 Remake</a></strong>. That said, it is still possible NVIDIA will add them to GeForce NOW at a later time; the initial list announced at the beginning of each month is usually bolstered by several late additions.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-series-11-crashes-to-record-low-to-wind-down-its-2025-smartwatch-lineup-2000656173</link>
            <guid>1395436</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="620">As the new year begins, it’s a natural time to think about fresh starts, new routines, and treating yourself to something that actually adds value to your daily life. This is the perfect moment to invest in a piece of tech that supports your health, productivity, and lifestyle moving forward. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">Apple’s latest release, the Apple Watch Series 11, launched earlier this year and is already seeing impressive discounts of up to 25%, making it a smart and timely upgrade to kick off the year.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1323" data-end="1927">What’s New in the Series 11</h2>
<p data-start="1323" data-end="1927">The Apple Watch Series 11 represents Apple’s most advanced mainstream smartwatch to date. Compared to earlier generations, it brings noticeable improvements in health tracking, durability, connectivity, and overall software experience. The redesigned Liquid Glass interface gives the display a cleaner, more modern look. Enhanced Smart Stack widgets make it easier to access relevant information throughout the day, while new gesture-based controls—like a one-handed wrist flick to dismiss notifications—add convenience to everyday use.</p>
<p data-start="1929" data-end="2460">Health and fitness remain at the core of the Apple Watch experience. The Series 11 supports a wide range of biometric tracking features, including heart rate monitoring, ECG readings, blood oxygen levels, cycle tracking, and sleep analysis. A new hypertension notification feature can alert users to trends that may suggest elevated blood pressure, helping them stay informed about potential health concerns. The watch has a sleep score system, making it easy to understand sleep patterns and work toward better rest.</p>
<p data-start="2462" data-end="2810">On the software side, features like Workout Buddy provide personalized fitness insights and encouragement, helping you stay motivated and consistent with your goals. And of course, the Series 11 still includes all the familiar Apple Watch integrations, such as seamless syncing with an iPhone for calls, messages, notifications, Apple Pay, and more.</p>


<p data-start="2812" data-end="3404">From a design perspective, the Series 11 stays true to Apple’s signature sleek look. It’s available in 42mm and 46mm sizes, with a choice between aluminum or premium titanium cases. The aluminum models feature upgraded Ion-X glass, which Apple claims is roughly twice as scratch-resistant as before. With water resistance up to 50 meters and added dust protection, the watch is well suited for workouts, outdoor activities, and everyday wear. Cellular models also support 5G connectivity, allowing for faster data speeds and improved performance when your iPhone isn’t nearby.</p>
<p data-start="3740" data-end="3990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6636/">If you’re looking for a meaningful way to start the new year with something that supports healthier habits, the Apple Watch Series 11 is a compelling choice.</a> The smaller 42mm model originally debuted at $399, but it’s currently available for just $299 thanks to a 25% discount. That’s a $100 savings. If you prefer a larger display, the 46mm version is also discounted. It launched at $429 and is now priced at $329, reflecting a 23% price drop. No matter which size you choose, you’re saving the same $100 for a limited time. Apple also offers a wide range of customization options, including case finishes like jet black, rose gold, and silver, along with bands in colors such as black, light blush, and purple fog, allowing you to tailor the watch to your personal style.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Obsidian's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain "builds" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this aspect of Avowed's gameplay didn't sit well with everyone. Some didn't like how empty areas felt after a while. Others hated that they couldn't farm enemies for experience points or random loot--a shortcoming that exacerbated the irritating grind of upgrading gear before Avowed's day-one patch. In most cases, the complaints about this feature are reasonable. That said, I liked the idea of never having to face the same enemy twice. Not having to worry about battling the same group of skeletons on return trips to their camp was great, especially during those times when I needed to collect something I missed; returning for a chest that could only be opened with a specific key (or several lock picks) was a breeze.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294"></a><figcaption>Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>I also liked how my actions had consequences. If I made a place relatively safe for travelers to explore, it stayed that way. And conversations with NPCs would reflect how I was able to put down a group of bandits that threatened their town. Again, this sort of thing is common when dealing with story-based missions or important side quests. It's easier to role-play when everything you do matters, though. Even on a small scale, it's nice to feel like you're a meaningful part of Avowed's world.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The most notable reason this novel feature is a good thing has to do with farmable enemies. There aren't any, which in turn means that grinding for XP isn't a thing. Obsidian has created multiple combat systems that, when combined, offset the need to constantly hit certain levels. Yeah, there are places that are initially off-limits to new players. And seeing multiple enemies with skulls over their heads (indicating their threat level) could mean trouble. But thanks to the ability to upgrade weapons/gear, flexible build-crafting, competent AI companions, and a generous helping of XP whenever a quest is completed, I never felt under-leveled when trying to complete a story-based mission.</p><p dir="ltr">I've played enough video games over the years to know that grinding, while being a respected method of controlling the pace of certain activities, isn't always needed. I've also gotten to a point where I can better appreciate a developer's efforts to respect my time as a player; this is less "old person yelling at the clouds" and more "I no longer have all of the time in the world to play games." That's not to say that I didn't partake in side quests, bounties, and more--just that I was never made to feel like I had to do those things to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed offered me a balanced experience throughout my entire playthrough. And part of that appeal came from Obsidian's deliberate efforts to allow players to play at their own pace. You could go through the game clearing all the camps, caves, and abandoned mines in hopes of min/maxing your character. You can also, for the most part, just stick to the main questline and still have a good time. Creating a game that doesn't allow for enemy respawns--which requires changes to the normal RPG grind-fest formula--works in Avowed's favor.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Biggest Xbox Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be a huge year for gaming, and Xbox players have plenty to be excited for with a host of first-party titles landing on the platform as part of a Game Pass subscription, alongside major multi-platform releases.</p>



<p>The past year was a bit of a mixed bag for Xbox, with several major delays hitting the platform hard, and, overall, 2025 felt a lot like a transitional year for gaming as a whole. Still, it’s certainly laid down the groundwork for 2026 to be huge, with more releases to enjoy than you can count.</p>



<p>With so many big releases coming in 2026, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in the next 12 months that Xbox players can’t miss.</p>



<h2 id="h-8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026">8 Biggest Xbox Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Japan awaits. Credit to Playground Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though Forza Horizon 5 still stands as the best racing game available on the platform, the open-world adventure turns five in 2026, and a successor is overdue. Step forward Forza Horizon 6, with the setting of the game already announced to be in Japan, something that players have wanted for a long time.</p>



<p>Although the Horizon franchise is no longer Xbox exclusive, with the fifth game released on PlayStation 5 in 2025, Xbox remains the best place to play the title due to the Game Pass release. Additionally, a release on other platforms, including PlayStation, could come after an initial Xbox release.</p>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Delayed. Image via Rockstar</figcaption></figure>



<p>The long, long wait for the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally coming next year, assuming there are no further delays from Rockstar, and, with anticipation for GTA 6 being so high and the wait being so long, the eventual release will spread further than the usual sphere of gaming and will make a significant impact in media as a whole.</p>



<p>There are still many unanswered questions surrounding GTA 6, and we should start to see more about the game revealed, edging closer to a release, but expect Fall 2026 to be dominated by GTA 6 entirely, with other developers frantically moving things about so their release doesn’t clash with the titan.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Long wait. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initially slated for a release in 2025, Playground Games’ Fable relaunch was delayed until 2026 back in February 2025, and there are still some questions on whether that release window will be met. Regardless, the relaunch of the franchise is a big deal for Xbox in a period where its big in-house projects have fallen short of expectations on many cases.</p>



<p>It’s been an extremely long wait for Fable to emerge, and the stakes are high as the initial games have such a high amount of popularity, so reaching the high bars that have been set may be tricky. Either way, Fable will go down as one of the must-play games on Xbox in 2026, assuming it isn’t delayed again.</p>



<h3 id="h-subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Splashdown. Image via Unknown Worlds Entertainment </figcaption></figure>



<p>Another title that was initially due to release into early access in 2025, a delay pushed that period for Subnautica 2 back into 2026, and eyes are cast towards Krafton following a messy situation that has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unknown Worlds suing its former leadership</a> and co-founders with claims of sabotage and abandonment.</p>



<p>While all that rumbles on in the background, excitement for the next entry in the Subnautica franchise continues to rise. Both the initial game and Below Zero made a big impression in the open-world survival action-adventure genre, setting high expectations for the third game in the franchise.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Set 14 years before the events of the original Gears of War, which was re-released as Gears of War: Reloaded in August 2025, a move that brought the franchise onto PlayStation for the first time, E-Day is set on the events of Emergence Day when the Locust first reared their ugly heads.</p>



<p>It’s fair to say the more recent entries in the Gears of War franchise were not quick as impactful as the first three, but the prequel provides the opportunity to detail more background into the original trilogy, as well as bringing characters that were killed off in later games back into the fray.</p>

<p>Similar to the Gears of War franchise, the last few Halo games released were not quite as big as hits as the initial games in the franchise, which is now going back to the beginning with Halo: Campaign Evolved. While another remake has attracted criticism in some corners, it does provide the platform to build the next generation of the franchise.</p>



<p>Focusing on the campaign only has been controversial, but the up-to-date tools used will bring the original Halo game to life once again in different ways from before, and will surely help development of future games. Even if you still play the Masterchief Collection regularly, Campaign Evolved is worth some effort.</p>



<h3 id="h-high-on-life-2">High on Life 2</h3>

<p>Squanch Games’ sequel to the original game of the same name, High on Life 2 is set for release on February 13, and will be available day one for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. With the early months of next year looking slightly barren in places, it’s a great opportunity for High on Life 2 to shine.</p>



<p>The comedic shooter is definitely a can’t-miss game of 2026 for Xbox players and, if you never played the first game, there’s still time to rectify that before the release date.</p>



<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-2026">Call of Duty 2026</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New start? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another year, another Call of Duty title, surely it’s the same old thing? Perhaps not, as a big update was provided in December that confirmed back-to-back releases of titles in the franchise will be scrapped, after two years of Black Ops titles drew criticism and fatigue.</p>



<p>Not much is known about 2026 yet, and it remains to be seen whether it will bring a new Modern Warfare title or a new direction entirely, but the confirmation of a change in direction shows Activision is listening to the community, which should raise hopes for the 2026 Call of Duty title.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sometimes you need some extra power to get you through emergency situations. Or maybe you want to spend some time off the grid and need power to facilitate that. The Anker SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is a heavy-duty, portable power solution to provide you with the energy needed to power your devices, appliances, and equipment anywhere you need them. And best of all, it can last and last as long as you need it.</p>
<p>It’s not budget-priced normally by any means, but it’s on sale right now, so buying it might be a little less painful. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6634/">Anker SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is available on Amazon for just $2,199; this is significantly lower than its original price of $5,397 (a reduction of $3,198) and represents a savings of approximately 59% of the retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6634/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power to fuel you through emergencies, off-grid excursions, and more</h2>
<p>The SOLIX F3000 was created for serious users and is capable of supplying the power to support the needs of larger electronics, tools and appliances for hours on end. This lets you use your power station for camping/RV trips as well as an emergency backup during a power outage. It can power appliances such as refrigerators, power tools, lights, communication equipment and many other items, without the need to continually switch between batteries or search for outlets.</p>
<p>The SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station features multiple output types including AC outlets, USB-C, and USB-A to provide you with the flexibility to be able to charge and power a wide array of items simultaneously. The inclusion of USB-C PD (Power Delivery) helps you charge things fast. All the various charging options in one single unit makes things a lot easier, too. No more having to fumble with all the cords you might usually be stuck with.</p>



<p>Recharging the SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is also flexible and convenient. Char standard wall outlet, a vehicle charger while traveling, or solar panels that are compatible with the unit. The availability of solar charging means you can use the power station for longer periods of time while away from a typical electrical power source. Additionally, the fact that you can recharge the SOLIX F3000 using multiple methods decreases the likelihood of you running low on power when you need it the most.</p>
<p>With its massive capacity, a multitude of output options, and a number of options to recharge the unit, the Anker SOLIX F3000 Portable Power Station is a great pick to make sure you’re powered up any time you need it. And if you want to invest in something that will last, this is your best bet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the past few days, dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> fans started taking an in-depth look at the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Title Update 4</strong> files,<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> discovering mention of a Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong></a> and some of its potential features, including a dedicated <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">NVIDIA DLSS profile</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">local multiplayer support</strong> with multiple consoles.</p>



<p>The idea of seeing a game that still runs poorly on many PC configuartions and other consoles was obvioulsy met with skepticism, but if you shared the community sentiment of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> being an <strong>impossible Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, you'd better think again, as newly discovered information and a screenshot simulating the graphics settings of the Switch 2 version suggest that a lot of thought is going into this new release.</p>



<p>As reported on the <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q0zjcp/more_datamined_info_regarding_the_switch_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>, a Chinese group specializing in datamining the latest entry in the <strong>CAPCOM</strong> series discovered a lot more information on the game's <strong>Nintendo Switch 2 port</strong>, starting with the graphics presets, which target <strong>30 FPS gameplay using NVIDIA DLSS</strong>, outputting at <strong>1080p resolution in docked mode</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is hardly surprising, considering the system's specifications, these settings won't turn the Nintendo Switch 2 version into a <strong>"Potato Mode"</strong> game. The datamining group applied these graphics settings and shared a screenshot captured from the PC version of the game, simulating how the Switch 2 version will look.</p>



<p>And the results are <strong>definitely promising</strong>, especially if similar care is given to the handheld mode profile. This version of the game would also finally provide a <strong>proper on-the-go option</strong> for many, as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> doesn't run well on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>, which can't leverage <strong>NVIDIA DLSS</strong> as the Nintendo system can.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-first-screenshot.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>A PC-simulated look at Monster Hunter Wilds on Nintendo Switch 2, utilizing the leaked 'NSW2' graphics presets found in the Title Update 4 files</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In addition to the information above, the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Monster Hunter Wilds </em>datamining group also discovered strings detailing the Switch 2 version's local multiplayer feature - <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to create or join a lobby using local wireless communication,"</strong></em> and "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Search for lobbies using local wireless communication. </strong></em><span><em><strong>Bring Nintendo Switch 2 consoles together to allow up to four players to participate,"</strong></em>&nbsp;- and mention of&nbsp;<strong>Tempered Gogmazios</strong>, whose </span><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/over-100-performance-improvements-are-coming-to-monster-hunter-wilds-next-week/"><span>base variant </span>was added to the game with Title Update 4.</a></strong></p>



<p>This <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Switch 2 port of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong>, which now essentially only requires an official confirmation with all this information discovered inside the game's files, is likely part of an effort to bring more players to the latest entry in the series, as CAPCOM thinks that <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-high-price-playstation-5/"><strong>the high price of the PlayStation 5 system impacted the game's sales in Japan.</strong></a></p>



<p>Hopefully, this effort will bear fruit and indeed bring both newcomers and <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>lapsed players back to the game</strong></a> as director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yuya Tokuda</strong> wished. Even with its issues, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is a game that deserves to be experienced, as I wrote in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">review last year</strong>.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-restocks-the-soundlink-revolve-series-ii-speaker-at-all-time-low-to-start-2026-after-year-end-clearance-2000654996</link>
            <guid>1395388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose makes some of our favorite audio solutions around, from soundbars to headphones, speakers, and more. Those on the hunt for a portable Bluetooth speaker that keeps you entertained with your favorite songs for hours on the go should consider <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series 2 speaker, which is currently going for a 33% discount at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>This brings the total down to just $199 from $299, saving you a total of $100. The deal applies to the black color option. The stunning silver is discounted, too, sitting at $179 right now. Note that the retailer has marked both the discounts as limited-time offers, so we’re not expecting them to last long. Grab them before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Party Going</h2>
<p>The 10W speaker looks like an adorable mini lantern. It comes with a built-in handle for portability, plus features all the essential controls right at the top for easier management. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though. You’ll enjoy stable, rich sound for all your favorite tracks, whether you’re jamming to the latest Post Malone song or just want to have some calm music playing in the background as you wrap up those last-minute Christmas gifts.</p>
<p>Audio connection options include Bluetooth and a 3.5 mm stereo audio cable, whichever you prefer. A wireless range of up to 9 m (30 ft.) lets you move around with ease when you have your device connected to the speaker wirelessly. Pairing couldn’t be simpler. The dedicated app offers a drag-and-drop interface where you can switch between Bluetooth devices within seconds. For reference, Revolve 2 Plus can keep track of the last eight connected devices at the same time. There’s a built-in microphone, too, which lets you take calls directly from the speaker without going through the hassle of disconnecting your phone first. This also makes it easy to communicate with your voice assistant to get other things done, such as checking the schedule, creating a playlist, adjusting volume, etc.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from the speaker’s IP55 water-resistant rating. This protects it from everyday water splashes (by the pool, in the shower), plus light drizzle, ensuring the party goes on in all weather conditions. As for the battery life, a single charge gets you up to 17 hours of playtime, meaning you can go at least a couple of days without plugging it in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5646/">It usually goes for around $300, but the current 33% discount lets you pick it up for less than $200 today.</a> Both the silver and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. But again, the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab the speaker quickly. We also suggest taking a look at the delivery timeline during checkout to know if you’ll receive it before Christmas or after New Year’s. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other audio solutions going for less at Amazon, too. The retailer’s own devices are currently available at up to 60% off, which makes now a great time to stock up on some essentials, plus high-ticket items, without blowing your budget.</p>

<p>PlayStation surely wants a massive 2026 as the PS5 generation starts to wind down, and the key to the PS5 being a success is having another long list of incredible PlayStation games launching in 2025. Insider Gaming has picked out the biggest and best PlayStation games.</p>



<p>PS5’s exclusive games are becoming even fewer and farther between as we get scarily close to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS6</a> era. It’s not helped by the fact that the age-old ‘exclusive’ is dying as the world’s biggest gaming brands are intent on making the most money possible, and this requires a game to launch on all major platforms. Still, Sony has some bona fide PlayStation weapons up its luxurious 2026-tailored sleeves.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to fill your gaming calendar with the hottest exclusives and releases, this article has everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-ps5-exclusives-coming-in-2026">Biggest PS5 Exclusives Coming In 2026</h2>



<p>One entry on this list stands out as being a bit ‘sus,’ but for the most part, these are the biggest PS5 games coming out for PlayStation in 2026. Obviously, between Summer Game Fest, Sony State of Play showcases, and special announcements, we could always see more PS5 exclusives revealed throughout the year. Stay tuned for more.</p>



<h3 id="h-saros">Saros</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Housemarque</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s always a good day when Hosuemarque is working on a new game. It’s the company that literally never misses, and is responsible for legendary PlayStation games such as Super Stardust, Resogun, and 2021’s incredible Returnal. From Dead Nation to Alienation and Nex Machina, the developer only deals in premium, polished packages.</p>







<p>Saros is a spiritual successor to Returnal and looks like an evolution in every aspect. From the bright and beaming balls and bullets boomed at you by elusive foes in true bullet-hell fashion, to the incredible attention to detail in the visuals and sound design. It’s hard to see Saros being anything but a system-selling, Game of the Year contender come the end of 2026.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you thought Insomniac was going to hold back on Wolverine’s violence, then you can tuck your adamantium tail between your legs and go and find something a bit more casual. Wolverine is Logan in his most primal and animalistic form. Insomniac kept a cloak over him for quite a while after the initial reveal, but now we’ve seen that this beast has claws.</p>



<p>The combat-centric action that the studio has mastered with the Marvel’s Spider-Man series plays a part here. But expect a deeper, darker, and more disturbing array of moves for the massacre-making mutant. It’s destined for 2026 and will likely be Sony’s <em>big </em>exclusive of the year.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>Team Ninja took a brief hiatus from Nioh to work on new IPs: Wo Long Fallen Dynasty and Rise of the Ronin. It also resurrected long-time fan favorite Ninja Gaiden, with the fourth mainline release in 2025. Now, it’s time for another dose of Soulslike samurai action with Nioh 3. </p>



<p>While FromSoftware rightfully gets the credit and acclaim for its Souls games, the Nioh games are incredibly deep, which is to be expected from the sick geniuses at Team Ninja. Nioh 3 is a slight outlier here as it’s technically releasing on PC as well as PS5, but not Xbox or Nintendo, so it can be given a pass.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 | Reveal Trailer | State of Play 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CayQOZV602M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-biggest-2025-ps5-games">Biggest 2025 PS5 Games</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>This could easily be the shortest entry of any on this list. What else needs to be said about Grand Theft Auto 6? Depending on how you count Tetris, GTA 5 is the second or third best-selling game in history. GTA 6 is expected to go one better, and it’s probably the biggest and most important video game that will ever be made.</p>



<p>Who knows, it could be the final GTA game. Considering how long it takes Rockstar to make new games now, and with a Red Dead Redemption 3, or another new or revived IP hovering around, who knows how long it’ll be until a potential GTA 7—if ever.</p>



<p>This is <em>the </em>game of 2026…unless it’s delayed AGAIN.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom’s Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline game in the franchise. You return to a bombed-out Raccoon City, following its devastation at the hands of a planned missile strike at the end of Resident Evil 3. Grace Ashcroft (daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft) is the unfortunate character in the hot seat this time around—although the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon Keneddy rumors</a> are growing.</p>



<p>You’ll be chased by another Tyrant-like monster, and there will be a big emphasis on running and survival. This should be music to the ears of you old-school Resident Evil fans. You can’t go wrong with a new Resi game, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-shown-exclusively-in-japan-reveals-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Requiem gameplay</a> shows that a real biohazard awaits you.</p>

</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It feels weird to see IO Interactive’s name attached to something not Hitman-related. The Danish studio has been given the unenviable task of offering the world a new portrayal of James Bond and has a fully fledged license to thrill. The story focuses on Bond’s formative years as an agent, meaning we’re getting to see the youngest, most unpolished, and easily inexperienced version of the world’s most coveted and acclaimed secret agent.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage suggests that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-lights-combat-and-physicality-is-inspired-by-the-daniel-craig-era-of-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a> won’t be a complete departure from Hitman, and there are clearly some nuances and stylish licks politely borrowed for good measure.</p>

<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to 343 Industries</figcaption></figure>



<p>The day Forza Horizon 5 became available on PlayStation 5 was a very strange one; it felt like a noticeable shift in the industry. Gears of War: Reloaded plunged us further into the rabbit hole of incredulity, and now Halo is coming to PlayStation 5—the console wars are <em>officially </em>over.</p>



<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved marks the near-25-year franchise’s first appearance on a PlayStation console. It’s only the campaign, but for lifelong Sony fans (such as myself), this is a chance to start from the ground up. PS5 owners can see what the fuss is all about and see why Xbox dominated the shooter scene for years.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has been reporting on the long-rumored Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for years. While early AC games—such as Assassin’s Creed 2—get a lot of love, there’s something undeniably special (daresay perfect) about Black Flag. Ubisoft has done its best to conceal details and go as far as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening to sue an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag actor over a Remake slip-up</a>.</p>



<p>As per our exclusive story, we believe the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>. Once it happens (not if), then it will be one of the biggest games of 2025, and one you need to own on PS5.</p>

<p>Okay, okay.

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Player Count Doubts Debated as ARC Raiders Hits Huge Numbers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-arc-raiders-player-count-debate/</link>
            <guid>1395364</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s a new player-count-related debate spreading like wildfire throughout the gaming space, and it concerns the success of ARC Raiders compared to the relative failure of Battlefield 6. In recent days, fans of both titles have been actively engaging in a debate to determine why one is soaring while the other can’t seem to do anything right.</p>



<p>This stems from Steam player counts (where else?), which paint a telling tale. Two months after release, ARC Raiders has managed to retain 91% of its peak player count on Steam, while Battlefield 6 has witnessed an 85% <strong>plummeting drop</strong> in the numbers.</p>



<p>Where do you stand on the debate?</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-isn-t-the-ultimate-litmus-test-for-gaming-numbers">Steam Isn’t the Ultimate Litmus Test for Gaming Numbers</h2>



<p>Too many people are still reliant on Steam’s figures for the picture of health for a game, but extrapolation is king. It could be considered woefully unfair to use <strong>a single platform </strong>to determine the overall health of a game like Battlefield 6, given that on PC, that’s arguably not even the most popular launcher for the game.</p>



<p>It doesn’t matter much, as the debate rages, and Steam data is all we have to go on when it comes to facts and figures.</p>



<p>In the most recent news, it was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/12/31/arc-raiders-has-kept-91-of-its-playerbase-battlefield-6-has-lost-85/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> that drew attention to the numbers, pointing out that ARC Raiders has retained 91% of its player base after two months. On the other hand, Battlefield 6, which was released in proximity to Embark Studios’ new extraction shooter, has plummeted by more than 85%.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a fractured debate for many reasons.</p>



<p>First, the live-service model for ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 is quite different. The former operates on delivering new missions, progression paths, unlocks, boss characters, maps, and events, which represent much more <strong>meat </strong>than what Battlefield offers. EA’s new first-person shooter is focused more on new maps, modes, and battle pass bundles than anything else.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, being an extraction shooter, has a ‘reset loop’ that ensures players can come back every few weeks and restart their playthrough, which isn’t a thing in Battlefield 6, a typical multiplayer shooter. There’s point two in the argument against this debate.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders also represents something new and exciting in the gaming space: a truly accessible extraction shooter. At the same time, Battlefield 6 is just a first-person shooter with a boots-on-the-ground military setting, and they’re a dime a dozen. Folks came, saw, enjoyed the game, and departed for greener pastures when things started going south.</p>



<p>That’s <strong>the third point</strong>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The <strong>fourth point </strong>against the argument is that ARC Raiders has simply been doing things better where Battlefield 6 is failing. In recent weeks, some of the new maps, modes, and bundles released in the Battlefield 6 space have left players disappointed, and controversies have surfaced regarding gen-AI art that have gone unexplained by Electronic Arts.</p>



<p>It’s simple, really. While Battlefield has a peak of 747,440 on Steam, it’s mostly comprised of players edging with curiosity into a game that marked a potential resurgence for a failing franchise. They dipped their toes in the water, and many of them decided to ultimately move on.</p>



<p>Conversely, ARC Raiders operates on a concept that many hadn’t ever experienced before it dropped. They’ve tried it, liked what’s on offer, and more have decided to hang around. It also helps that you can invest in ARC Raiders for as little as $30, and everything after that point, bar cosmetics, is free.</p>



<p>So, it’s safe to say we can cap this debate and move on. It’s a non-starter, apples and oranges, chalk and cheese, and something barely worth addressing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Shroud Predicts ARC Raiders Will Be ‘Bigger Than Fortnite’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-arc-raiders-fortnite-hot-take/</link>
            <guid>1395358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a statement that some have dubbed a hot take, popular streamer and former esports pro, Shroud, has suggested that ARC Raiders is <strong>bigger </strong>than Fortnite. He suggested that, going forward, Embark Studios’ extraction shooter will be <strong>bigger than </strong>the likes of Fortnite, VALORANT, and Apex Legends, prompting many to doubt his knowledge of ball.</p>



<p>Shroud has found plenty of success streaming ARC Raiders since the game dropped on October 30, but this latest comment is a tricky one, and it has fans debating how serious the content creator was.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-arc-raiders-be-bigger-than-fortnite">Will ARC Raiders Be Bigger Than Fortnite?</h2>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/2006425120722792795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent stream</a>, Shroud plainly stated:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game is definitely the biggest game since Fortnite for sure. The only other game I can think of along the way is maybe like VALORANT and Apex. But I think this game is bigger than both those games and will be bigger as time goes on.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was a hot take, and it has since been met with some ridicule, even from fans of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The extraction adventure title, which was released by Embark Studios on October 30, has proven to be one of the biggest hits of 2025. It’s one of the most popular extraction games ever made, and two months after release, it is effortlessly retaining enormous player counts across all platforms where other, similar games have faltered and fallen.</p>



<p>To say it’s bigger than Fortnite is a stretch, though. It’s no big secret that Fortnite is the most successful live-service shooter of all time, and the most popular battle royale title ever created. It has peaked at more than 40 million concurrent players, while ARC Raiders has managed a peak concurrent user count of 481,000 on Steam. </p>



<p>Embark Studios remains committed to expanding and evolving ARC Raiders and has already pushed out some engaging events and updates since the game dropped. Before ARC Raiders dropped, Embark Studios pledged <strong>years </strong>of support, and it’s easy to see that happening given what we already know about the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/harada-tekken-dead-veteran-dev-final-message/</link>
            <guid>1395349</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Katsuhiro Harada has bid farewell to more than thirty years of working under the Bandai Namco banner, moving on from Tekken after decades of developing the series. In a new social media post, Harada ushered in 2026 by stressing that he’s ‘no longer a developer/creator of the TEKKEN series’.</p>



<p>At the start of December 2025, Harada and the Bandai Namco team shared the news that the legendary developer would be parting ways with the firm after 31 years.</p>







<h2 id="h-katsuhiro-harada-has-moved-on">Katsuhiro Harada Has Moved On</h2>



<p>In a new post on social media, Katsuhiro Harada shared the following message:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I’m no longer a developer / creator of the TEKKEN series.</p><p>Harada_TEKKEN is completely dead.</p></div>— Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/2006390358859809229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>The iconic developer was quick to update his bio, writing, ‘Former Game Director and Chief Producer of action and fighting games.’</p>



<p>On December 8, Harada shared the revelation with fans worldwide that he would be stepping down from his tenured spot at Bandai Namco:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans shared their sentiments in the comments under Harada’s post. One drew comparisons to the series that Harada was pivotal in creating, saying, ‘Heihachi ‘died’ like 4 times. Kazuya came back from a volcano. We know how this works in the Tekken universe. See you in the next patch notes, boss.’</p>



<p>Others offered more simple, heartfelt messages: ‘We will always think of you, Harada-san, thank you for everything.’</p>



<p>Harada worked in production and direction roles on the Tekken series since Tekken 3 debuted in 1997, and was a driving force in the space ever since. He’s set to appear one last time in the Tekken space at some upcoming esports events, but then the world afterwards is his oyster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#935)—Clues and Answers for Thursday, January 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-1-935/</link>
            <guid>1395343</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I haven’t seen you since last year! It’s 2026, and it’s time to keep moving forward with stacks of NYT Connections hints, solutions, and tips. If you’ve burst into 2026 with a desire to keep your NYT Connections streak running, I’m here to help you achieve that resolution. Below, you’ll find the solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below what your resolutions are for 2026 and how you plan to hold yourself to them!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #935:</p>



<ul>
<li>SHUCK</li>



<li>SCOTCH</li>



<li>HEAD</li>



<li>RAT</li>



<li>CURSE</li>



<li>SKIN</li>



<li>NUT</li>



<li>FLY</li>



<li>HOUND</li>



<li>FINGERS</li>



<li>SPELL</li>



<li>SHELL</li>



<li>CHARM</li>



<li>BUFF</li>



<li>PEEL</li>



<li>HEX</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about the small, concentrated forms of supernatural influence — the kind of mystical actions that show up in fairy tales, fantasy novels, or folklore.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Imagine you’re prepping food in a kitchen — or working with anything that has a natural outer layer</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are the words you attach to someone who is REALLY into a topic — the kind of person who knows every detail, every fact, every obscure bit of trivia.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Picture the word “butter” followed by another word to form a familiar phrase or compound.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 1:</p>

		<p>It is the start of a new year which means one thing! That thing is the annual ceremony of an NBA 2K servers being switched off. From now on, January 1st 2026, all online functionality for NBA 2K24 has been switched off. That means no more multiplayer, MyCareer or MyTeam but modes that don’t require an internet connection like MyNBA and Play Now are still playable. NBA 2K24 was released on September 8th, 2023 and was removed from sale in October 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K24 | Official Gameplay Trailer | 2K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GITzbGIiNKg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>NBA 2K’s support page states, <em>“As of January 1, 2026, you’ll no longer be able to play multiplayer games or access any online game modes. MyCAREER and MyTEAM will no longer be available, and it will no longer be possible to earn Virtual Currency (VC). While you will still be able to enjoy Play Now, MyNBA, The W, and MyWNBA, any features that require a connection to 2K servers will be unavailable. This includes multiplayer, Online Leagues, and community sharing. We thank you for being a part of our community and hope you continue to enjoy&nbsp;NBA 2K!”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/17/nba-2k24-review/">NBA 2K24 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our NBA 2K24 review I wrote, <em>“Regardless of what this review says, NBA 2K24 will sell millions of copies, and generate millions of dollars through VC. That is because basketball fans who want to play a basketball game have nowhere else to go. The on court action is really good, but without competition to keep them honest, 2K’s monetisation has got out of hand and made modes like MyCareer near unplayable without extra investment from players.”</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/01/happy-new-year-2026/</link>
            <guid>1395253</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Once more around the Sun we go, starting a fresh circuit from this fairly arbitrary starting line. It’s a time that many of us pick to be a symbolic fresh start, to tackle the upcoming twelve months with a renewed vim, vigour and determination that it’s going to be “my year”. Will it be? I certainly hope so!</p>
<p>Looking back on the video games of 2025, and had a pretty great year of play, didn’t we? There were plenty of pleasant surprises in the first half of the year, from the brilliant and unique puzzling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/07/blue-prince-review/">Blue Prince</a> to the incredible&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which easily stood shoulder to shoulder with much bigger budget games and immediately became a Game of the Year contender.</p>



<p>But then there was all the build up to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Nintendo had remained rather tight-lipped over the successor to the sensationally popular Nintendo Switch, finally revealing the Switch 2 in January to be a….. well, another Switch-style console. By the time they revealed the launch line up and pricing, the general sentiment was muted at best. Could a new Mario Kart, some upgraded Zelda games and the Joy-Con now having a mouse mode <em>really</em> propel this to success? Turns out, yes, it really could! The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/the-switch-2-sold-over-10-million-consoles-in-just-4-months/">Switch 2 has become the fastest-selling console in history</a> through its opening months, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> has been hugely popular, and there’s been enough upgrades and fresh ports of games (once again getting a surprising amount of performance from modest specs) to keep us interested.</p>


<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">GTA 6 facing a delay to next year</a> (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">twice</a>!), the back half of 2025 opened up to the battle of the first person shooters. Within quick succession, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> arrived to grab the attention of long-suffering Battlefield fans and disaffected Call of Duty players alike – which was only strengthened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/25/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/">Black Ops 7</a> did arrive to prove everyone’s fears about the campaign true. Sandwiched in the middle was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a>, arriving with a wave of interest in the best-looking example of the extraction shooter yet.</p>
<p>But there was still plenty of space for&nbsp;quirky indie titles, like the thoroughly silly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/megabonk">Megabonk</a>, long-awaited indie sequels getting surprise releases in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>While these were all highlights, 2025 still felt like a real struggle for many. As featured in our yearly Biggest Disappointment award, the wash of redundancies, game cancellations and studio closures continued, and while thankfully not to quite the same extent as in 2024, it still saw <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/warner-bros-shuts-down-monolith-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Warner Bros. gutting a bunch of their studios</a> (it’s got to the point that Netflix considers them worthless in their company takeover bid), and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Microsoft closing down The Initiative and cancelling Perfect Dark, Everwild and ending support of Forza Motorsport</a>.</p>
<p>On to 2026 and… well, it could be a great year for games. Will we actually see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> released this year? Who knows, but I’d put money on Insomniac meeting their launch target for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/24/wolverine-ps5-trailer/">Wolverine</a>, there’s firmer release dates for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/new-resident-evil-requiem-trailer-leon/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>, and plenty more besides. We’ll be featuring all of these and more in our Most Wanted list.</p>

<p>You don’t have to dig too deeply to find spreading diseases lurking behind the surface. Generative AI has helped to feed the fire of some of the layoffs in the last couple of years, and there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/28/electronic-arts-saudi-investment-fund-trump/">the looming buyout of EA by the Saudi PIF</a> which is banking on this to enable a restructuring plan.&nbsp;The obsession with generative AI is also now sucking up all the world’s RAM supplies which is already hitting the wider tech industry, both for PCs and broader integrated electronics, and GPU makers are shifting focus to meet that currently oh-so-lucrative bubble.</p>
<p>Still, we can try to remain hopeful and optimistic, support the developers and ventures that we like as we go, and enjoy the gaming highlights as they come.</p>
<p>And with that, it’s just left to me to wish you once again a very Happy New Year from the entire TSA team, to thank you for visiting our humble gaming site through the year, and to say we hope you’ll continue to join us for all your gaming news and reviews in 2026!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/"><span>a June interview with </span><i><span>Rolling Stone</span></i></a><span>, the musician Woodkid spoke about working with Hideo Kojima to create the soundtrack for this year’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>. Asked what he’s learned from his time with the veteran game director, Woodkid shares an illuminating anecdote about a time when Kojima approached him with a concern. According to the singer-songwriter, Kojima said, “I’m going to be very honest, we have been testing the game with players and the results are too good. They like it too much. That means something is wrong; we have to change something…If everyone likes it, it means it’s mainstream. It means it’s conventional. It means it’s already pre-digested for people to like it.”</span></p> <p><span>I’ve been thinking about this quote now for months. As a player, as a reader, as a movie lover, I value work that has some integrity to it. I don’t like it when I’m playing a game and I can </span><i><span>feel </span></i><span>the designers straining to make it all as convenient and frictionless and pleasant as possible. That doesn’t mean that I like having my time wasted either, or that I don’t value good design. I just don’t like it when things feel focus-tested, sanded down, made all glossy for the masses. Sometimes I will think a popular, mainstream work is very good, but it won’t be </span><i><span>because </span></i><span>of the ways in which I sense it calibrating itself for mass appeal. It will be in spite of them.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This year, I played a number of games I thought were fine, and a few I didn’t like very much. I didn’t play many that I found really special or exciting, so this list is a top five, not a top ten. That’s not a commentary on the overall quality of the year’s games. It’s just a reflection of the fact that I played fewer games overall this year than I sometimes do–I’m trying to make more time for books, movies, and so on than I have in the past, and to spend more time with people I care about, too–and that, of the games I happened to play in my limited time, not all of them were winners. But I did still play some very good games this year. Let’s get on with it, shall we?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <hr> <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Death Stranding 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Man, what a frustrating game for me to grapple with. The original </span><i><span>Death Stranding </span></i><span>is an all-time favorite of mine, a bold, bracing experience that was truly unlike anything I had played and that has only become more strangely resonant in the years since its release. This sequel, despite that secondhand Kojima quote I shared above about him apparently not wanting it to be too “mainstream,” felt to me very safe, leaning into conventional combat and away from the kinds of environmental friction that made forming connections in the first game so rewarding. It also, as Maddy Myers so effectively noted in </span><a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-women-of-death-stranding-2-are-stuck-in-a-sad-cycle"><span>a piece for </span><i><span>The A.V. Club</span></i></a><span>, exemplifies Kojima’s tiresome tendency toward gender essentialism.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But amidst the typical AAA gunfights and deeply disappointing narrative decisions, there were still some cool discoveries and memorable moments. I loved it when I hopped in a hot spring only to find that taking a bath in one can transport you to another; this felt to me not like another “quality of life”-oriented fast-travel option, something non-diegetic you select in a menu, but a feature of the world, the way Warp Zones used to be. And as I wrote about in our piece on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>the year’s best moments</span></a><span>, the game’s big reveal near the end is goofy, exuberant, and audacious, a reminder of what Kojima can do when he’s truly willing to take risks.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG was refreshingly distinctive, with a world recalling that of </span><i><span>Morrowind </span></i><span>in its originality rather than more traditional swords-and-sorcery settings. I enjoyed wandering around and seeing who and what I would find more than I have in a game like this in a long time. It also tells a tale in which, depending on your actions, some pretty major events </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-steel-garrote-cave-fior-mes-iverno-burns-1851767974"><span>can happen or not happen</span></a><span>, and I appreciated that it found ways to confront some pretty big themes and incorporate some impactful choices while working within some clear limitations of budget and scope. </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>punches above its weight and proves that big mid-budget adventures still deserve a place in today’s gaming landscape.</span></p>

 <h2><b>#5: </b><b><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656282">©DotEmu</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2020’s </span><i><span>Streets of Rage 4 </span></i><span>was the best damn beat ‘em up I’d played in a long time. With it, co-developer Guard Crush demonstrated a real knack for the fundamentals of the genre, delivering clobbering action that was accessible, nuanced, and so, </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> satisfying. This year’s </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>sees them take all that savoir-faire and apply it to fantasy beat ‘em up action with roguelike elements, and it works as well as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I really dig a good fantasy beat ‘em up (Capcom’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>games of the ‘90s are particular favorites), and </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>makes great use of its setting, peppering in just enough lore to tell us what we need to know about its central conflict and to understand the personalities of its four terrific playable characters. It also benefits from a striking art style that had me feeling like I was playing a lush fantasy cartoon from the 1970s. Random events and hidden secrets keep the world feeling lively, and going toe-to-toe with its terrific bosses is as enjoyable on your 20th run as it is on your first.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#4: </b><b><i>Despelote&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656283">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you have a passion for something, especially when you’re young, it stays with you everywhere. It’s with you when you’re wandering the halls of your school, when you’re hanging out with your friends, when you’re lying in bed at night. Some passions separate you from others; my high school obsession with Peter Gabriel wasn’t something I could really share with my friends who were into Nirvana and Pearl Jam, for instance. But sometimes, a passion binds you with others. Sometimes, it binds a whole nation together.</span></p> <p><i><span>Despelote </span></i><span>is a slice-of-life game about an Ecuadorian boy named Julián and the weeks surrounding the country’s qualifying run for the 2002 World Cup. Julián loves soccer. At home, his parents make dinner and talk about the changing state of the world and the latest challenges in their careers, but Julián just wants to play the soccer game on his console and hog the family TV. During recess at school, he and his classmates immediately seize the opportunity to kick the ball around. Everywhere you go in </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>, soccer is woven seamlessly into life. People are still going on dates and exercising and walking their dogs, but soccer is in the air, inescapable. The game doesn’t need to didactically explain to you what qualifying for the World Cup would mean to the country, to these people. Thanks to </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>’s brilliant blend of realism and surrealism, you’re there, in that space, living it. You can feel it yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a common misconception about “relatability” which says that the more generic a work is, the more relatable it is because it means that we’ll all be more readily able to project ourselves onto its characters and connect to its situations. I find it’s almost always the opposite that is true. The more specific something is, the more precisely it captures an experience that is not my own, the better I’m able to feel connected to it as well, to appreciate both how it differs from my own experience and how it reflects the things that bind us all together. I’m not a soccer fan, and I’m sorry to say that I know woefully little about the history of Ecuador. But when I reached the game’s incredible climactic moment, which I wrote about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>here</span></a><span>, I practically stood up and cheered. I get it now. Sometimes, soccer really is life.</span></p> <h2><b>#3: </b><b><i>Terminator 2D: No Fate</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653424"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653424">© Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Finally, we have the game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, a game that truly captures the movie’s pulse-pounding action and distinctive visual sensibilities. More than just a good licensed game (which is rare enough in itself), </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>immediately establishes itself as one of the best arcade-style run-and-gun action games of all time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve heard a few people criticize the game for its brevity. It certainly is short, but I wouldn’t want it to be longer. A full playthrough of </span><i><span>Contra III: The Alien Wars</span></i><span>, one of the other greats in the genre, takes maybe 30 minutes, but it’s so jam-packed with showstopping setpieces and memorable moments that half an hour feels like a perfect length to me; after that, I’m ready to try for a higher score or tackle a tougher difficulty. The same principle applies here; a runthrough of </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>might take 45 minutes or so (there are three possible routes through the game and some are longer than others), and when it’s over, I’m ready to catch my breath and then give it another shot. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>makes repeated attempts rewarding with a scoring system that sees you keep building up a multiplier as long as you don’t take damage; I’ve already seen some </span><a href="https://barbarian.men/macaw45/2645969570#24130"><span>amazing efforts to get high scores</span></a><span> that show off some really skilled, high-level play. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>also makes harder difficulty options worthwhile, changing enemy placement and behavior to make the game tougher in an interesting way rather than just going the route of giving enemies more health.</span></p> <p><span>But ultimately it’s the stage design, pixel art, and wonderfully precise controls that make this game a masterpiece. It constantly keeps you on your toes, tossing you from future war run-and-gun scenarios to breathless vehicle chases to stealthy prison escapes, all animated beautifully and moving along at an exhilarating pace. A number of fairly high-profile games this year tried to recapture and build on the excitement offered by some of the best 2D sidescrollers of the ‘80s and ‘90s, but for my money, this is the only one that really knocked it out of the park. It’s a total banger.</span></p> <h2><span>&nbsp;</span><b>#2: </b><b><i>Blippo+</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656284">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I watched some crap on TV when I was young of course, </span><i><span>He-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Knight Rider </span></i><span>and whatnot, but TV also often felt like a way to broaden my horizons. In the ‘90s, I think channel surfing and stumbling on cool, random shit was a pretty common experience for people, and it was certainly one I had time and again. I liked venturing into the world of TV without consulting a </span><i><span>Guide</span></i><span> and just seeing what I’d find. Maybe </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKl6B2CX2tY"><span>Huell Howser</span></a><span> would show me some aspect of California history I was unfamiliar with, or I might catch the end of an R-rated movie, all the swears </span><a href="https://youtu.be/H-y1PAUtv3k?si=lHDS0sJOocQwJqpq"><span>hilariously dubbed over</span></a><span> for broadcast TV, that blew my mind. TV was a gateway to learning about nature, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr3JfDYpjt0?si=gNvo77FQdI-PseKL"><span>being exposed to art</span></a><span>, and sometimes just seeing human beings doing weird and interesting things.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>recaptures that feeling of just flipping through the channels and stumbling on good stuff. Its varied assortment of programs–ostensibly signals from an alien planet much like our own–includes game shows, talk shows, cooking shows, science shows, news programs, and more, each with its own distinct vibe, yet united by a cohesive aesthetic that gives the whole thing the fuzzy warmth and genuine humanity of, say, old Bob Ross episodes or other PBS programming funded by viewers like you. But </span><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>is more than just a collection of TV shows, it’s also a fascinating narrative experience that immerses us in a culture on the brink of potentially radical change. A better world is possible, and the revolution just might be televised.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#1: </b><b><i>Shadow Labyrinth</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656287">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Okay, I need you to understand something. I was very young when Pac-Man became the world’s first video game superstar, but I do remember it. And look, Pac-Man was everywhere; in cartoons, on t-shirts and magazine covers, in hit pop songs. But here’s the thing: there was no one singular image of Pac-Man. On arcade cabinets, he looked like an armless yellow blob. In </span><a href="https://www.gamesdatabase.org/media/atari-5200/artwork-box/pac-man"><span>the box art for the Atari 5200 version</span></a><span>, he looked like a sleek floating sphere. In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9blzq0/my_coworker_worked_at_atari_in_the_80s_heres_her/"><span>this stunning envisioning</span></a><span> by Japanese artist Hiro Kimura, apparently rejected by Atari due to its terrifying rendition of the ghosts, Pac-Man is a little metallic robot man gobbling wafers and wearing track shorts and a Pac-Man t-shirt.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656285">©Atari</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nowadays, established video game characters often have their appearance totally standardized, and every incarnation of them has to be “on-model.” Earlier this year, for instance, when Donkey Kong started </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-new-design-1851742086"><span>sporting a slightly altered look</span></a><span>, we all took notice, and knew that this decision had been made and approved by Nintendo on high. But when I was young, video game characters were in flux. I was free to imagine Pac-Man in any number of ways, none of them “canonically” accurate but all of them feeling like they reflected, in some way, the strange, abstract experience of playing </span><i><span>Pac-Man</span></i><span>. I miss the feeling that game characters exist as much in the realm of the imagination as they do on the screen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now I need you to understand something else. When I was young, the world was just trying to figure out what video games </span><i><span>meant</span></i><span>, how they might function as part of our society and our artistic landscape. </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, a formative viewing experience for me, imagined worlds within our computers in which these games actually played out, while </span><i><span>The Last Starfighter </span></i><span>suggested that an arcade cabinet could be an intergalactic test of skill, a way to find the fighter pilot who could accomplish in real life what the game asked them to do onscreen. And I was a kid with a very overactive imagination. My home life was, shall we say, not great, and at school I mostly felt like a weirdo who didn’t really understand how to interact with the world around me. But in games, I could be capable, heroic even. And so, at six or seven, I would sometimes imagine that, as in </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, whatever I was seeing on my screen was actually happening in some other realm somewhere, and that maybe my actions were making a difference.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A link to the past</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656277">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you first fire up </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, the start menu screen shows a figure in a city on a rainy night, sitting on a bench and playing a gaming handheld. As soon as you launch the game, the figure disappears, their device abandoned on the ground. The game’s intro, a cavalcade of over-the-top anime nonsense, shows a human soul being summoned from beyond into the body that will serve as the game’s player character. To me, the implication seemed clear: the game is suggesting that we and the player character are literally one, that we have been summoned into the world of the game to help right whatever might be wrong in this strange world. And though I no longer give myself over to my imagination the way I did when I was six, I enjoyed the imaginative playfulness of this choice, the way it seemed to ask me to remember that part of myself that once believed that video games were one part technology, one part magic. Games don’t always activate that part of me anymore. It’s a nice surprise when they do.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From that point on, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>continued to surprise me. I went in expecting a modest game, one that might take me 12 hours or so and offer some standard Metroidvania enjoyment. Instead, its world kept expanding beyond my expectations, surprising me both with its scale and its strangeness. Not since my first time playing </span><i><span>Symphony of the Night </span></i><span>has a game’s world impressed and bewildered me so much.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And now I want to go back to that Kojima quote I kicked things off with. At no point, in any way, did </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>ever feel “pre-digested” for my enjoyment. Its moment-to-moment gameplay felt fine, but it didn’t have that luscious quality that so many games strive for. And I </span><i><span>like</span></i><span> this about it. If you transport me to some other world, I’m not gonna be some badass ninja. It felt like some situation I had stumbled into and was making the best of; what I never felt was the concern of the developers, obsessing over some need to make the game feel the way games like </span><i><span>Hades </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>do. It felt as if the controls simply…were.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656286"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656286">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Similarly, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>never seemed concerned with me understanding exactly what I needed to do next, or with me being able to conveniently find a save spot, or with me understanding its strange story. It all felt, top to bottom, like a true journey of </span><i><span>discovery</span></i><span>, in ways that games, in my experience, so rarely do these days. I loved simply stumbling upon references to Bandai Namco properties other than Pac-Man. (The first time I found myself in an area with the enemies from </span><i><span>Dig Dug</span></i><span>, I gasped in delight.) I loved needing to remember for myself where I might find some type of enemy I needed to fight to acquire some item. I loved figuring out for myself how to hunt down and defeat a boss who looked like a physical manifestation of </span><i><span>Pac Man</span></i><span>’s famous killscreen glitch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m very well aware that </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>was made by developers. But I admire this game so much more because they worked so hard to make it feel as if it </span><i><span>wasn’t</span></i><span>, as if this really is just a strange, hostile world that we’ve been thrust into. The part of my imagination that this game reawakened likes to think that perhaps this game is the “true story,” the real place where games like </span><i><span>Pac Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Galaga </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dig Dug </span></i><span>all come from, and those arcade games were little echoes of this world, little dreamlike manifestations of it, brought into our world by the Namco game designers of the 1980’s.</span></p> <p><span>With </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, Bandai Namco eschewed the tendency toward safety and standardization that sometimes limits games themselves and how we allow ourselves to imagine them. I never once felt the developers looking over my shoulder, worrying about whether I was getting frustrated or finding it all “well-designed” enough. This is a game in which the rules that say a character needs to be a certain thing or look a certain way don’t apply at all, an expression of that wild range of possibility that surrounds games when we set them free from specific ideas of appearance or genre and let them coalesce into something strange, risky, and new. </span></p>

  </picture><p>These moments of survival are broken up into Big Days. Big Days represent substantive events like mammoth hunts, cave bear attacks, and clashes with rival tribes. Between these events, you must gather food, craft tools and weapons, and consult shamans for guidance. Once these events happen, break out the miniatures and the dice. These skirmishes and hunts are resolved using a d10-based alternating activation system.</p><p>The core experience of <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is its detailed campaign system. The ultimate goal is survival. This means, even if the dice are against you while fighting other tribes, your group can still thrive in the long run.</p><p>The game is the tabletop debut of Austin Hunt. According to his bio, Hunt has been a war gamer for over two decades, playing in multiple games across different genres. The book features illustrations by Netherlands artist Mars Oosterveld, whose work has also featured in <em>Paleomythic</em>.</p><p>Osprey Games is known for a diverse catalog of skirmish games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Pragmata captured my attention way back in *checks notes* 2020 (wow). I finally played Pragmata earlier this year at Gamescom and walked away both thoroughly impressed and annoyed with Capcom for making my demo only 20 minutes long. Following a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025, which showed off new gameplay in New York City, an engaging reprieve from the lunar station that’s been heavily showcased so far, Capcom released a demo for the game; it’s basically what I played earlier this year and I can’t recommend it enough. It quickly highlights how unique Pragmata’s gameplay is, which mixes third-person gunplay with real-time hacking minigames.</p><p>“From the start, the core vision was a buddy-action experience where you would control two distinct characters with a single controller,” Pragmata director Yongchee Cho tells me. The team explored giving protagonist Hugh a small drone that aids him in combat, but once the developers landed on the android Diana as a second protagonist, this idea evolved into the hacking system. This created various layers of gameplay that all happen at once, and when coupled with the mysterious narrative and various locales warped and twisted by Luna Filament, the name Pragmata makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The word comes from Greek, meaning things, actions, or facts, and in philosophy, it connects to pragmatism,” Cho tells me. “A single word carrying so many layers of meaning felt like the perfect fit for the story and world of this game.”&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of that Luna Filament, it's the stuff that's causing New York City's Times Square to look so different in the latest Pragmata trailer, and that's not the only location that will be transformed by this mysterious substance. Cho says it's key to the sci-fi world Capcom is creating in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We want players to enjoy diving into the unique sci-fi world that defines Pragmata, and not just the protagonists and their interactions," he says. "You'll come across areas warped by Luna Filament, where strange reactions and irregular structures create an atmosphere that feels both alien and intriguing. The game is full of moments and locales that spark curiosity, whether you're into sci-fi or not, and those surprises run throughout the game.</p><p>"Personally, I can't wait to see the incredible, super-plays players pull off once they get their hands on it."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Those super-plays will be performed throughout Pragmata by the two unlikely protagonists, Hugh and Diana. Cho says Hugh tends to be laid-back and reluctant, but has a strong sense of responsibility. It's no surprise, then, that he teams up with Diana.&nbsp;</p><p>"At first glance, he might seem distant, yet deep down, he's a kind person," Cho adds. "Diana might have felt like a burden early on, but through their explorations of the space station, he gradually starts to see her as someone he truly wants to help. We worked hard to express that side of Hugh's character, not only in dialogue, but also during combat throughout the game."&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, Cho describes Diana as an android girl with vast AI knowledge but little real-world experience, making her a perfect fit for Hugh. "She's full of curiosity about a world she knows almost nothing about," Cho says. "She originally intended to stay on the Moon, but meeting Hugh gives her a new purpose, and she chooses to travel with him. As they journey together, learning from Hugh's experience, Diana becomes increasingly fascinated by Earth and eager to discover more."&nbsp;</p><p>The Moon, Earth, and other settings we'll visit in Pragmata are inspired by all manner of media, Cho tells me. "The character-driven story takes cues from human drama; the visual world borrows ideas from animation and Hollywood films; and the mechanical design and presentation are influenced by Japanese animation," he says. "Of course, it's not just about inspiration. We've blended these influences while preserving the unique atmosphere that makes Pragmata stand apart."&nbsp;</p><p>Pragmata launches in April, so we don't have to wait long to see whether it really stands out from its inspirations. If what we've played so far is any indication – and don't forget, you can check out a Pragmata demo right now – Cho and team are on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata]]></content:encoded>
