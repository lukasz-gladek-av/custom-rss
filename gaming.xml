<p>Triumphant Light is the second-ever mini-set in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every card is new, each one is hotter than a Charmander’s tail, and secret missions and rewards await if you can collect specific ones.</p>



<p>Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket consistently ushers new sets into the mobile title. We’ve had a healthy mix of main sets and mini-sets, each one trying to outdo the last.

<p>There are four secret missions in total to complete. Each Triumphant Light secret mission requires you to collect certain cards from the mini-set. Many of them are Full Arts and Rares, meaning it could take time to collect every single one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-1-3-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-in-12-hours.1121844/</guid>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has already hit 1.3 million concurrent players on Steam in just 12 hours after its release.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, the game is currently in the number one seller spot, despite having a ‘Mixed’ review rating from 9000+ reviews.</p>



<p>The concurrent player player count currently places Monster Hunter Wilds in seventh place, with sixth and fifth place (Dota 2 and Lost Ark) only within an additional 30,000 players. </p>



<p>Traditionally, Friday game releases usually see a bigger concurrent growth number on the weekend, so it’s currently unclear on where the game will finish with its player count.</p>



<p>As mentioned, the games release hasn’t been without its problems though, with many players complain of poor performance issues and a lack of opimisation.</p>



<p>“This game is absolutely amazing – but has the worst optimisation I’ve ever seen,” said one Steam user.</p>



<p>He continued, “I understand that new games are becoming more demanding and people are expected to upgrade, but this is absurd. I’m aware this isn’t the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.”</p>



<p>Another user said, “How does a game manage to run perfectly fine in the Open Beta AND I receive an Excellent rating score on the benchmark but the actual product that costs ACTUAL MONEY runs like absolute sludge. I have legit never encountered a game that wasn’t at worst playable. I have never seen a game run this poorly while still looking this bad.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a> has since <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/1895397927557980292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a> to the complaints on X (formerly Twitter), with suggestions on how to improve performance. </p>



<p>“Hunters! If you’re experiencing any initial issues with Monster Hunter Wilds on Steam, please try updating your graphics driver, turning off compatibility mode, and then readjust your settings,” they said.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shroud-by-adrian-tchaikovsky-review.1121841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shroud-adrian-tchaikovsky-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cosmic horror, along with sci-fi in general, is a difficult genre to get right. It thrives on the unknown, the creeping sensation that something is just out of sight, not entirely clear, itching at your reality. But, if you don't get the balance right, you'll end up with a galaxy wide narrative that's as deep as a puddle. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3R2JM?object_uuid=02686557-58f3-4b11-8a97-6c1f089007cb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Shroud</a> understands this well, twisting its story in ways that leave you adrift in its dark world. It’s a book that revels in disorientation, pulling you deeper into its mysteries the more you struggle to grasp them. When it’s at its best, it makes you feel lost in all the right ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shroud is an utterly gripping story of alien encounter and survival from Adrian Tchaikovsky, author of the Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning <a href="https://zdcs.link/9lXNPr?object_uuid=02686557-58f3-4b11-8a97-6c1f089007cb&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Children of Time</a>, and paints a grim and grotesque vision of the future, where humanity’s expansion into the cosmos is as much a test of endurance (and capitalist hell) as it is a descent into existential dread. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The descriptions of Shroud itself—its tendrils curling through the void, the sensation of alien briar tightening around the atmosphere—are striking. The opening chapters, in particular, are a masterclass in setting the tone, so much so that I found myself rereading them just to soak in their gnarly brilliance again and again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shroud constantly shifts, leaving you unmoored in a way that mirrors the characters’ own descent into fear and uncertainty.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tchaikovsky’s writing heavily leans into ambiguity, using a mix of perspectives and deliberately vague language to reinforce the unknowable nature of Shroud and its horrors. The book constantly shifts, leaving you unmoored in a way that mirrors the characters’ own descent into fear and uncertainty. Alien encounters are presented in strange, fragmented imagery filled with mind-bending metaphors and comparisons rather than overtly explicit detail, making them all the more unsettling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The prose itself even feels unstable at times, as if the words are bending under the weight of something beyond comprehension. Tchaikovsky does his best at making the sci-fi elements accessible, but it’s still a style that won’t work for everyone—those looking for clear explanations or firm resolutions may find themselves frustrated at times—but it’s undeniably effective at immersing you in a world that feels utterly alien.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The characters, particularly Juna Ceelander and Mai Ste Etienne, are an interesting study in detachment. They begin as almost intentionally blank slates, their personalities stripped down to what’s necessary to survive in their assigned roles. There’s a sense that they’re meant to be shaped by their time on Shroud, and they do develop more emotion as they struggle against its horrors. Yet there's also moments they also regress, hollowed out by their experiences for the faceless corporate machine that sent them there in the first place.</p><div catalogid="1ff25769-bfaf-4361-a120-85a33d507925" id="215934"><div id="215934" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shroud by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>"A commercial expedition to a distant star system discovers a pitch-black moon alive with radio activity. Its high-gravity, high-pressure, zero-oxygen environment is deadly to human life, but ripe for exploitation. They named it Shroud."</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Shroud excels at mood and mystery, it stumbles slightly when it tries to settle into a more structured narrative. The middle section loses some of that hypnotic unease, instead slipping into a “monster of the chapter” rhythm that, while functional, feels at odds with the book’s more unsettling moments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the storytelling equivalent of an explosion in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/20/aquaman-review">Aquaman</a>—it gets things moving, but not always in a way that feels as meaningful as the world Tchaikovsky has built. Thankfully, the book finds its footing again in the final stretch, closing things out with an inevitably bleak, bittersweet flourish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What stood out to me most was how Shroud shares themes with something like The Expanse, with heeps of gritty realism and criticisms of modern capitalism, but Tchaikovsky has made his narrative that bit more intimate, spending most of its time in the minds of a few lost souls rather than sprawling across a grand political landscape. It’s a story of survival, in a bitter, mysterious sci-fi setting, that also manages to explore where we are now, where we could go, and whether there’s anything worth holding onto when we get there.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 28, 2025 1:02 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Few books capture the creeping dread of cosmic horror as well as Shroud. Its world is as mysterious as it is horrifying, drawing you into its briar grip with unsettlingly vivid descriptions and a story that keeps you just off-balance enough to be enthralling. While the middle act dips into a more formulaic structure, it’s ultimately a minor stumble in an otherwise absorbing descent into madness and survival. Fans of The Expanse’s grounded sci-fi grit will find much to appreciate, though Shroud trades political intrigue for a more intimate, sci-fi horror.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-monster-hunter-took-over-the-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the leadup to its global launch, Monster Hunter Wilds broke pre-order records on both Steam and PlayStation. It effortlessly followed in the footsteps of its extraordinarily popular predecessors, 2022’s Monster Hunter Rise and 2018’s Monster Hunter: World, achieving sales that truly cements Capcom’s unique and esoteric RPG series as one of the biggest video game franchises in the whole world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn’t always the case. Less than a decade ago, the idea of a Monster Hunter game attaining such remarkable popularity across the globe would have seemed alien. Rewind the clock even further, back to when Monster Hunter hit the scene in 2004, and it would have seemed even more farfetched: the original game was met with mixed reviews. It wasn’t until a year later when Monster Hunter made the jump to the PSP did the series really blow up… in Japan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right. For a long time, Monster Hunter was the poster child for the “game series bigger in Japan than the rest of the world” phenomenon. The reasons for this were simple, as this story will explain, but that didn’t stop Capcom from trying to figure out how to break Monster Hunter through to the international market. And, as Monster Hunters World, Rise, and now Wilds proves, it was well worth the effort. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is how Monster Hunter went from a domestic hit to a global force.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/23/monsterhunterwilds-blogroll-1740345114820.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter Wilds is already proving to be immensely popular. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Around the time of Street Fighter 5’s launch in 2016, Capcom underwent an internal reorganization in order to prepare for a new generation of games. These games would run on the company’s brand new RE Engine, a replacement for Capcom’s ageing MT Framework. But this change was about more than just tools. Alongside the engine upgrade came a new mandate to ensure Capcom’s games were being made not just for existing, territory-specific fans, but for a global audience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was a few factors that came together,” says Hideaki Itsuno, a former game director at Capcom best known for his work on Devil May Cry. “The change of the engine and also all teams were given a very clear goal at that point to make games that reach the global market. [Games] that are fun for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you look at almost all of Capcom’s games released during the PS3 and Xbox 360 era, you get the feeling that the company was going all-in on trying to capture an imagined version of the “Western games market.” The action-heavy Resident Evil 4 was a big hit, true. But the more gun-focused spinoffs like Umbrella Corps, as well as the sci-fi shooter series Lost Planet, were all clearly chasing late-2000s Western gaming trends to no avail. After several years, Capcom realized it needed to create games that could appeal to everyone, not just fans of traditional Western genres.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All teams were given a very clear goal to make games that reach the global market.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that we had that clear goal of just focusing and not holding anything back,” Itsuno says. “Towards making good games that would reach people from all over the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Itsuno notes that the time leading up to 2017 was pivotal. “The changes in organization and the changes in the engine, all these elements came together around that time,” he says. When Resident Evil 7 launched that year, it kickstarted a Capcom renaissance. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">No other series embodies this new company goal for global success better than Monster Hunter. While it had its diehard fans in the West, for decades Monster Hunter was much, much bigger in Japan than the rest of the world. The series was never conceived to be something that was only big in Japan, but there were real-world factors as to why this happened. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, Monster Hunter found tremendous success moving from PlayStation 2 to the PSP with Monster Hunter Freedom Unite. The handheld gaming market has always been much stronger in Japan than in the West, as seen with the success of not just the PSP but also Nintendo’s DS and, more recently, the Switch. The popularity of handhelds in Japan is rooted in a number of factors, but the thing that really worked for Monster Hunter, according to the series’ executive producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, was that Japanese gamers were able to reliably play with friends thanks to the nation’s heavily developed wireless internet network. It was years ahead of anything available in the United States at the time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/27/monster-hunter-freedom-unite-1740657423774.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter Freedom Unite saw the series arrive on PSP, a pivotal moment for Japanese gamers. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“20 years ago, Japan was in a very, very solid state in terms of the network environments available to people, and being able to connect and to play online together,” Tsujimoto says. “And of course, we’re not speaking for everyone there, because we realize that there are people who may not have had the chance to play with friends back then. But by moving over to handheld systems, we were able to grow that player base that was interacting and playing multiplayer together.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter, which is built on a core pillar of cooperative play, recognized that this aspect would best be served when friends could quickly jump into hunts together. There was no better avenue for that at the time than handheld consoles. Thanks to Japan’s advanced internet, it meant Monster Hunter was being developed for a local market first, even if that wasn’t an intentional approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This created a loop of sorts. Monster Hunter games would become best-sellers primarily in Japan, and to keep pace with the audience, Capcom would release Japan-only content and host Japan-only special events, further reinforcing Monster Hunter as a “Japan-only” brand.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Monster Hunter did have fans in the West, and they were enviously looking from the outside in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the reality was that Monster Hunter did have fans in the West, and they were enviously looking from the outside in as Japanese players received exclusive tie-ins and quests. But as the Western world improved its internet infrastructure and online play became practically mandatory for most console gamers, Tsujimoto and the team saw an opportunity to launch their most advanced and most globally-accessible Monster Hunter game to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in 2018 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, Monster Hunter: World was a gigantic change for the franchise. Rather than being scoped for small, less-capable handheld consoles, it delivered large-scale, AAA console quality action with souped up graphics, bigger areas, and, of course, bigger monsters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our approach to the globalization of the series and Monster Hunter in general really ties into not only the themes that we had going into designing the game, but also in the name of the game,” Tsujimoto reveals. “The fact that we called it Monster Hunter: World is really kind of a nod to the fact that we wanted to appeal to this worldwide audience that we wanted to really dig into and experience Monster Hunter for the first time.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/26/mhworld-e3screen6-bmp-jpgcopy-1498485150528.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter: World was a turning point for the series, turning it into a true global phenomenon. | Image credit: Capcom</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It was also vital that Monster Hunter: World not do anything that gave off the impression that Capcom was prioritizing one market over the other. Monster Hunter: World would be released simultaneously worldwide, and there wouldn’t be exclusive content locked to Japan, something Tsujimoto says “comes with realigning ourselves to hit those global standards that people come to expect of titles around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just a matter of making sure other regions got Monster Hunter: World at the same time as Japan (though it certainly helped). Tsujimoto and co. drilled deep to see what other ways Monster Hunter’s formula could be tweaked to broaden its appeal with players from all around the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We did focus tests and user tests across the world, and some of the impact of those — the feedback and the opinions that we got during that really affected how we designed our game systems and really affected how much success we had as a global title for that game,” Tsujimoto says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One important change that resulted from these playtests was simply showing damage numbers when players hit the monsters. Little tweaks here and there to an already successful formula drove Monster Hunter to the greatest heights it had ever reached. Previous Monster Hunter games had typically sold around 1.3 to 5 million copies, not including re-releases and special editions. Monster Hunter: World and its 2022 follow-up, Monster Hunter Rise, both recorded sales greater than 20 million copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This explosion of player growth didn’t happen by accident. Instead of changing the spirit of Monster Hunter to suit Western tastes, Tsujimoto and the team found ways to open up the series’ unique (and, admittedly, obtuse) nature to a wider audience without making sacrifices. This approach continues with the series’ latest game, Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At its heart, Monster Hunter really is an action game, and that sense of accomplishment you get from really mastering that action is an important aspect of Monster Hunter,” Tsujimoto explains. “But for newer players, it's really getting to that point. The steps involved in getting to that sense of accomplishment is really what we're trying to strategize for, in terms of designing for new players. So with World and Rise, for example, we were taking really great care to analyze where players got stuck, what was hard to understand, what they were having trouble with, getting player feedback, and also doing our own kind of research into that. And all of that kind of knowledge has impacted how we've implemented new systems into Wilds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within 35 minutes of its release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lj7ow3nz5l2m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter Wilds hit 738,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, a figure more than double Monster Hunter: World's all-time high. And so there’s every chance that Capcom's latest hunt may go on to quickly exceed even World and Rise’s lofty achievements. And thanks to a collection of glowing reviews and the promise of more content to come, it seems incredibly likely that Monster Hunter Wilds will continue the series’ mission to take over the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article is an excerpt from an upcoming IGN story that explores how Capcom turned itself around after a chain of missteps and failures.

Microtransactions are common to in live-service games, as studios and publishers who make them want a recurring stream of revenue.</p><p>Microtransactions can seem appealing, as players are offered a constant stream of new content such as cosmetics. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/microtransactions-are-getting-out-of-hand-spot-on/2300-6461962/" data-ref-id="2300-6461962">players have expressed concern</a> that microtransactions have gotten out of hand, as they feel like they're being squeezed for every bit of cash.</p><p>Hazelight specializes in co-op games, and their games are consumer friendly in that they often offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-cross-play-and-friends-pass-free-access-explained/1100-6529627/" data-ref-id="1100-6529627">Friend Pass</a> so that only one person needs to purchase Split Fiction in order to play with another.</p><p>Ironically, all of Hazelight's games so far have been published by Electronic Arts, whose CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">said that AI will drive microtransaction sales</a>.

<p>Writing on social media, general manager of Diablo Rod Fergusson revealed development was taking a little longer than originally anticipated, but did soften the news by teasing "an old 'friend'" was making a return.</p>

<p>"In the spirit of serving the game, not the plan, Season 8 will take a couple of weeks longer to bake than we initially anticipated," Fergusson wrote.</p>

<p>That "old 'friend'" has got players excited - and speculating. Whilst Fergusson couldn't be drawn on who that friend - or foe, as the case may be - is, fans have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1izvosa/an_update_on_season_8_from_rod/">suggesting</a> all kinds of characters, from to Cain to Covetous Shen to Lyndon. Others posit it could be the return of Lorath, Tyrael, Zoltun Kulle, Eirena, or Kormac.</p>
<p>Right now, it's unclear exactly how long the season will be delayed for, but we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ed reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-backtracks-on-diablo-4-annual-expansions-next-due-in-2026">Diablo 4's next expansion won't arrive until 2026</a>, marking a change in its annual plans.</p>
<p>Fergusson made the announcement at a DICE panel event, saying: "In 2025, or just before Season 8, we will have a 2025 roadmap for Diablo 4.</p>
<p>"Now, our second expansion won't be on that roadmap, because our second expansion is coming in 2026, but at least players will have the road ahead."</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The old adage ‘you get what you pay for’ is generally a sensible one to live by, but while it used to hold so very true for gaming peripherals, there’s a bunch of brands that are challenging the status quo. It used to be that cheap non-official controllers were reserved for younger siblings in the 90s and 00s, before the rise of pro controllers saw £200 pieces of kit roundly surpass something a quarter of its price.&nbsp;Times have changed, though, and GameSir are proving that saying wrong, as the Cyclone 2 is one of the best gaming controllers we’ve ever seen, and it costs just £50.</p>
<p><iframe title="GameSir Cyclone 2 - Pro for Everyone | Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ifeU_WcFwiA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Cyclone 2 is a wireless multiplatform controller, usable with PC and Nintendo Switch via its 2.4GHz USB-A dongle, as well as iOS, Android and Smart TVs via Bluetooth. In the box you get the controller, a metre-long cable and, for an extra £5, a nifty metal charging dock that magnetically hangs onto the Cyclone 2 when it’s not in use. The dock itself also has a USB socket for the dongle, so you only need one USB port to get it all hooked up. It’s smart, sturdy, and makes living with the Cyclone 2 a very easy sell.</p>


<p>Available in black or white, our review unit came in white, with gold detailing and bold red highlights around each analogue stick. Rather than being a solid colour, it fades from the top to translucency at the bottom. That’s handy because the Cyclone 2 boasts some of those fancy RGB lights inside so that it glows in a spectrum of colours. There’s a limited amount of customisation available via the controller itself, which is a shame, but you can dive deeper into the different light effects in the GameSir Connect software. Overall, the Cyclone 2 is an eye-catching controller, and it looks stylish and modern.</p>


<p>Based on the layout and form of the Xbox Series X|S controller, the Cyclone 2 feels immediately comfortable in your hand. There’s textured plastic here to help give you a bit more grip, but where this would typically be only on the underside of each arm, as on the Xbox controller, I really like that it actually goes all the way round to the top side of the controller as well.</p>
<p>The main face buttons and the D-pad all use microswitches, and they feel fantastic. At this pricepoint, the level of build quality is frankly ridiculous, and it makes the official Xbox controller it’s modelled on feel positively stone-age in comparison. The shoulder buttons are responsive despite missing out on the microswitches, and they have a full range of use, even at the far corner away from the button mechanism itself.</p>

<p>Here’s where things get really interesting though. Firstly, the analogue sticks feel amazing. These are Hall Effect sticks – they’re in most new controllers now, but the long and the short of it is that they’ll last longer than traditional sticks. They’re tuned a touch stiffer than the Xbox controller or Sony’s DualSense, and I love the feel of them in use. They’re also absolutely perfect in terms of accuracy, both achieving 100% on Gamepad Tester. They’re not the only star of this controller show, though.</p>
<p>The triggers are also Hall Effect, utilising the same magnetic sensors to ensure that they’ll live up to years of hammering. They also include my favourite combination of technologies, with a lockout switch in the seat of the trigger not just swapping the full range of the trigger, but altering the input into a microswitch digital button. It’s sublime. It makes the Cyclone 2 perfect for twitchy FPSs as much as RPGs – I’ve hammered mine for both Overwatch 2 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/19/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-preview-the-last-great-wii-u-switch-port/">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> – and it’s been seamless moving between the two.</p>

<p>The only question mark I have is that the lockout switch is quite small, and if there’s one part of the Cyclone 2 that I’d wonder how well it’ll hold up to thousands of movements, it would be this one. That said, it’s shown no signs of any wear through our use, and I’m willing to trust GameSir’s quality control and testing when the rest of the controller is as good as it is.</p>
<p>The Cyclone 2 boasts two large back paddles which sit comfortably underneath your fingers. They are made from extremely smooth plastic, which is a little disconcerting at first, but you soon get used to them. I think I’d have preferred them to be textured, but it’s a minor gripe. The fact that there’s only two back paddles may make hardcore users sniff, but for my personal use case, I generally find two to be more reliable, simply because there’s a reduced chance of pressing the wrong button.</p>

<p>Beyond the paddles, the menu buttons on the front of the controller include a central ‘Home’-style button, the Xbox-like Menu, Options and Share buttons and then an additional ‘M’ button between the D-pad and right analogue stick that lets you alter the RGB options, rumble levels and back button mapping on the fly. It’s a very simple and intuitive system, and I was surprised by how much functionality GameSir were able to cram in by combining it with other inputs.</p>
<p>If you want to dive into the customisation further you can use Gamesir’s Connect software for PC. From here you can alter a huge number of different things, from simple things like the RGB lighting and button mapping, to more detailed and specialised setups for your triggers and analogue sticks, altering deadzones and even the responsiveness of the internal gyro and rumble motors. It’s an impressive setup with one major caveat: at the moment there’s a known bug that can soft lock the controller if you attempt to update it – there’s a reset button on the back of the controller that undoes the lockout, and the whole process is something I don’t remember coming across elsewhere. However, everything else within the Connect software works as you’d expect, but it’s worth waiting to update your controller’s firmware until Gamesir have a fix in place for this.</p>
<p>Gamesir are making a mockery of the competition at the moment, and the Cyclone 2 readily beats out far more expensive controllers. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/thrustmaster-h-e-a-r-t-controller-review/">Thrustmaster’s HEART</a> controller has similarly great sticks, but everything else about it feels less premium than the Cyclone 2, and it’s wired-only. There’s more unusual offerings to consider though, like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/manba-one-gaming-controller-review/">Manba One</a> which features a screen on the controller itself, letting you customise it all without any other software, which is handy, and it has the same multiplatform connectivity at a similar price.</p>

			<p>Last Summer, Istanbul-based developer Motion Blur impressed gamers with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-is-an-impressive-looking-single-player-third-person-shooter-with-strong-metal-gear-solid-vibes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal</a> of Black State, an upcoming third-person shooter game that looked very reminiscent of the Metal Gear Solid series. Earlier this year, at CES 2025, the studio was on the showfloor at NVIDIA's booth to <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-looks-fantastic-in-this-4k-gameplay-from-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrate</a> that the excellent visuals was also coupled with incredible performance, even at this stage of development. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game is unique in that it does not utilize Lumen and Nanite as most games do. The gameplay mechanics are also intriguing, particularly with regards to the portal door mechanics that can seamlessly transition the main character from one location to another and back.</p>
<p>Following this latest showing, we contacted Motion Blur to learn more about Black State and the relatively unknown studio behind it. You can find the edited transcript of our lengthy chat with Studio Director Ömer Faruk Güngör below; we also got a couple of exclusive screenshots to accompany the text. By the way, the game is already available to wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3051160/Black_State/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black State - Gamescom 24' Tech Showcase B-roll" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YP62ceWl5Mc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Ömer, please start by telling us about yourself and your studio, Motion Blur. If I'm not mistaken, Black State is your first game.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, in 2006, our core team made the first international PC game in Turkey. I have a legendary copy. It's titled Nightmare 22 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabus_22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kabus 22</a> in Turkish). After that, yes, this is pretty much the first big AAA title for not just Motion Blur but also Turkey and the whole region.</p>
<p>As the studio director of Motion Blur. I'm pretty much dealing with all the development operations and also the business side of the operations. And also, I'm a writer. I wrote the story with Kadir Demirden. He is our CEO, founder, and head game designer of this game. He's the real deal.</p>
<p><strong>How big is Motion Blur in terms of employee count? Are you all working in the same office?</strong></p>
<p>We are 40 people in-house, and this is actually in our studio. This is my room, totally soundproof (sometimes I sleep here). Outside this room, we have a huge space for the rest of the people. We work in-house rather than remotely, because it would be a little bit harder to finish the game and do all this stuff. This is a strict rule, by the way; all of us should be here.</p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with the idea for Black State? It's pretty clear you were inspired by games like Metal Gear or Splinter Cell, but what was your own concept behind the game?</strong></p>
<p>It was our CEO's original idea. When we met him back in 2017, he had an idea for gameplay and a story, including the concept of these doors opening to different places. He had already completed his R&amp;D process.</p>
<p>So we started tailoring the gameplay and story and all the features, all the levels. Right now, we haven't released any trailers about the story or what is the main motivation for the main character, or what's going on in that universe. Why do these doors open to different places? Why is it that one of them is an art gallery and another is a ship? It has a meaning, actually. When you play the game, you realize that everything sticks together logically.</p>
<p>We hate it when developers say 'it's just a game', and dismiss any consistency issues. We hate that, so we worked meticulously on all these details and nuances about the IP itself, not just gameplay or the story, because we don't want the player to perceive any dissonances when they are playing. We don't want to undercut their motivation to play the game.</p>
<p>We have a 500-page design document that was completed before we even started the development phase. Every detail, every character, every gameplay feature, every gun, every line in the story, everything is in here. At Motion Blur, we are very strict about what we desire to do in this industry. It's not just that we had a cool idea and began making a game to see how it went.</p>
<p>No, we have a huge plan, not just for this project. The main objective for us is to make the best-looking games with the best optimization. When we showed Black State at CES, people were shocked when they saw it running at some 400 frames per second. For us, the game needs to run well because it's a game, not a movie.</p>
<p>Even before we started development, the core team knew the FPS target, the mesh counts, the limits we had, and everything from day zero. We can't make a game just for owners of high-end graphics cards. We are making games for all gamers. Of course, if you have better graphic cards, you can see better graphics and run it even faster, but if you have even an average GPU, Motion Blur still aims to give you a really fluid gaming experience. The whole idea, even the story itself, is built on this philosophy.</p>

We can't make a game just for owners of high-end graphics cards. We are making games for all gamers.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The game looks amazing, and it's surprising that it already runs so well. Usually, a game that looks this good, at this stage in development, is around 30 or 40 FPS. It's kind of unexpected, but more interestingly, I've read that you are not using the trademark features of Unreal Engine 5, Lumen, and Nanite. Is that correct?</strong></p>
<p>We have a dynamic lighting solution. So, sometimes we use it, but mainly, unlike everybody, we do not use Lumen and Nanite. As I said, we are making Black State for everyone. We are using Unreal Engine 5, but we made lots of customizations because of optimization to physics and other aspects of the engine. We altered them to make them more optimized and to make them fit our portal doors. I believe that it was at GDC 2022 when Epic's Unreal Engine engineers saw the portal mechanics for the first time, with the door opening, and suddenly, you're on another level, where you can go, and you can come back. They were shocked and asked how we managed something like this. Back then, we were maybe even fewer than 30 people. Right now, we are 40.</p>
<p>You have to change a lot of things and dive into the code, but&nbsp;I must admit, they have helped us a great deal. We are an indie game company, but they treat us like one of their friends. We ask them a lot of questions. Our team is directly in touch with their engineers. Thanks to the joint efforts of Epic and our team, right now, we don't have any problems with optimization.</p>
<p><strong>Since the game already performs so well, are you even going to need stuff like NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation? Will you implement it in Black State?</strong></p>
<p>We have a really close relationship with NVIDIA. They sent us the new GeForce RTX 50 GPUs a while ago so that we could start working on their new technologies. Let's put it this way: as the first step, we always imagine that you have the lowest hardware, and we're trying to optimize the game for you. And then, of course, we will add all these cool features.</p>
<p>From our perspective, optimization means that whatever you have, if we say you can play this game, whether you have DLSS and RTX or not, you should see and play a really good-looking game that performs well enough. We always consider the lowest denominator, but we are adding all these cool features if you have them.</p>
<p><strong>We've talked about PC so far, but I'm guessing you'd also like to launch the game on consoles eventually.</strong></p>
<p>This is a topic that we don't usually answer. Let's say that right now, we are focused only on PC, but of course, we want to give all gamers the best experience as much as possible on other platforms, as much, but right now, we are working on PC. Still, if you have something to play games with, eventually, we want to be there. But I can't say any timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Black State is hugely focused on those portal door mechanics. Tell us how it all works. I'm reading on the Steam page that these transitions lead to different adventures. What does that mean exactly?</strong></p>
<p>Without giving any spoilers, I can say that in the gameplay, the architects send you on a mission. We have a couple of different missions. When you are in a mission, you have to discover everything that you can to find those scientists that you have to save, and some other things that I can't say right now. But it means you have to look for them. But while you play the game and explore the map, some doors—and they're not just one or two; we have several—open to totally different places. We call them the other levels.</p>
<p>For example, in the b-roll we shared at CES 2025, of course we had cut it to avoid spoilers. But sometimes you are in a cellar, and one of the cellar doors opens to a subway. Then you have to discover and explore what's going on there and find out if it's the right path for you to find those guys or not.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you have to find something, and you start looking for the doors. Of course, the map can help you. But just imagine that in your mission, you'll never know whether you'll end up in a ship, art gallery, laboratory, or a manor. We have lots of more, but we haven't shown them, so I shouldn't tell them.</p>
<p>We hate that when you start playing a game in a manor or mansion, it usually means that at least 30 or 40% of the game takes place there. We want to give gamers diverse gameplay. You start in a manor and its door opens to a ship. Then you have to do lots of things on the ship, and maybe you have to come back and do another thing, and another door opens to an entirely different place. It's totally seamless. You can go and come back in every mission. Every big level includes lots of different doors like these where you can go and return.</p>
<p>You can also choose whether to go in this door first or that one instead. We don't want to force that much linear gameplay. Of course, Black State is still a single player linear game. It's not an open world, but you can sometimes choose which path to go. It's up to you.</p>

You can go and come back in every mission.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Since you mentioned that players have some kind of choice in picking which doors to open, are there any secondary objectives or side missions that are not explicitly related to the main mission?</strong></p>
<p>In our system, we have the main missions, but when you discover that mission, you'll start learning something and the architects start asking you about also finding that and discovering other stuff.</p>
<p>That little ball flying around with red light does two different things. One, it's scanning the area and making maps for you. That's why we call it mapmaker. But it can also scan and send some data to the architects. Depending on what you discover, they might need something else and tell you to find it and scan it for them.</p>
<p>It's not like, 'find us ten different flowers and send us the pictures'. It's not something like that; it's totally related to the main mission and the story. We don't have any time-consuming side gigs that are unrelated to what's going on. We have lots of different objectives, but they're&nbsp;always related to the main story and mission.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any character progression system in Black State where players might unlock new skills or new abilities and items?</strong></p>
<p>I believe I shouldn't answer this right now. Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>Fair enough! But, you know, the Steam page does say there are several weapons and gadgets and stuff like that.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, you'll have different gadgets and weapons. You haven't seen all of them. There's a balance in the gameplay. Of&nbsp;course, you won't get them all in the first mission.</p>
<p><strong>Can you go through a level of Black State entirely with stealth, without being discovered, or does the gameplay kind of force you to fight with weapons in some instances?</strong></p>
<p>Kadir Demirden, our head game designer and CEO, hates that. He hates forcing gamers to be stealthy on this level or to kill everybody on this other level.</p>
<p>That's why we have to implement game design to allow gamers both possibilities on every level. It's actually killing us. It's a little bit hard, but we believe that's what gamers want and need because, in time, we discovered that everyone plays totally differently.</p>
<p>If you want to go stealthy, then you should be rewarded from the game, or if you want to kill everybody, okay, there is no limit that you can't do that. That's actually why we have 110 unique takedowns, and we are adding more. It's because the animations vary if you are in stealth, if you are in cover, low or high, or the enemy is behind it or next to you or forward to you. We have totally different killing animations for all these.</p>
<p>It's killing us because most of the time it's me and my team, the animation team, doing all these motion captures. When you kill somebody, it means you killed some of us from the team.</p>

<p><strong>So, you have a motion capture setup in the studio.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are basically doing all this motion capture and stunt stuff. Sometimes we work with real MMA fighters, professional fighters in Turkey. We don't have any stuntmen here, so Kadir's idea was to find real fighters, let them fight, and record it with motion capture equipment. Then, of course, we had to clean and polish all the animations. Right now we have 110 different ones, but we probably recorded 500 or 600 different killing animations with them. We only chose the best ones.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned boss fights...</strong></p>
<p>Please don't ask how many of them we have!</p>
<p><strong>Alright, I won't. Even though the thought had crossed my mind. I guess I'll ask how prevalent they are in Black State. Are we going to be mostly fighting regular enemies and then, every once in a while, a boss, or are they more prevalent throughout the game?</strong></p>
<p>We have bosses, and all of them are totally related to the story. Before you fight them, you learn a lot about them. So far, we have only shown one of them, and people already started thinking and saying that they'd always be like that one.&nbsp;Actually, every boss fight will be completely different, with unique patterns and styles.</p>
<p>I don't want to spoil anything that I shouldn't, but you'll see the other ones are very different from what we have shown. I mean, we are not a boss fight game. We don't have too many, but we have more than enough for a game like ours.</p>
<p><strong>Are there going to be a lot of story cutscenes? Everyone has been comparing the game to Metal Gear, and Metal Gear is known to be very heavy on the cut scenes, mainly because of Kojiima.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we love Kojima. Kadir always says he is the biggest reason we make games, and we're really thankful for that. Of course, it was a huge honor when IGN said after the first announcement trailer that our game looked like something from the Metal Gear Solid series. But the gameplay style of Black State and MGS is not the same. If people expect MGS from it, they'll find out it's not.</p>
<p>In regard to your question, yes, we have cut scenes, but of course, not as much as Kojima's series. But we always try to only take control away from the gamer if it's really important and anyway not longer than what's required to tell an important part of the story.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we also have in-game lines where you talk with somebody while you are playing because this is a game. The most important thing is that they should play, not just wait and see our story. Of course, as a story writer, I would love to make longer stories, but Black State is a game, so we shouldn't overstep. We should tell them the story in playable scenes as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there going to be several difficulty settings that the user can pick to tailor their experience?</strong></p>
<p>This is also something I shouldn't talk about yet. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share at what stage of the development your team is right now?</strong></p>
<p>We are still in Alpha. Here's a funny thing: someone from the game industry, an executive, asked me years ago what Alpha means. I told them, it's when you have put everything together, but everywhere is on fire.</p>

But we always try to only take control away from the gamer if it's really important and anyway not longer than what's required to tell an important part of the story.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>When can we expect to see more about Black State?</strong></p>
<p>We have marketing beats waiting for us. The most important thing for us is that we&nbsp;want to prove that this is an optimized game. Because, like you said, when you see something like this, you probably start thinking, my computer can't run it; I&nbsp;won't be able to play.</p>
<p>We also want to share a bit about the story. We only started to show the game last Summer, so we have more and more marketing beats. We believe that we can show what exactly this game is about. There will be more videos about the game and specifically about the gameplay and story, but I can't say any details about the timing right now.</p>
<p><strong>Will we learn more about the protagonist in these upcoming marketing beats, or are you keeping the mystery until the actual game release? Right now, we don't even know his name.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, one of these beats is definitely related to the story. We want to tell gamers what this is all about, what these doors are, who this guy is, and who the architects are. All of that without ruining the full plot, but we want to give them the idea, 'it's probably about something like this or that'. We can't hide something like this until lunch. This isn't a game like you've seen before, so you have to learn something about what you're going to play if you want to play.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about subscription services such as GamePass? Is that something you might be interested in for Black State if you received an offer?</strong></p>
<p>We have close relationships with all the companies like Sony, Xbox, and the others. They have a lot of different platforms and options for gamers. I believe that gamers love those kind of things, but right now we are just focusing on the development side. Still, if the offer fits the direction that we desire to go, then it might be considered, but it's too early to definitively comment on it.</p>
<p>The most important thing for our company when we are considering all these options is to understand what gamers want from us. Our motto is that we don't care about what the big companies think, the numbers, or trends. We only want to gain the gamers' hearts. If they want to see more takedowns in the game, we'll add them. If they want this platform or that platform, if they want diverse gameplay, if they want more gunplay, we want to give them that because they will buy the game and we should give them the best experience.</p>
<p>That's the most important thing when we are choosing platforms or making business decisions. We cannot compromise on this. Then we can talk about the rest of the details.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Every few months we see a bunch of upcoming games come and take to the walkway to strut their stuff and showcase what might be releasing in the next few months, this time in the&nbsp;Steam Next Fest for&nbsp;Winter 2025. What started as a COVID-era replacement of opportunity for events like PAX has become a consistent discovery point for many developers, with Next Fests now reliably having over 1,000 games in them.</p>

<p>No one could try them all, but with some time to play a number, and my own feelings on games, I can tell you 10 Steam Next Fest Demos you should get out and try, or at least keep your eyes on these games if they sound at all interesting to you.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3445320/Tower_of_Babel_Survivors_of_Chaos_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tower of Babel Survivors of Chaos">Tower of Babel: Survivors of Chaos</a></em></h2>



<p>Take the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vampire Survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> </em>Bullet Heaven formula, toss it in a blender with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Diablo 2"><em>Diablo 2</em></a>, and after a few checks you may find that you come out with <em>Tower of Babel: Survivors of Chaos</em>. Beyond the equipment being very <em>Diablo-</em>esque, you’ll also notice that many of the abilities seem like they came right out of <em>Diablo 2</em>. Hammer of Might made me think of Hammerdins,&nbsp;while Ice Orbs felt like my favorite<i> </i>build, a Glacial Orb Sorceress.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2911500/Yes_Your_Grace_Snowfall_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Yes, Your Grace: Snowfall">Yes, Your Grace: Snowfall</a></em></h2>



<p>The sequel to the exquisite <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yes-your-grace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Yes, Your Grace"><em>Yes, Your Grace</em></a> in 2020, <em>Yes, Your Grace: Snowfall</em> brings takes it to the next level with the same focus on narrative and strategic choices to be made, while adding new wrinkles and levels of options in what you can do. You can play this without having played the first, but you’ll have the story of the first game revealed as it sets up what the world state is at the start of <em>Yes, Your Grace: Snowfall</em>.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3475100/Void_War_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Void War ">Void War</a></em></h2>



<p>What if <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/ftl-advanced-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" FTL Advanced Edition Review">FTL</a></em> was built around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Warhammer 40k"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>&nbsp;license? Well, if they failed to get the negotiations over and had to slightly scrub off references, you’d end up with <em>Void War</em>. It adds a few wrinkles to the <em>FTL </em>formula, but it is very similar&nbsp;and features similarly snappy play and roguelite decision making.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Promise Mascot Agency ">Promise Mascot Agency</a></em></h2>



<p>From the creators of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paradise-killer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Paradise Killer">Paradise Killer</a> </em>comes a really out-there game – a world where mascots have abilities and are real beings in the same world with us.</p>

<p>You play as a disgraced Yakuza member (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-gaiden-man-who-erased-his-name-review-yakuza-greatest-hits" rel="nofollow">voiced by none other than the voice of Kazuma Kiryu himself</a>) in a run-down cursed Japanese town having to rebuild a failed mascot agency by recruiting quirky and abandoned mascots and doing a variety of jobs around town. Expect to be driving a lot and doing silly things all over while the cast takes it deadly serious in a wonderfully campy and fun video game.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3448280/Gothic_1_Remake__Demo_Nyras_Prologue/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gothic 1 Remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a></em></h2>



<p>The <em>Gothic 1 Remake </em>captures the classic <em>Gothic </em>feel in the prequel demo with that beginning of powerlessness in an open world that the Gothic series was known for in its heyday. You can feel yourself improving as you learn things, and the game looks beautiful.</p>

<p>There's some jank to be worked out for sure, but so far it looks like a worthy revival of a storied RPG franchise. Just give it some patience, and be willing to meet it part way as its world operates on a different sense than most modern open-world RPGs<em>,</em> and when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-2025-release-window" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Gothic 1 Remake Will Launch in 2025, Developer Says"><em>Gothic 1 Remake</em> releases</a> later this year you'll have a good time.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3218530/Best_Served_Cold/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Best Served Cold">Best Served Cold</a></em></h2>



<p>If you played one of 2016’s best games,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/va-11-hall" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" VA-11 HALL-A"><em>VA-11 Hall-A</em></a>, you might have been looking for other games in that vein ever since. The newest contender on the block is <em>Best Served Cold</em>, which ditches the dystopic cyberpunk bar for a 1920s-era speakeasy, and adds in a murder mystery. Some strong storytelling and setup here make this a game I want to see more of when it comes out.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3482820/Crystal_Rail_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crystal Rail">Crystal Rail</a></em></h2>



<p><em>Crystal Rail</em> is an innovative digital board game that also takes inspiration from roguelites. It brings to mind strategy games and trading games, both digitally and tabletop. It particularly brings to mind <em>Gazillionaire </em>for me, and the times playing that with my family in my younger days (back when games had play-by-email options).</p>

<p>My only complaint after playing it really is that it doesn't seem likely to have multiplayer in the future, so I can't plan to play it together with friends.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112480/Drop_Duchy_Demo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Drop Duchy Demo">Drop Duchy</a></em></h2>



<p><em>Drop Duchy </em>is an interesting play on the <em>Tetris</em>-styled puzzle formula by turning the blocks into pieces of a roguelite building game, and you arrange them to gather resources and/or build an army to take on opposition. It plays slickly, intelligently, and has that addictive one-more-try type feel that many of the best roguelites have.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Solasta 2">Solasta 2</a></em></h2>



<p><em>Solasta 2 </em>looks and plays great as an adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dungeons and Dragons">5th edition <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>&nbsp;that aims to add more story and character to the series, building on what <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/solasta-crown-of-magister-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Solasta: Crown of the Magister Review"><em>Solasta: Crown of the Magister</em></a> laid down. While it doesn't quite have all the bells and whistles of<em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Baldur's Gate 3">Baldur's Gate 3</a></em>, it is a lot of fun and it feels like playing a published campaign in many ways.</p>

<p>One small grace note for those looking to learn 5e from the video game is that they note when something is a house rule adaptation done to help bridge the gap between tabletop and digital roleplaying, so you'll know when a certain mechanic isn't quite the same as on tabletop.</p>

<h2><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Monster Train 2">Monster Train 2</a></em></h2>



<p>Did you enjoy <em>Monster Train</em>? Do you enjoy roguelite deckbuilders? If you answered yes to either, you should go and play the recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Monster Train 2 Brings More Deckbuilding Madness, Demo Available Now">announced <em>Monster Train 2</em></a><i>&nbsp;</i>demo right after reading this article, as it is more <em>Monster Train</em>. An iterative, rather than innovative, sequel, it builds upon the first game by offering more of the same with new content and a few twists.</p>

<hr><p>That’s 10 games for you to try this weekend, among the many other games that are out there for the Winter Steam Next Fest 2025. If you’ve tried one and want to recommend it, let us know!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Hits 1.2m Steam Players at Launch, Breaking Capcom Records]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-1-2m-steam-players-at-launch-breaking-capcom-records.1121802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has debuted to record Steam player numbers, shattering previous records for both the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise and Capcom as a whole on the platform.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2246340/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, the game currently has 1,267,944 concurrent players, and that number is rapidly climbing, too. I wouldn't be surprised if <i>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</i>broke the 1.5 million mark later in the day, when people start coming home from work, school, and their various other obligations.</p>

<p>It probably goes without saying that this represents an absolutely colossal leap up from&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>'s previous Steam record, which was achieved by&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>'s 334,684 peak player count back in 2018. (Incidentally,&nbsp;<em>World&nbsp;</em>still has 34,745 players on Steam at time of writing.)</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-count-1.2m-flying.jpg?itok=8O_-eGPm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-count-1.2m-flying.jpg?itok=YWpKHTJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has hit an impressive Steam player count on the day of its launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we're not counting the players who flocked to the first&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held back in November</a> and which also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">achieved a higher peak player count</a> than&nbsp;<em>World&nbsp;</em>did. Still, that was essentially a demo, and this is the real thing.</p>

<p>Not only has&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>broken records for its franchise on Steam, but it's also shattered previous records for Capcom as a whole. The game has shot to the top of Capcom's <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/CAPCOM+Co.%2C+Ltd./" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam charts</a>, beating out both&nbsp;<em>Capcom Arcade Stadium&nbsp;</em>compilations, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>

<p>Capcom's new game is now the seventh most-played game <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=peak" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of all time</a> on Steam; it's still got a ways to go to catch up with games like&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, and&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>, but I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see it scale those lofty heights over the weekend.</p>

<p>With that said,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>might have&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em>beat for now, but developer Pocketpair knew how successful the game would be; yesterday, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">announced it would give its staff the day off today</a> because it anticipated a lot of employees calling in sick (almost certainly to play&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>).</p>




<p>It's worth noting that this Steam number naturally doesn't take into account console players. I really wouldn't be surprised if&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>turns out to have sold two or three million copies on launch day alone.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9p7pd6wp5ghx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Given his storied track record, the film featuring Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Emily Blunt, and Leonardo DiCaprio will undoubtedly make at least one of the characters those stars are playing, if not all of them, a charismatically terrible person. That’s because few directors have made us fall in love with lawbreakers like the Oscar-winning director that’s entertained audiences for nearly 60 years.</p><p>DiCaprio is no stranger to this, appearing in Scorsese films as a degenerate Wall Street trader (<em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>), a sleazy double agent (<em>The Departed</em>), and a mentally ill criminal who thinks he’s a detective trying to get justice (<em>Shutter Island</em>). What on Earth will Scorsese do with the rest of the cast? Will The Rock be a paranoid schizophrenic stalker like Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) in <em>Taxi Driver</em>? Or will Emily Blunt charm men out of their boxers while she robs them blind like Bertha Thompson (Barbara Hershey) in <em>Boxcar Bertha</em>? Whatever the case, this is a great time to look back at the most charismatic criminals from Scorsese’s best films. </p></div></div><div><p>Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) doesn’t walk into a room—he invades it, his presence as sharp as the cleaver on his belt. He doesn’t just dominate the world of <em>Gangs of New York</em>—he owns it, bending it to his will with a mix of brutal violence and theatrical flair. And similarly, Daniel Day-Lewis doesn’t just play Bill; he embodies him, swaggering through the Five Points like a king surveying his kingdom, every word dripping with menace and poetry. His speech about the “nature of the wound” is chillingly poetic, revealing him as a man who sees himself as a sculptor of history, shaping New York with blood and steel. The way he taunts Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) at the dinner table, hammering a knife into his own eye socket without flinching, is pure, terrifying showmanship—a performance within a performance. Bill is terrifying not just because he’s a butcher by trade, but because he makes violence feel like destiny. He commands respect not through fear alone, but through presence, through sheer force of personality, making even his most monstrous acts feel like law.</p></div><div><p>Bertha Thompson (Barbara Hershey) is one of Scorsese’s most charismatic criminals because she turns rebellion into an art form—she’s not just running from the law, she’s dancing through it. Hershey plays her with a devil-may-care charm, flashing a wide, defiant grin even as she drifts from con to con, from lover to lover, from train car to train car. Unlike the cold calculation of <em>Casino</em>’s Ace Rothstein or the ruthless ambition of <em>Goodfellas</em>’ Henry Hill, Bertha’s charisma isn’t built on control—it’s built on freedom. She seduces men with the same effortless ease with which she robs them, and when she pulls off a heist, it’s not about power, but play. Even when the stakes get deadly, like when she and her crew ambush a railway boss, there’s a magnetic recklessness to her—she believes in the cause but loves the chaos. And that’s what makes her unforgettable—she’s not just a criminal, she’s an outlaw in the purest sense, laughing in the face of a world that tells her to stay in her place.</p></div><div><p>Andrew Laeddis is one of Scorsese’s most charismatic criminals because he doesn’t act like one—he sells himself as the hero of his own story, and DiCaprio makes us believe him. Unlike the swaggering mobsters of <em>Goodfellas</em> or <em>Casino</em>, who revel in their power, or the scheming hustlers of <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>, who charm their way to fortune, Laeddis’s charisma is built on conviction, not confidence. He strides through <em>Shutter Island</em> with the intensity of a detective chasing justice, his voice clipped, his stare unwavering, his every move calculated to prove he’s in control. But the brilliance of his character—what makes him more magnetic than Scorsese’s gangsters and grifters—is that it’s all a performance, even to himself. The way he commands a room, challenges authority, and pieces together clues isn’t just gripping—it’s heartbreaking, because by the time the illusion shatters, we realize his greatest trick wasn’t fooling others, but convincing himself he was never a criminal at all.</p></div><div><p>Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) walks into the bar of Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) with a quiet, coiled energy, eyes scanning the room like he’s five moves ahead. He’s a man who can throw down in a bar fight one second and crack under the weight of his double life the next. DiCaprio gives him an electric unpredictability—whether it’s smashing a guy’s head with a glass to prove his worth or staring Costello down with barely concealed disgust, Billy is always teetering on the edge. Unlike the slick operators in Scorsese’s world, he’s not playing for power or money—he’s drowning in a role that’s eating him alive, and that raw desperation makes him the most tragic, yet captivating, criminal in Scorsese’s canon.</p></div><div><p>The first time we see Vincent Lauria (Tom Cruise) in <em>The Color of Money</em>, he’s grinning ear to ear, twirling his cue like a sword, and making impossible shots look easy—he’s got it all, and he knows it. No Scorsese criminal has been as effortlessly slick and frustratingly cocky, a pool hustler with Cruise’s megawatt charm and a dangerous addiction to showing off. Whether it’s humiliating seasoned players in Atlantic City or strutting around like a rock star, Vincent makes hustling look like performance art. But that same ego gets him hustled himself, blinds him to the lessons of old hat Eddie (Paul Newman), and nearly tanks his shot at true greatness. Scorsese doesn’t just make us admire Vincent—he makes us watch in frustration as his charisma and arrogance collide, proving that in his world, unchecked confidence is always the first step toward downfall.</p></div><div><p>Few cinematic criminals exude meticulous brilliance and effortless charm quite like Sam “Ace” Rothstein in <em>Casino</em>. Conveyed with clinical precision by Robert De Niro, Ace is not the kind of gangster who thrives on brute force or impulsive violence; instead, he is a meticulous strategist, a man whose power lies in his uncanny ability to read people and numbers<strong> </strong>alike. From the moment he steps into the Tangiers Casino, he commands absolute authority—not through fear, but through an almost hypnotic charisma. His early narration, detailing how he runs the casino floor with the efficiency of a Swiss watch, is as mesmerizing as it is insightful, revealing a man who treats gambling less as a vice and more as a science. Scenes like the one where he spots a dealer shuffling imperfectly and immediately fires him illustrate his near-superhuman attention to detail, making his presence feel omnipotent without him ever needing to raise his voice.</p><p>Yet despite his extraordinary competence, Ace’s charisma ultimately proves to be both his weapon and his Achilles’ heel. His ability to command respect unravels in the face of personal entanglements, particularly with the mercurial Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) and the reckless Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci). His icy composure cracks in spectacular fashion when he pleads with Ginger in the restaurant scene, his desperation contrasting starkly with the unwavering control he exerts in the casino. Similarly, his growing paranoia—exemplified in the scene where he dons oversized pink-lensed glasses and wages a personal war against corrupt gaming regulators—signals the beginning of his downfall. In the end, Scorsese constructs Ace as a figure who redefines the archetype of the cinematic gangster, proving that in a world of unchecked ambition, even the most composed tactician can become a victim of his own allure.</p></div><div><p>Travis Bickle (Robert DeNiro) in <em>Taxi Driver</em> isn’t just an outsider—he’s a ticking time bomb wrapped in quiet, awkward charm. At first, he blends into the background of New York’s sleepless underworld, a loner who navigates the neon-lit streets with an almost ghostly presence. But beneath his detached exterior is an energy that draws people in, whether it’s his strangely endearing nervousness while asking Betsy out for coffee or his hypnotic conviction as he monologues about cleaning up the city’s filth. Even in his most unnerving moments—like the legendary one of him staring into a mirror, pulling an imaginary gun, and asking, “You talkin’ to me?”—there’s something undeniably magnetic about him. He doesn’t just play at being dangerous; he carries the weight of someone who genuinely believes he’s been chosen for a righteous mission.</p><p>Ultimately, it’s Travis’s warped sense of heroism that both elevates and dooms him. He transforms himself into a vigilante with a feverish devotion, shaving his head into a menacing mohawk and marching, gun in hand, toward a bloodbath he sees as salvation. The climax—his brutal, chaotic shootout to “rescue” Iris—cements him as an urban legend, a criminal who is mistaken for a martyr. Scorsese frames him not as a traditional villain but as a man so convinced of his own purpose that reality bends around him. He isn’t larger than life like Costello or Henry Hill; he’s something eerier—a man who thrives in the shadows, fueled by isolation, yet unable to resist the pull of infamy.</p></div><div><p>Robert De Niro’s Jake LaMotta in <em>Raging Bull</em> isn’t just a boxer—he’s a criminal in spirit, a man whose violence and paranoia make him as dangerous outside the ring as he is inside it. His world is built on domination, whether he’s throwing fights for the Mafia or terrorizing his own family with accusations and fists. His arrogance makes him believe he can outmaneuver the mob, yet he humiliates himself by taking a dive on their orders, absorbing each punch like a man who knows he’s already lost. But his worst crimes are personal—his jealous rages turn him against his wife and brother, his fists becoming weapons of control, not just competition. In a world where survival is about power, LaMotta’s downfall isn’t orchestrated by the Mafia but by his own inability to stop fighting, even when there’s no one left to hit but himself.</p><p>His self-destruction becomes literal when he is arrested for allowing an underage girl into his nightclub, his reckless arrogance catching up to him at last. By the time he sits in a jail cell, pounding his fists against the walls, sobbing “I’m not an animal!” the transformation is complete—he has become his own worst enemy, caged by the very violence that once made him great. Unlike the gangsters of <em>Goodfellas</em> or <em>Casino</em>, LaMotta’s crimes aren’t about power or greed but about a man who only knows how to destroy. Scorsese doesn’t just show his downfall; he shows a man who never knew how to stop swinging, even when the fight was long over.</p></div><div><p>Portrayed with gleeful menace by Jack Nicholson, Frank Costello in <em>The Departed</em> isn’t just a mob boss—he’s an almost mythical figure who moves through Boston’s underworld like a god who relishes in his own chaos. Right from his ominous opening monologue where he snarls, “I don’t want to be a product of my environment, I want my environment to be a product of me,” Costello asserts himself as the ultimate manipulator with the charm to make anyone believe him. He doesn’t just demand respect—he seduces loyalty and corrupts innocence with the charm of a devil wearing a velvet glove. </p><p>Eventually, the very untouchability that made Costello feel larger than life becomes the thing that seals his fate. He is so convinced of his own power that he underestimates the very machine he helped build, never once believing that Sullivan, his own hand-groomed mole, might turn on him. His brash arrogance peaks when he finally confronts Sullivan in a darkened warehouse, grinning like a lunatic as he cryptically asks, <em>“Do you think they’d give you up?”</em>—as if daring the inevitable. But the old-school gangster is already outdated, his unchecked reign of terror no match for a world where survival demands subtlety. He dies as theatrically as he lived, gunned down in a brutal execution, spitting blood and insults to the bitter end. Scorsese paints him as a man who thrived on dominance and manipulation, but like every titan of crime, he inevitably flew too close to the sun, mistaking fear for invincibility.</p></div><div><p>From the moment Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill breaks the fourth wall and delivers the iconic line, “As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster,” Scorsese lets us know we’re in for a ride with a character as magnetic as he is morally bankrupt. Whether he’s taking his future wife Karen (Lorraine Bracco) on an effortless, one-shot stroll through the Copacabana kitchen entrance or flashing that manic, cocaine-fueled grin while juggling side hustles, Henry radiates the kind of effortless cool that makes his lifestyle look intoxicatingly irresistible. Even his darkest acts—like laughing off a man getting shot in a bar by Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) or using his charm to deflect Karen’s growing suspicions—are laced with an undeniable charisma. Liotta brings a kinetic, boyish energy to Henry, making him both an aspirational and tragic figure, a guy who seems too slick to fail until, inevitably, he does.</p><p>And like all Scorsese antiheroes, the very qualities that made Henry larger than life are what send him crashing down. That confidence curdles into paranoia as he spirals into drug addiction, sweating through a single day of frantic coke deals while dodging the FBI helicopter that stalks him from above. His casual betrayal of his closest friends to save himself in the courtroom is less a grand Shakespearean downfall and more a pathetic whimper—Henry, once the smooth-talking wiseguy with the world at his fingertips, reduced to a schlubby suburban nobody forced to live like a “schnook.” Unlike Jordan Belfort, who lands on his feet with a new scam to run, Henry’s fate is less poetic and more tragic: a man who had it all, lost it all, and can never get it back. Scorsese doesn’t just tell us how alluring crime can be—he shows us, and then he shows us why it never lasts.</p></div><div><p>No Scorsese criminal has been simultaneously as irresistibly charismatic and as undeniably problematic as degenerate playboy and Wall Street trader Jordan Belfort in <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>. Besides casting Leonardo DiCaprio, one of the most charismatic movie stars of all time, to play Belfort, Scorsese seems dead set on making his criminal exploits as reprehensible and thrilling as possible. We all know driving under the influence is reckless and can kill innocent people. That didn’t stop any of us from nearly projectile vomiting from laughter watching Belfort crawl to his car to drive home under the influence of 15-year-old Quaaludes. There’s Belfort’s famous “I’m not leaving” speech that could hype up a corpse, Belfort casually explaining how his firm committed market manipulation through backdoor IPO deals, and of course, there’s Belfort’s sales psychology lesson on display in getting someone to sell him a pen. </p><p>Eventually, the same arrogance and charisma that Scorsese inundates us with is what begets Belfort’s fall. His feeling of being untouchable leads him to disregard FBI investigations which leads to him taking incriminating phone calls which leads to his arrest. He nearly dies when his yacht capsizes after he wanted to ride in a storm in order to smuggle money out of Switzerland. The man who was worshipped as a god by employees like Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill) eventually turned on those people to save himself. In the end, Scorsese paints a cautionary tale of how charisma and criminality only mix for so long before the former makes the latter a kind of death sentence. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-16-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 release date, with the latest update for the stylish hack-and-slash action RPG set to launch next month.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">January's Version 1.5</a>,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6, which bears the characteristically HoYoverse alternate title of "Among the Forgotten Ruins", will launch across all platforms on March 12th.</p>

<p>It'll bring with it a new chapter of the main story in which you must go up against the mysterious phantom thief syndicate known as Mockingbird, attempting to secure an artifact replete with secrets. Sounds like classic&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>stuff to me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.6-soldier-0-anby.jpg?itok=yw5J5rMM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.6-soldier-0-anby.jpg?itok=oj4oOjs9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 brings new Agents and more in March.</figcaption></figure><p>As is usually the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a> for HoYoverse's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-31-release-date" rel="nofollow">games</a>,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 will also bring three new Agents with it. The first, Soldier 0 - Anby, is an S-rank Electric Attack Agent who can amplify crit damage for her allies.</p>

<p>Another S-rank Agent, Trigger, will also be joining the fray in this update. Like Soldier 0 - Anby, Trigger's element is Electric, but she's a Stun Agent who can easily dodge attacks using her Sniper Mode and boost damage from her teammates.</p>

<p>Lastly, Pulchra will be available as an A-rank Physical Stun Agent in Version 1.6, and reruns will be available for Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan throughout the update's life cycle.</p>

<p>As well as all of the above, you'll also get the chance to fight a new boss, Geppetto, in Hollow Zero, and there are plenty of other new challenges to try out as well.&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.6 is a characteristically dense HoYoverse update, so make sure to add March 12th to your calendar if you're a fan.</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest game to be released by&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-developer-mihoyo-rebrands-as-hoyoverse" rel="nofollow">formerly known as miHoYo</a>).</p>

<p>Like its predecessors,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is an action RPG, but its emphasis is far more on stylish hack-and-slash combat rather than the elemental experimentation of&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>or the turn-based strategizing of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/official-amd-radeon-rx-9070-and-9070-xt-start-at-549-ship-march-6th.1121766/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/621339/amd-radeon-9070-xt-price-release-date-gpu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>AMD’s answer to Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs is arriving next week — and its new graphics cards are aggressively priced against Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/615075/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-review-test-benchmark">$749 GeForce RTX 5070 Ti</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">$549 RTX 5070</a>. The AMD Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT ship on March 6th for $549 and $599, respectively, one day after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/612650/nvidia-delays-rtx-5070-after-amd-9070">the RTX 5070 arrives</a>.</p><p>AMD says they both offer “4K gaming at a 1440p price,” though it’s making some unusual comparisons to do so — according to AMD, the 9070 XT is 51 percent faster on average than a four-year-old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163537/amd-radeon-rx-6900-xt-review-roundup">RX 6900 XT</a> at 4K and max settings and 26 percent faster than a four-year-old RTX 3090 at the same settings, cards that filled a pricey niche two generations ago.</p><p>While leaks had suggested the pricing of AMD’s 9070 could start at $649, <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1238/amd-unveils-next-generation-amd-rdna-4-architecture-with">AMD surprised everyone today</a> with suggested retail prices at $549 for this card — putting it head-to-head with Nvidia’s $549 RTX 5070. The $599 9700 XT could even challenge Nvidia’s $749 pricing for its RTX 5070 Ti, as long as AMD has managed to deliver performance that can challenge both of these RTX 50-series cards.</p><p>We won’t know the full answer to that until reviews for AMD’s cards appear next week as well as reviews for Nvidia’s RTX 5070. AMD is dropping some performance hints about where its 9070 series cards might fit in, though. AMD says the 9070 XT is 42 percent more potent at 4K Ultra (and 38 percent at 1440p Ultra) than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24083386/amd-radeon-rx-7900-gre-review-benchmarks-price">AMD’s RX 7900 GRE</a>, a card that challenged the RTX 4070 at $549 but vanished after less than a year. And it’s “just barely slightly slower” than a 7900 XTX, AMD’s 2022 flagship, we heard on a call.</p><p>The vanilla RX 9070, meanwhile, is 21 percent faster than the same 7900 GRE at 4K, suggesting it’s not far off the XT in performance: 38 percent faster than the AMD 6800 XT and 26 percent faster than the Nvidia RTX 3080, according to AMD. At 220 watts of board power, AMD’s director of graphics product management, Scott Olschewsky, says the 4nm monolithic chip is “the most efficient GPU we’ve ever built.”</p><p>Each card also offers 16GB of GDDR6 memory, DisplayPort 2.1a and HDMI 2.1b ports, and are PCIe 5.0 cards — not that your motherboard needs a 5.0 new slot or would necessarily benefit from one. They will use standard 8-pin PCIe power connectors.</p><p>While both the 9070 and 9070 XT have far fewer graphics compute units than the 7900 GRE (55, 64, and 80, respectively), they don’t need as many because they’re the first cards to ship with RDNA 4, which AMD says offers twice the rasterization (read: non-ray traced) graphics performance per compute unit as RDNA 2. (RDNA 3 was closer to 1.4x that of RDNA 2.)</p><p>AMD says it’s taken larger steps than that in ray tracing, too, and almost fully doubled its FP16 machine learning performance since RDNA 3, and up to 779 TOPS, though performance will differ from app to app: AMD’s only seeing 12 percent more performance in Adobe Lightroom super resolution over the 7900 GRE, as one example.</p><p>But even if you’re not playing with AI very intentionally, AMD will put that hardware to use in gaming with FSR 4, which comes with a new AI upscaling algorithm for its super resolution tech that’ll exclusively run on these RDNA 4 and newer cards.</p><p>Olschewsky says FSR 4 can increase frame rates “while looking just as good as native rendering” at 4K resolution. AMD used some images from <em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em> — a title that averages just 53fps at 4K Ultra settings — to show more fine detail in the distant background of an image while averaging at 182fps with FSR 4 and frame generation turned on.</p><p>And while AMD didn’t share expected performance for that game without the fake frames added, it did break out the differences for a handful of other games like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>:</p><p>AMD says it’ll have 30 FSR4 games at launch and over 75 by the end of the year — one obvious theme is a <em>lot</em> of PS5 games, making us wonder how closely the PS5 Pro’s “PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution,” an AI upscaler powered by AMD hardware, might be related to it. But AMD also says FSR 3.1 games can be updated to FSR 4 “with a simple toggle.”</p><p>The new cards also have an enhanced media engine with higher image quality for gameplay recording, as the last one “did not meet quality expectations from the gamers trying to record and stream.” AMD says its Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF), its generic fake frame generation you can apply to any game yourself, is being upgraded to AFMF 2.1, with less ghosting and smearing of details.</p><p>As with any graphics card these days, the actual amount you pay will be determined by whether AMD can actually make enough of the things, and if AMD’s board partners don’t jack up the price. Olschewsky had some fighting words for Nvidia there, though: “We believe that our 9070 XT will be going toe-to-toe with what you’ve seen from the 5070 Ti that users may or may not be able to buy,” adding that the 9070 “is going to look very strong against their upcoming 5070.”</p><p>Unlike Nvidia, which warned of shortages with its new cards, he says AMD expects “strong availability at launch.”</p><p>“We are working with all of our partners to go and deliver the most competitive prices on GPUs around the world; our focus is ensuring cards hit target price points around the world. It’s difficult to predict what’s going to happen, but we’ll be working with partners as we see pricing show up.”</p><p>At the end of AMD’s event today the company also teased that its RX 9060 series cards will arrive in the second quarter to “broaden the family even further.” AMD plans to disclose more information about these cards “later,” but it certainly looks like it’s getting ready to challenge Nvidia’s unannounced RTX 5060 cards.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s a hefty investment, but it’s worth it for an Arquebus user looking for improved crowd control, survivability, and high damage output, so don’t be a cheapass!</p><p>Kampeki also sells a solid pistol called Fair Play, though I wouldn’t go so far as to call it the best the game has to offer. And don’t forget to buy some lockpicks from her (and every merchant you come across) so you can open loot chests and doors!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has released an all-new update in Escape from Tarkov. The core of this update is that it <strong>finally </strong>gets rid of snowy weather and brings back a spring atmosphere. It’s that time of year when the ice underfoot has thawed and the trees are in bloom, which is great news for anyone tired of snowblindness or crunchy footsteps.</p>



<p>The team at BSG has also made several major updates to the game’s AI engine and mechanics, which have been an instant hit with players worldwide.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about this relatively major Escape from Tarkov update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-springtime-has-arrived">Springtime Has Arrived</h2>



<p>Now that the world is no longer white in Escape from Tarkov, you can hide in bushes and wear dark clothing once again. The removal of snow and the arrival of spring weather is great, even if it means it’ll be raining a little more in your raids.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov fans around the world are rejoicing at some of the newest AI-based changes in the game, though.</p>



<p>For this popular extraction shooter, the AI intelligence, mechanics, and tactics are all sticking points that can often mess with the community to no end. We’ve seen ‘aimbot’ enemies, bizarre health pool changes, dimwitted patrol paths, and audio issues all tied to AI NPCs over the years.</p>



<p>This latest Tarkov patch makes a <strong>phenomenal number </strong>of changes to the game’s AI.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enemy detection has been overhauled and is dependent on distance, view angle, weather, stance, and aggravation levels. If you’re prone in fog and not in the enemy’s line of sight, you’ll be detected incredibly slowly compared to if you were running in the open</li>



<li>Vegetation now impacts the enemy’s vision – except Zryachiy, Birdeye, and the BTR because they’re just on another level. If you hide in a bush, <strong>you’re hidden</strong>.</li>



<li>Enemies will now relay information about an enemy <strong>only to those close to them</strong>. If the bot isn’t in a group, it can only shout to a maximum of 50 meters.</li>



<li>Only Raiders, Rogues, and Bosses will use suppressive fire mechanics. If a common AI enemy can’t see you, they won’t shoot you, which means no more wallbang deaths.</li>



<li>When an AI enemy is hit, it’ll suffer a considerable accuracy drop.</li>



<li>If a common AI enemy detects you at long range, they won’t immediately engage, but instead, they’ll deploy a ‘waiting tactic’ until you fire first.</li>
</ul>



<p>The general spawn rates, positions, and pathing systems for AI enemies have all been addressed. This means that one player won’t be able to trigger too many bot spawns, which will come in handy in PvE and getting swarmed by endless streams of Scavs.</p>



<p>Finally, AI enemies won’t move closely together or occupy the same areas of cover, which means less colliding and piling, which should also reduce stress on resources.</p>



<p>The full list of AI changes can be <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/334?utm_source=x_post&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=winter_drops_24-25&amp;utm_term=link_1&amp;utm_content=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found on escapefromtarkov.com</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, Battlestate Games has patched up some of the most irritating issues in Escape from Tarkov with this latest patch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Headshots are no longer deafening</li>



<li>The ‘arm/thorax damage issue’ has been resolved</li>



<li>Bots can no longer pass through closed doors</li>



<li>Error 228 has now been fixed</li>



<li>Transitions in PvE will no longer take you into a PvP game – thanks, BSG</li>

Meanwhile, Anby’s true identity gradually emerges, and Trigger, the teammate of Solider 11, will reveal more about the history of New Eridu’s military factions. With new foes including Geppetto in Hollow Zero and varied in-game events, Proxies can expect an enriched and exciting adventure.</p><p>In this new chapter of the main story, Proxies are determined to secure an artifact related to Sacrifice in an auction that has ignited tensions among different factions. Amidst the intrigue, Hugo and Vivian appear to be deliberately drawing close to the Proxies, blurring the line between ally and adversary. Beyond the main narrative, players will also uncover Anby’s past before her involvement with the Cunning Hares and gain deeper insights into New Eridu’s military force.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_947454"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Anby Demara used to be known as Soldier 0 – Anby, the former leader of the Silver Squad. She is an S-Rank Electric Attack Agent, wielding dual swords to rapidly deal Electric damage. Her attack triggers Aftershock as well as amplifying the CRIT DMG of allies targeting the same enemy. Alongside Soldier 0 – Anby, the new S-Rank character Trigger, an Electric Stun Agent and ace sniper of the Obol Squad, will make her debut. When entering Sniper Mode, Trigger can swiftly evade enemy attacks, striking at the opportune moment while calling in teammates for a Quick Assist. Her attack accumulates Purge, enhancing Aftershock damage and increasing damage dealt by allies on the same target. In addition, our familiar friend Pulchra Fellini is making her return in Version 1.6 as an A-Rank Physical Stun Agent under the banner of the Sons of Calydon. In the meantime, S-Rank Fire Anomaly Agent Burnice and S-Rank Ether Attack Agent Zhuyuan will also make their return in the rerun banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In Version 1.6, players will get to confront the new boss Geppetto in Hollow Zero and unlock the newly introduced Difficulty VI in Battlefront Purge. Furthermore, players can experience the new Hollow Zero gameplay Shadow Operation, featuring unique effects in every battle stage, such as increasing damage based on accumulated coins. In Trigger’s TV Schedule, a new third-person shooter gameplay will be introduced, allowing players to take on sniper missions. Additionally, Proxies can complete challenges as a Bangboo drone in the March On, Tiny Titan! event or aid a Bangboo in completing 10 different trials in the Little Knight’s Big Charge event to obtain exclusive rewards, including the playable agent Pulchra.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,963 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> via <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009763" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,492 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a></p><p>Watch the version 1.6 trailer and special program below.

                <p> The Command &amp; Conquer community is in for a treat, as EA has released the source code for four classic C&amp;C games, as well as adding Steam Workshop support and releasing further modding tools for other titles in the franchise.</p><p>In collaboration with community creator Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, EA has released the fully recovered source code for the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer/" data-ref-id="5000-1">Command &amp; Conquer</a> (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert/" data-ref-id="5000-686">C&amp;C Red Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-renegade/" data-ref-id="5000-2517">C&amp;C Renegade</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-generals/" data-ref-id="5000-4287">C&amp;C Generals</a>--along with its expansion pack, Zero Hour.

"As a long time modder, it was amazing to finally get a chance to deep dive into the source code for these games and see how they work!"</p><p>With the first Command &amp; Conquer now over 30 years old, CCHyper celebrates the release of its recovered source code as a win for video game preservation, saying the decision will help fan communities to "continue to support these games and keep them playable for future generations to come."</p><p>Alongside the release of the source code, EA is also releasing further tools for modders, as well as Steam Workshop support for multiple C&amp;C titles including: C&amp;C Renegade, C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour, C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kane’s Wrath, C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising, and C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight.

			<p>Despite what may have looked like, Ciri's model in The Witcher IV hasn't been changed in the recently released behind-the-scenes video, the game's director confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba provided a clarification on <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, saying that the behind-the-scenes video released earlier this week, which provided a look at how the game's reveal trailer was created, features the same in-game mode of Ciri seen in the reveal trailer shown during this year's The Game Awards show. What makes the model feel different is the fact that, in the behind-the-scenes video, the model is shown without facial animation, lighting or virtual camera lenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The behind-the-scenes video features the same in-game model of Ciri as seen in the original trailer. We have not modified it. What you’re seeing is raw footage—without facial animation, lighting, or virtual camera lenses. While it’s still in-engine, it represents a… <a href="https://t.co/krs0czANqK">https://t.co/krs0czANqK</a></p>

But there’s no time to dawdle as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-triumphant-light-officially-announced-ranked-battles-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Triumphant Light</a> is here. Like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-card-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mythical Island</a>, it’s a mini-set, and the god-like Arceus is front and center of the booster pack’s marketing. </p>

<p>The <strong>Gold Crown Arceus ex card</strong> is the holy grail of Triumphant Light. A <strong>Three-Star Arceus ex</strong> also awaits, as do a bunch of <strong>Two-Star</strong> cards ranging from Pokémon&nbsp;to Supporter cards.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> CEO Dan Clancy has published an <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/">open letter</a> detailing the company's plans for 2025, including new ways of collaborating, mobile improvements, and more monetisation.</p>
<p>After thanking the streaming community for an "amazing" 2024 - "More than ever, in today’s world, we all want and need to find belonging and connection with other people," said Clancy - the CEO listed new tools and opportunities for streamers, as well as new ways of building connection.</p>
<p>Collaboration is a "core part of Twitch", so following the Stream Together feature added last year, the company is working on shared hype trains and shared sub goals to drive revenue collaboratively. In addition, shared chat will be manageable in the mobile app for IRL streamers.</p>

<p>Speaking of mobile, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">Twitch re-launched its mobile app</a> (as announced at TwitchCon Europe), adding a Discovery Feed to find streamers based on recommendations. This year it will continue to revise the app, adding the ability to stream in both landscape and vertical video, and investing in the feed to aid discovery. Clips - short videos of a streamer's best moments - will also be easier to edit.</p>
<p>Perhaps most interestingly, Twitch is opening up monetisation for "most" streamers, such as subscriptions and bits. Usually streamers need to reach Affiliate status before monetisation tools kick in, but this year streamers will be able to start earning immediately. Of course, Twitch takes a cut of all monetisation, so it's as much of a benefit to the company as to streamers themselves.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the company is launching a new tool for streamers to let brands know they want to collaborate (sponsored streams are often more lucrative to streamers than subscriptions), and will also launch more promotional events.</p>
<p>Importantly, Twitch is continuing to focus on safety. This month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">Twitch updated its enforcement rules</a>; next it's looking to provide more detail on violations, and will expand moderator tools to make it easier to protect streams.</p>
<p>Lastly, Twitch will expand more of its Guilds (such as the Pride Guild) to a global community and include Ambassadors from around the world.</p>
<p>It's been a quieter start for the year for Twitch compared with 2024. It began last year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">over 500 layoffs</a> as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Clancy admitted the platform isn't profitable</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-staff-concerned-about-more-layoffs-later-this-year">report later in the year claimed staff were concerned about more layoffs</a> on the way and the future of the platform.</p>
<p>At TwitchCon Europe last year, I spoke with VP of product Jeremy Forrester about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">sustainability of the platform</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Crafting new armor is something you will be doing a lot in Monster Hunter Wilds, as it is a central part of its engaging gameplay loop. As you defeat more monsters and obtain new parts from them, you will be able to craft even more new armor pieces, which, with their stats and skills, will help you better define your character build. The game constantly offering you new armor to craft doesn't mean that you should always discard your old gear, as Monster Hunter Wilds, like previous entries in the series, gives you the option of upgrading every piece of gear to enhance its basic Defense stat.</p>

<p>To upgrade any armor piece in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will first need to make some progress in the game's main story campaign and complete<strong> Chapter 2-2</strong>. Once this is done, all you need to do to upgrade your armor is speak with Gemma at the <strong>Smithy</strong> and select the <strong>Upgrade From Box</strong> option, which will allow you to use Armor Spheres to increase any armor piece Defense value up until it reaches a certain level that varies per gear. The higher the rarity value of the gear you are upgrading, the more points will be needed to upgrade, so it is always a good idea to only focus on armor that you know you will use often, as, while the game is pretty generous when it comes to rewarding you with Armor Spheres, there will come a time with high rarity gear when upgrading any armor piece will become very expensive.</p>

			<p>A new Hogwarts Legacy patch is now live on PC, introducing new features to the game, including support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess2-frame-generation-low-latency-mode-smoother-gaming-first-titles/">Intel XeSS 2.</a></p>
<p>The February 27th patch primarily focuses on improving mod support with plenty of fixes, which include input prompt, text, and interface fixes. The patch also introduces some gameplay fixes for fast travel, Third Time's a Charm not being unlocked, silent restart falling with mods, and basic attacks leaving blank impacts on hit surfaces, among other fixes. The biggest new feature added to the game by the latest patch, however, is the introduction of Intel XeSS 2 support, specifically the frame generation features of Intel's tech that can only be used on Intel GPUs, both Alchemist and Battlemage. Extended NVIDIA Frame Generation features are also mentioned in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/990080/view/506195909797741136?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, although it is not yet clear what these are since the game already supports Multi Frame Generation on the NVIDIA RTX 5000 series.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy has been a smashing success since its release in 2023, so much so that the game is reportedly getting an <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/">expanded Definitive Edition</a> that will also receive DLC content. Avalanche Software is reportedly also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/">a second entry in the series</a> that will not be a live service game, which is definitely good news, considering how Warner Bros' recent<a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/"> live service offerings</a> have <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">turned out.</a></p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. You can learn more about the game by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">review.</a></p>
