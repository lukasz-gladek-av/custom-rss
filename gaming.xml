<p>Announced via a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">blog post</a>, you'll be able to carry over key progression across all relevant platforms, provided of course you actually own the game on multiple systems. This includes player level, unlocks, location mastery, campaign story progress, and more.</p>
<p>You'll need to ensure that you have an IOI Account and are signed into it on all relevant platforms to enable cross-progression. IO Interactive had included a <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full guide</a> on the steps and process necessary to achieve this.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_evSaRNgyaU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3otmzix&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>For now, here's the full list of everything included in cross-progression:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Experience<br>
- Player Level<br>
- Challenges<br>
- Location Mastery<br>
- Unlocks and Inventory<br>
- Achievements / Trophies<br>
- Freelancer Mode Progression<br>
- Campaign Story Progress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of course, just to be crystal clear, here's what <strong>won't</strong> be included:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Game license<br>
- DLC license<br>
- DLC-based unlocks<br>
- Leaderboard scores<br>
- Save Games (offline and online)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Our review</a> for the Switch 2 release of World of Assassination was largely positive, though we did take issue with the inconsistent performance on Nintendo's new console. Thankfully, IO Interactive has since introduced a new patch to lock the frame rate at 30fps, resulting in a more stable, enjoyable experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Erenshor</em>, described by developer and publisher Burgee Media as a "single-player simulated MMORPG", is getting a brand new update, and it's got a new class, a guild system, and more for you to try out.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, the game's new Rising Shadows update is coming on February 2nd. One of its main new features is the Reaver, a melee class that can fulfil tank, DPS, and utility roles thanks to its stance system. It's not dissimilar to <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Death Knight.</p><p>You can also look forward to a guild system that lets you create and join guilds, which Burgee Media says will add "a new layer of identity and progression" to <em>Erenshor</em>'s simulated MMO world.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're more of a solitary type, then you can take solace in the new Reliquary, a player space that you can decorate and customize using "found, crafted, and quest-earned statues", as well as "shrines, buffs, and other objects".</p><p>You can also use the Reliquary as a basis for fast travel, storing portal runes within it so you can move between locations and your home base with ease. Not only that, but you can summon your in-game friends to your Reliquary, as well as hosting auction houses, shops, and banks.</p><p>The new update also introduces a host of SimPlayer improvements, making <em>Erenshor</em>'s inhabitants feel even more lifelike, as well as new GM entities that will request you follow in-game rules if you find yourself feeling a little roguish.</p><p>All of this is in addition to lots of quality-of-life improvements that should make your experience in <em>Erenshor </em>feel that much smoother. If you're feeling like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c9e90e9-ffd4-4c64-91cc-0b15cda9f07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship</em></a><em> </em>is just a little too crowded, this one might be for you.</p>
<p><em>Erenshor </em>is a "single-player MMORPG" that aims to recreate the feeling of a classic MMO, only without the online multiplayer component.</p><p>It does so through technology Burgee calls SimPlayers, which, despite what you might think, aren't based on LLMs; instead, they use "a mixture of state machines and decision trees" to simulate real MMO players convincingly.</p><p>In essence, Burgee's goal is to build a living, breathing environment full of the same sort of things you'd find in a regular MMO, namely cities full of NPCs (and "players"), dungeons, lore to discover, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to see how successful Burgee has been at replicating that experience, you can check out <em>Erenshor </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2382520/Erenshor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>If you've been waiting to bless one of your friends with an entire dump truck worth of games in a series they've enjoyed one entry of, then good news. Valve have made Steam's 'complete the set' bundles giftable, with prices adjusting to match whichever bits the recipient might already own - so you're not in danger of hurling someone their second copy of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> on one storefront.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The steamywatchers over at <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3mctvj67hwf27">SteamDB</a> were  the first to spot that this sort of bundle gifting's now allowed. I've given it a quick test that involved momentarily holding the nearly £120 Fallout series bundle over the heads of several Steam friends.</p>
<p>You'll be glad to hear that the price changed in relation to the games in the bundle they already owned, just as happens if you go to buy one of these bundles for your own account. For one friend, I'd be playing somewhere in the region of £87 for the bits required to totally drown them in rads, while another would set me back only £71. That is, of course still wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy too much to pay to make sure someone owns both Fallout Tactics and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s extra fishing gear, but hey, maybe next time the sale rolls around.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a handy feature for Steam to offer. Not being able to dump all of the Yakuza/Like A Dragons on your mum at Christmas, alongside an email linking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">this article</a> ain't right. Now, to wait a full year for the opportunity to do it.</p><p>In other recent Steam-related news, Valve have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-no-longer-earn-steam-points-from-community-awards-as-valve-try-to-kill-off-clownface-farming">revamped their community award emojis</a> in an effort to stop people deliberately writing anger-inducing and clown sticker-attracting posts in order to earn Steam points they can spend on fancy profile backgrounds. I'm sure it'll work and I'll soon be able to read a discussion thread or review section without the risk of rolling my eyes so hard they plop out onto my desk.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/djis-new-released-osmo-mobile-8-gimbal-stabilizer-crashes-to-all-time-low-after-two-surprise-price-drops-built-in-extension-rod-and-tripod-2000661054</link>
            <guid>1410922</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to create content with your phone, there are some great options to help you better the way it looks and sounds. That includes a gimbal to make sure your picture stays static even when your phone or your subject is moving around. Case in point: The DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">If you’re interested in grabbing your own DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer, head to Amazon where you can get it for just $126, which is a $23 or 15% discount from the regular retail price of $149.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A stabilizing gadget to help improve your mobile photos and video</h2>
<p>This gadget is designed to produce smooth video and professional-looking results. It has AI-powered subject tracking (for subjects such as people and pets), and additional features like built-in light support and audio pickup. It even has 360-degree pan rotation for more creative movements, an extension rod and integrated tripod for transitioning between handheld shots and stationary shots without the need to swap equipment, and a stated 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The gimbal itself weighs approximately 13.1 ounces and the handle has been designed to fit comfortably in the user’s hand for extended periods of time. It even includes an extension rod to create space for a wider view for framing groups, overhead shots, etc.</p>



<p>Stabilization using robust 3-axis gimbal technology is the key to providing you with stabilized video footage when moving the gimbal around. The motors on the gimbal will adjust to your hand movements resulting in smoother footage than what would be produced by in-phone stabilization. Plus, its unlimited 360-degree horizontal pan allows for options to capture wrap-around movements and panoramic sweeps. The gimbal has features such as Timelapse, Motionlapse, Hyperlapse, and multiple panorama modes, which provide users with the ability to creatively compress time or stitch together large areas with minimal manual setup.</p>
<p>Tracking with audio and lighting is accomplished natively through the inclusion of the DJI OM Multifunctional Module, which brings several tools into one unit. The module can track individuals and pets, receive audio, and integrate with external light support to ensure your subject remains visible and well-lit.</p>
<p>Overall, this handheld gimbal works hard to deliver more stable footage, improved framing, and smoother movement for the photos and video you take on your phone. It accomplishes that with three-axis stabilization, unlimited 360-degree panning, the extension rod and tripod, and the Multifunctional Module.</p>
<p>For this price, and considering the fact that it’s often hard to find DJI products anymore, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">this a purchase you’re going to want to jump on right now before it’s out of stock again</a>. Be sure to grab yours fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 launched to high praise back in late 2025, and before long, Season 1 kicked off the live-service model for the title. Just as fans were beginning to get excited for Season 2, though, EA broke some very sour news—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-delays-start-battlefield-6-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 2 had been delayed</a>. </p>



<p>Instead of a new Season kicking off on January 20, it was revealed that Season 2 had been pushed back to February 17, leaving three weeks devoid of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>. Luckily for fans, EA has revealed its short-term plans to fill the gap with the Frostfire Bonus Path.</p>







<p>If you’re still playing Battlefield 6 and eager for new content, check out what’s in store while you wait for Season 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New content isn’t too far off. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Frostfire Bonus Path is a new pathway of rewards coming alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, launching on January 27, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>At this moment in time, the full Bonus Path hasn’t been shared online, but some details have been made available. Rewards will range from a new Weapon Package and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-fans-art-copy-call-of-duty-ghosts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soldier Skin</a> to various XP Boosts.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not all of it will come for free. EA have confirmed that some content will require the purchase of the Season 1 Battle Pass. Here are some of the upcoming Frostfire Bonus Path content broken down into free and paid rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Free Rewards</th><th data-align="center">Paid Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Hardware XP Boost</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Package</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Skin</td><td data-align="center">Career XP Boost</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Playercard Customization Items</td><td data-align="center">Additional Customization Items</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-are-rewards-unlocked-on-the-frostfire-bonus-path-in-battlefield-6">How Are Rewards Unlocked On The Frostfire Bonus Path In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hopefully more maps are on the horizon. Image by EA.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rewards on the Frostfire Bonus Path are unlocked with Bonus Path Points; these are earned by completing Weekly Challenges.</strong></p>



<p>The Frostfire Bonus Path can be completed alongside the Season 1 Battle Pass, so you won’t need to choose to make progress between the prior paths and the new one. To make progress through the Bonus Path, though, you’ll need Bonus Path Points, with every ten unlocking a new reward.</p>







<p>Weekly Challenges are the source of these points, but the amount of points varies depending on the difficulty of the challenge. That being said, not all Weekly Challenges reward Bonus Path Points, so be sure to check the in-game Challenges menu for more detailed information.</p>

            <guid>1410901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Concept artwork for Microsoft's upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a> reboot has been shared online, showing what looks to be a large open world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The images, originally highlighted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a>, reportedly originate from an unnamed artist who previously worked on the project at British development studio Playground Games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than two dozen images show brooding fantasy landscapes that stretch off into the horizon, dilapidated thatched cottages in pastoral scenes, and familiar-looking towns with spired roofs. Several images also make reference to "Bloodstone" — suggesting we'll see locations from past Fable games return.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the images offer a slightly darker color palette than seen in Lionhead's original Fable trilogy, with moody skies and a rugged world that's reminiscent of Hogwarts Legacy. How big is Fable's new world? That remains to be seen, though perhaps it featuring large open spaces shouldn't be too surprising, since it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-is-being-developed-using-the-forza-engine">being built on the same open world engine that powers Forza Horizon</a> (albeit likely with fewer cars).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another set of art showcases a dank dungeon-like area, where water pours down through sewer-like tunnels as cages hang above. One particular image sees the hero confront a werewolf-like creature, as bodies hang in chains nearby.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While concept art naturally shows a work-in-progress look at a project, this werewolf encounter has popped up in a previous trailer. The hero figure used throughout the concept art also matches the character seen in trailers released over the last couple of years. The suggestion, then, is this vision of the game likely isn't too far off the finished article — though of course we'll be seeing much more of it later this week to find out for ourselves. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's annual Xbox Developer Direct showcase will air this Thursday, January 22 at 10am PT, and include gameplay footage of Playground Games' long-awaited new take on Fable, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, Game Freak action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beast-of-reincarnation">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, and more.

                <p>In the five years since its release, Hitman: World of Assassination has hit multiple platforms, with Agent 47 infiltrating multiple PC storefronts, mobile devices, and even the original Switch through a cloud version of the game. In just a couple of weeks, players will be able to sync their progress across all platforms through cross-progression.</p><p>Developer IO Interactive marked the stealth-action game's fifth anniversary with a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing how cross-progression will work once the feature goes live on February 3. Challenge progression, inventory, and even achievements will be stored online, ensuring that your experiences with Agent 47 seamlessly carry over no matter which platform you play on.</p><p>The one caveat is that you can only pull from one "primary" save with cross-progression enabled. That's easy for anyone who perhaps owns Hitman on one platform and wants to switch to a new platform, but those who have saves on different platforms will have to choose just one of them to carry over. But if you're precious about each of your distinct saves, do know that cross-progression is reversible.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Hitman/status/2013581802493952438?s=20" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Mark your calendars 📅, Cross-Progression is coming to HITMAN World of Assassination on February 3rd.<br>Your progression will now follow you no matter where you choose to play. 💻🎮⌨️🖱️<br>Get all the details on the upcoming release in our blog post and let us know which platform… <a href="https://t.co/FuAAMedCU4" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/FuAAMedCU4">pic.twitter.com/FuAAMedCU4</a><br></p>— HITMAN (@Hitman) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/2013581802493952438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/Hitman/status/2013581802493952438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a><br></blockquote>              </div><p>Originally released as Hitman 3 in 2021 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-has-officially-been-renamed-adds-new-freelancer-mode/1100-6510886/" data-ref-id="1100-6510886" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-3-has-officially-been-renamed-adds-new-freelancer-mode/1100-6510886/">its renaming in 2023</a>, Hitman: World of Assassination includes levels from 2016's Hitman and 2018's Hitman 2.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>As we prepare for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, set to finally launch in May, and celebrate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-world-of-assassination-all-time-classic">Hitman 3's five-year anniversary</a>, we've received news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> is, at long last, getting cross-progression support.</p>
<p>We figured this would happen at some point, especially after last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port and with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hitman/new-game-after-world-of-assassination-co-op">more content set to arrive this year</a>, but with all eyes on James Bond's game right now, it was hard to predict its arrival. Today, 20th January, <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account">IOI confirmed</a> the feature will be available starting 3rd February. Additionally, a "brand-new, fresh look launches today" for the IOI Account service on browsers and mobile phones.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://ioisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/32645592211229-HITMAN-World-of-Assassination-Cross-Progression-Guide">full cross-progression guide</a> with FAQ was shared, but the gist of the news is that players will be able to take their Hitman: WoA (the combination of Hitman 1, 2, and 3 under a single roof) progress with them no matter what device they play on. For example, you could launch your PC save on the PS5 in your living room and later continue your killing sprees on the go with the Switch 2 version... as long as you have access to an online connection.</p>
<p>IOI also revealed that a Steam patch (3.250.1) will be arriving next week, which will ensure everything is working for the new cross-progression functionality. Players will have to select, after logging on their IOI Account, a "primary platform" the other devices will follow. Game licences, DLC purchases, and unlocks tied to DLCs aren't shared, meaning you'll have to own all required content on each platform where you want to use cross-progression. That's how the feature has always worked, but it's good to remind the more casual crowd of its limitations.</p><p>On the matter of the saves themselves, IOI also notes "old save games created on a non-primary linked account will not be loadable while Cross-Progression is active." In summary, the system will only recognize saves tied to the IOI Account system, so we recommend making sure everything's properly updated and connected if you intend to embrace this feature.</p>
<p>As a footnote, IOI has also reminded players the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> to 3 "carryover" process will close come 3rd February so all progress is locked to the latest iteration of the three-part sandbox game. The company's approach to progression and upgrades has always been slightly too convoluted and often led to confusion, so it makes sense the devs are being extra careful ahead of this major feature drop.</p>
<p>If you're waiting for news on Hitman's future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/of-course-there-will-be-more-hitman-after-007-first-light-io-interactive-assures">IOI hasn't shied away from teasing there are plans in place</a>, but don't expect a reveal until World of Assassination's co-op mode and 007 First Light are out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284</link>
            <guid>1410871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, a mod that combines the world maps of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-director-sawyer-xbox-bethesda-1851620259"><i><span> Fallout 3 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i></a><span>, won’t be getting ported to (or otherwise remade for) those long-rumored remasters and remakes. One of the best ways to experience the wasteland will remain anchored to the older games..</span></p> <p><span>The existence of upcoming new versions of Bethesda’s</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> might be the worst-kept secret in gaming right now, much like </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </span></i><span>was prior to its release last year</span><span>. If this is the first you’re hearing of this, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><span>here’s </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s breakdown</span></a><span> of why everyone is so convinced that the remasters are on the way.</span></p>

 <p><span>The community is understandably excited, with said excitement at least partially fueled by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">success of <em>Fallout </em>season 2</a> </span><span>on Prime. But a remastered version of either game comes with the same potential headache as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-steam-mixed-review-ue5-stuttering-2000624074"><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i></a><span> did</span><span>: a lack of support for close to two decades of mods.</span></p>  <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> is concerned, Bethesda </span><a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672"><span>outright confirmed</span></a><span> at release that “mods are not officially supported” for the game. This didn’t stop the modding community from </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/"><span>finding workarounds</span></a><span> for certain classic </span><i><span>Oblivion </span></i><span>mods, but the end result is clear: the original </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivion/mods"><span>2006 release</span></a><span> of the game has ten times the number of mods on popular mod distribution site Nexus Mods that </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=downloads"><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> has</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/19/161756.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span>, at least one huge total conversion mod for both </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> won’t be making the jump to the current generation, as confirmed by the team behind </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>in their Discord server. Why? Because, understandably, producing a version of </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> that works with both remasters “would be a mammoth effort and would require an entire rebuild of the project.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Tale of Two Wastelands</em> feels like its own game</h2> <p><span>If you haven’t played </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span> for yourself, let me be the first to tell you that you really should. Merely describing it as a way to play through both games with a single character is massively underselling it, because it doesn’t just smoosh the Mojave and the Capital Wasteland together.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>overhauls both games in a way that makes the experience truly cohesive by completely rebalancing the game, altering the level cap and perks, and even restoring a bunch of cut content. It’s such a huge undertaking that it even has its own separate tag on Nexus, with over 1,200 support mods of its own. The </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> team aren’t exaggerating when </span><a href="https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/faq.html"><span>they describe the project</span></a><span> as its own “unique game.”</span></p> <p><span>Ever since I first tried <em>TTW </em>back in 2019, I haven’t returned to the standalone versions of either </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> or</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span>. It obviously sucks to hear that the project won’t be supported once the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remasters drop, even if it’s completely understandable. We can only hope that Bethesda makes a better effort to support legacy mods this time around, but, in the case of </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, we may have to make peace with the fact that some <em>Fallout</em> modding projects are simply too grand in scope to get ported to their remastered counterparts.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final VR3000 EX Gaming Headset Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/20/final-vr3000-ex-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>1410844</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes, you need to be the adult in the room. Yes, alright, you spend all your spare time pretending to be samurai, alien soldiers or perhaps Spider-Man, but that doesn’t mean you’re immature, it just means you still have a somewhat active imagination. Japanese audio specialist Final seem to know that being a gamer doesn’t necessarily mean having the same taste in decor and fashion as an eleven-year-old, and their latest over-ear headset, the Final VR3000 EX, is a reflection of that, with some of the most grown-up vibes I’ve ever seen in a gaming headset.</p>
<p>First up is its timeless all-black colour scheme. Black earpieces, black headband, black wiring. Heck, even the logos are a different shade of black. There’s some shared design language with the Razer BlackShark, but without even a hint of neon green, leaving us with an understated, smart and serious-looking headset. By that virtue, it stands out, whether it’s against similarly sensible headsets that still flash a bit of chrome, or the RGB-heavy and gamer-centric designs from other peripheral makers.</p>
<p>The VR3000 EX feels very sturdy in your hands as well, though I did notice a little creaking when I initially took it out of the box. One of my favourite things was the quality of the headband materials, with a mesh fabric housing a significant layer of memory foam to keep things comfortable.</p>



<p>Comfort levels are furthered by the leatherette ear cushions, which are soft and pliable. They, and the earpieces themselves, provide a decent level of passive noise cancellation, but there is a downside to their sound-isolating qualities. The VR3000 EX are amongst the warmest headphones I’ve tested recently, and you’ll definitely notice the rush of cool air against your ears when you remove them.</p>

<p>The fold-up microphone is of the short and stubby variety, but it still picked up my voice clearly, despite not being all that close to my mouth. You can angle it ever so slightly towards you, but if you like an adaptable mic location, you will want to look elsewhere. Still, it’s extremely easy to tuck out of the way, and it moulds well enough into its slot that you can’t really tell it’s there if you were planning to use these headphones outside of the house.</p>
<p>The VR 3000 EX can easily leave the house with you too, as they connect via both Bluetooth 5.3 and a 2.4Ghz USB-A wireless transmitter. That means they’ll play nice with your Switch 2, your phone or tablet, as well as PS5, PS4 and PC. My only complaint was that the USB-A transmitter doesn’t work with Switch 2, meaning you’re stuck with a higher latency, lower-quality Bluetooth connection, rather than the pristine low-latency vibes afforded to Sony gamers.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the audio sounds very good whichever connection method you’re using. Final have made a lot about the wide soundstage, which allows further immersion and definition to 3D audio spaces, and for a closed back headset, it’s got a great amount of natural spacing that really helps to immerse you in whatever content you’re consuming.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing a heck of a lot of Final Fantasy Remake Integrade on the Switch 2, on our way to review, and the VR 3000 EX provided the perfect audio partner for Cloud’s journey from grouchy merc to slightly-less grouchy merc.</p>
<p>The orchestral soundtrack of Final Fantasy Remake does a lot of heavy lifting in terms of emotion and drama, and the VR 3000 EX sounds pretty spectacular, with a clean, detailed delivery that ensures you’re getting every single aspect of the game, from soundtrack through to the effects and expansive amount of dialogue. Out of the box, there’s a pleasant dose of bass and depth, though you can then tune this right up with the 10-band custom equaliser available in the mobile app.</p>
<p>The quality of the EQ makes the VR3000 EX a perfect partner for listening to music too, giving my regular mix of synthwave and metalcore a suitable platform to blast my ears off. It’s a shame that we’re stuck with plain old AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, missing out on the lossless audio that’s available elsewhere, but music still sounded fantastic.</p>
<p>Listening to Starset’s newest song – it’s the soundtrack to the new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ00ggFb8A0">Arknights: Endfield launch trailer</a> – the sci-fi tones of the opening and the soaring vocal chants cut through perfectly above the blasts of distorted guitar and the thump of Adam Gilbert’s drumming. It’s an excellent result, and whatever you’re listening to, it’s safe to say that the Final VR 3000 EX sound awesome.</p>
<p>There’s lots of incremental steps to the volume dial here, which is great in terms of getting things just right, but does mean you find yourself making multiple rotations at times to turn it significantly up or down. Besides that, the other controls all appear on the left-hand earcup, with the FPS-focused Footstep Clarity available via the C button, while MODE button switches between Bluetooth and the wireless dongle, with a long hold to enter pairing. It’s pretty straightforward once you’re clear on the headset’s options.</p>

<p>That said, Final are trying their best to confuse me with the way they’re doing mobile apps. Previously, the Final Connect app controlled a bunch of their earbuds, including the very similarly named <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/final-vr3000-wireless-earbuds-review/">VR3000 earbuds</a>, but their two most recent headsets have their own, single headset app. Now, for most people, that probably won’t cause any issues, but for me, it’s just a weird bit of needless phone bloat.</p>
<p>The app is a fairly no-frills affair, but the equaliser is responsive and offers enough variability that you’ll definitely be able to tune the audio to exactly where you want it to be. Besides that, you can activate the Footstep mode here, update the firmware, or read the manual, and that’s pretty much your lot. It’s as straightforward and unassuming as the headset itself, doing exactly what you need, without any hassle or complication.</p>
<p>Currently available for £89.99, the VR3000 EX is great value, especially given its dual connection options and demure looks. It’s right in the same wheelhouse as the latest <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/19/turtle-beach-stealth-500-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth 500</a>, which is definitely lighter and less warm, but lacks the solidity and build quality of the VR3000 EX. The quality of the audio and the wider soundstage of the Final headset take you that step further in terms of immersion too, but the Stealth 500 edges it in overall comfort.</p>

<figure data-uuid="12a6d697a504d"><a title="Hasbro / Doug" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12a6d697a504d/hasbro-doug.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following his retirement as President and COO of Nintendo of America, Doug Bowser has now joined the board of directors for toy manufacturer Hasbro.</p>
<p>This news come <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">directly from Hasbro</a> itself, with the firm confirming the appointment of Bowser alongside Carla Vernón, CEO of The Honest Company, a digital-first consumer goods company founded by actress Jessica Alba.</p>
<p>Hasbro, of course, is much more than a mere toy manufacturer, and owns the trademarks and products of Kenner, Milton Bradley, Parker Brothers, and Wizards of the Coast. The latter company is responsible for the ludicrously popular <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> and <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong>, while huge brands like <strong>Transformers</strong> and <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> also fall under Hasbro.</p>
<p>Here's what Rich Stoddart, Chair of Hasbro's Board of Directors, had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We are delighted to have Doug and Carla join our seasoned and dynamic Board of Directors. Doug and Carla bring extensive leadership experience across consumer brands and franchise management. Their expertise and guidance will be invaluable as Hasbro continues to execute its long-term innovation and growth strategy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Doug Bowser's successor at Nintendo, Devon Pritchard, has kicked off 2026 as Nintendo of America's new President and COO. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/im-excited-to-meet-you-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-public-appearance-as-president-of-noa">She made her first public appearance</a> in the role at the 15th Annual New York Game Awards, delivering a pre-recorded message to praise the event and the nonprofit 'Playing With Purpose' writing programme.</p>
<p>Chances are we won't see much of Doug Bowser in the months and years ahead as he works behind the scenes at Hasbro, but hey, maybe he'll have a say in whether <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes to the Switch 2, huh?</p>

            <guid>1410838</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of tomorrow's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/">Xbox Developer Direct 2026</a>,</strong> the rest of the games coming to <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> for January 2026 and heading into February have been revealed, with an additional <strong>10 games</strong> joining the subscription service, including <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-directors-cut-ill-keep-coming/">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a></strong>, and <strong>The Talos Principle 2.</strong></p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-january-2026-games-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws/">games already added from the start of the month</a>, which one user described as a "<em>damn good month</em>," another user on ResetEra called this back-half a "<em>really good batch</em>" of games. In total, subscribers get <strong>17 new games</strong> to check out as part of their Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Premium members only miss out on three of the titles joining the service this month, whereas anyone on the Essential tier is missing out on, well, all of them. </p>



<p>So far, since <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">Microsoft raised the prices on Game Pass subscriptions and reorganized it</a></strong> into the three tiers (Ultimate, Premium, and Essential), it's been clear that the bottom 'Essential' tier is really just for those who want to be able to use Cloud services and play games online. If you want access to the Game Pass library of games, you need to be at least at the middle-level Premium tier, and Microsoft makes subscribers aware of this every time a new batch of Game Pass games includes nothing for players on the Essential tier.</p>



<p>On the flip side, while Microsoft is seemingly making players aware that Essential is the worst deal among the Game Pass options, it is also consistently making them aware that just paying for PC Game Pass is the best deal. Of course, this isn't a good option for console players, but if you have the means to just play on your PC, it's easily your best bet as you're still getting everything Ultimate subscribers are getting at a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>But if you're paying for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, or even just Game Pass Premium, then beyond the aforementioned titles like Space Marine 2, The Talos Principle 2, and Death Stranding, you also have 2024's indie hit, <strong>Indika</strong>, 2025's excellent action-platformer, <strong>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</strong>, and the physics-driven driving sim, <strong>RoadCraft</strong>, to look forward to this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games joining Xbox Game Pass for the rest of January 2026, when they'll arrive, where you can play them, and what subscription tier you need to be at to access them:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding: Director's Cut - January 21 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>RoadCraft - January 21 - PC - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Ninja Gaiden Ragebound - January 21 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Talos Principle 2 - January 27 - PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Anno: Mutationem - January 28 - Cloud, PC, Console - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Drop Duchy - January 28 - Cloud, PC, Console - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>MySims: Cozy Bundle - January 29 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - January 29 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Indika - February 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Final Fantasy II  - February 3 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>As always, with games coming into the service, others are leaving. As of January 15, five games were removed from the service, most notably Neon White. This time, on <strong>January 31, 2026</strong>, an additional six games are leaving the service, with a couple of notable departures, including Citizen Sleeper 2 and Lonely Mountains Snow Riders.</p>



<p>You have until January 31 to play the following six games through Xbox Game Pass:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shady Part of Me</li>



<li>Starbound</li>



<li>Lonely Mountains Snow Riders</li>



<li>Paw Patrol World</li>



<li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li>



<li>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</li>
</ul>

<p>As "increasingly complex tactical scenarios" play out, <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will throw new challenges at you, including the use of artillery, which Tactical Board says "emphasizes the importance of troop maneuvering" as well as "reinforcing the importance of positioning and timing" in battle.</p><p>Despite this strategic depth, the studio says <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will offer "accessible, fast-paced gameplay", so if you're not a real-time strategy genius, then you should still find something to enjoy here.</p><p>Unlike many other RTS games, this one won't offer any multiplayer features, either; Tactical Boar says the game will be "a focused single-player experience", so don't expect to be taking on your friends here anytime soon.</p><p>You can check out the debut trailer for <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which should be red meat for you if you're a <em>Total War </em>fan (and you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7067fdbf-b9ab-4e47-903f-e0733b54d97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">disappointed with more recent releases</a>), right here.</p>
<p>There is, admittedly, not a ton of information in said trailer, but <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>doesn't have a release date yet, so that's probably fair enough.

<p>That's exactly what the RuneScape makers have done to kick off the opening section of the 2026 roadmap they talk through in the video above and <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=news/the-roadmap-that-changes-runescape-forever">this post</a>. The gist of what they've dubbed the game's "Road to Restoration" is that they're hoping to make sure that RuneScape's put firmly back on track and set up for a bright future as it rings its 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Hence the ditching of the Treasure Hunter microtransactions, with their items set to be driven into extinction in the long-run to boot. "Over the course of 2026, players will have the opportunity to use up any existing stockpiles, with additional chances later in the year to clear out anything that remains, before these items are ultimately made obsolete," Jagex wrote.</p><p>Along with Treasure's removal, the winter update which has just gone live delivers a few other bits. There's a retooled user interface designed to work back in some classic RuneScape furniture like a circular minimap and the option to toggle cosmetics like wings into an invisible form if they bother you. plus, there's been a worldspace update focusing on free-to-play locales like Lumbridge, Draynor, and Varrock.</p>
<p>Moving forward through the rest of the year, regular larger additions like the two-part Havenhythe expansion, player-owned housing, and player avatars will be packaged with more revamping of existing features. For example, spring promises a combat update that'll aim to modernise the three base fighting styles by adding the likes of a basic attack and retooling abilities which are no longer fit for purpose, while three rounds of general balancing tweaks are penned in across the year. The RuneMetrics stat-tracking system is also set to drop the Pro part of its price of entry, instead being offered to all paid RuneScape members.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like a number of steps in the right direction, albeit with the caveat of Jagex needing to do all of this re-integritising because they'd jumped so far into the integrityless microtransaction waters to start with.</p>

            <guid>1410820</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a splendidly combative interview with Razer’s billionaire CEO Min-Liang Tan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview"><em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel took him to task</a> over the peripheral company’s approach to AI, not least including the Grok-powered <a href="https://kotaku.com/grok-hologram-anime-waifu-ces-2026-2000657749">waifu-AI-in-a-jar stunt</a> it pulled at this year’s CES. The hour-long interview gets more and more uncomfortable as it becomes clear Tan has no answers for any of the crucial questions Patel is putting to him. And just wait until he’s asked what games he’s played recently.</p> <p>The interview, which took place live on stage at 2026’s CES, has such a peculiar tone. <em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel makes pretty obviously cynical remarks about Razer’s approach in terms of the attention-seeking silliness it pretends to be developing, and Min-Liang Tan replies as if the questions are entirely sincere. Of the Ava AI tube, “Did you say to your team, ‘I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk’? You say the metric is ‘what we want.’ Who was like, ‘I want this’?” asks Patel. Tan then launches into a deeply sincere response about how the holo-lady was there to represent technology Razer can create for game companies, meeting an imagined desire for “a holographic representation of some of your latest characters,” and that the product demonstrates “we’re now able to get personality there and have conversational AI coming through,” and further that it isn’t just “great software” but now features “great intelligence.”</p>

 <p>As impossible as it is to think of a single use-case for a game character appearing in a physical tube and being able to spurt Grok responses back at people, Tan enthuses, “It’s that premise of being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.” It’s “a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, ‘Hey, it’s a great concept,’ and I think the community loves it.”</p>  <p>Ava, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava">which has a website</a> that’s taking $20 preorder deposits and states that the product “is expected to be available in the second half of 2026,” is certainly not going to be released then, if at all, as becomes awkwardly obvious as the interview continues. When pressed on the reality of Ava actually being developed as a consumer product, rather than something “hack[ed] together” for CES, Tan starts to prevaricate. “We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on?” Which are all <em>really</em> strange questions to be asking of a product that’s supposedly going on sale later this year. Not least one that’s planning to run on Grok, Elon Musk’s wildly unstable and poorly managed AI.</p>

 <p>“Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?” asked Patel, with the interview taking place as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">the stories of Grok’s gleeful creation of revenge porn and CSAM</a> were breaking. Tan does not answer the question at all, but rather speaks of Grok’s “really great conversational AI model.” When Patel puts to him the other obvious issues of a Grok-powered conversational device, Tan gives some of the most astonishingly dreadful responses, such as declaring, “Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi,” and “we’ve interacted with NPCs.” Patel desperately persists, laboring over the point that intentions are meaningless when we all know what gen-AI is already doing, but Tan refuses to engage, instead just repeating the usual lines about “software guardrails” and how the tech is [deep sigh] “evolving.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661262">© Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>Patel continues heroically on. When asking Tan about glowy-keyboard company Razer’s intentions to invest $600 million into “AI” alongside employing 150 AI engineers, the host points out “that gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms.” This obviously hits rather close to home for the Razer CEO, who arrived at CES under the banner of “AI is the future of gaming.”</p> <p>Tan attempts to draw a line between the “AI slop” that most game players are currently revolting against, and the nebulous “AI tools” that will help developers with QA and cause them to “develop better games.” He talks of a “QA companion” that Razer is developing to “work with the human QA tester” by, um, filling in forms. Genuinely, that’s the example.</p>

 <p>But as much as Patel pushes, Tan never provides an actual example of a compelling use case. Instead it’s all about how “helpful” it will be, how it’ll “work with” current products, but never with a single concrete example of what he’s actually talking about. But it is, of course, “revolutionary.” Thank goodness for Patel, who jumps in at this point to demand that Tan explain what exactly is “revolutionary” about putting a camera with “AI” in it in some headphones in Razer’s Motoko. The answer: “Well, I would say, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.” Ho boy. It’s ChatGPT talking at you in your ears. And, more specifically, an imaginary future version of ChatGPT that can interpret live camera footage and ambient audio and provide related answers based on these feeds.</p> <p>And for all of Tan’s protestations that Razer isn’t interested in “slop,” he then goes on to deliver that hoary old line, “We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout.” So yeah, just plagiarized slop then.</p> <p>And just in case it couldn’t get any worse, Patel finishes up by asking Tan—who repeatedly declared his love for gaming throughout—what games he’s playing right now. “Oh, it depends.” Nope. On a second try he says, “<em>Civilization</em> and stuff like that…I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre.” Patel points out those are genres and desperately presses for the name of a game. “Oh, well, I play random stuff.” Fucking hell.</p>

            <guid>1410817</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping multiple devices charged has become a daily challenge. Smartphones are just the starting point—add in wireless earbuds, smartwatches, tablets, laptops, and handheld gaming consoles, and it’s easy to see how quickly outlets and charging bricks multiply. A single, powerful charger that can handle everything is no longer a luxury. It is an absolute necessity. That’s why you need an Anker laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Amazon happens to have it on sale at the moment for 35% off. It normally runs for $100, so that discounts easily calculates out to a savings of $35.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Charging</h2>
<p>Designed as an all-in-one charging hub, this compact power brick is built to replace several individual chargers at once. It supports USB-C charging across a wide range of devices, from phones and accessories to full-sized laptops and gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or similar handhelds. With a maximum output of up to 140W, it delivers a ton of power fast helping to minimize the time it takes to bring your devices back to life.</p>
<p>At the front of the charger, you’ll find three USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to four devices simultaneously. The first two USB-C ports support the highest power output, so either can be used for fast-charging a laptop without sacrificing performance. The USB-A port ensures compatibility with older cables and accessories you may still rely on, keeping the charge valuable for even your legacy devices.</p>
<p>Fast charging performance is a highlight. The Anker Laptop Charger is capable of powering larger devices and laptops like the 15-inch MacBook Air rapidly. Under optimal conditions, it can bring a drained laptop battery up to 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>



<h2>Smart Display</h2>
<p>A built-in smart display located on the top of the unit provides real-time charging information, breaking down how much power each port is delivering as well as the total output across all connected devices. The high-definition, full-color display makes the information easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>The display also doubles as a temperature monitor. Keeping charging temperatures in check is critical for both safety and long-term device health, and the charger gives you visibility into how warm it’s running. Behind the scenes, Anker’s ActiveShield safety system continuously monitors temperature—checking millions of times per day—to protect against overheating and ensure stable performance.</p>
<p>In the box, Anker includes the 140W charger itself and a five-foot USB-C to USB-C cable rated for up to 240W, so you can take full advantage of its capabilities right away. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Available in dark gray or silver, the Anker laptop charger is now on sale for just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is getting a cross-progression update on February 3, 2026. </p>



<p>It has been a long time since we received an update for Hitman: World of Assassination. The last update we saw was a big one, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eminem-joins-hitman-world-of-assassination-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eminem</a> was announced as part of an Elusive Target Mission in the game. Now, the latest update doesn’t feature any content, but it’s still handy for players who play across different platforms. </p>







<h2 id="h-hitman-world-of-assassination-cross-progression-details">Hitman: World of Assassination Cross Progression Details </h2>



<p>As revealed in the new <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Hitman: World of Assassination’s Cross-Progression update will allow players to carry their in-game progression to any device they choose. Ahead of the update, a Steam patch will be released to ensure the feature works properly before it is released to the public. </p>



<p>While the Cross Progression feature is enabled, players can store and share their progress online across devices linked to the user’s IOI account. One device will serve as their primary progression profile, and all other platforms will be linked to it. While using cross-progression in Hitman: World of Assassination, Game License, DLC License, and DLC-based unlocks will not be shared, only the following data is shared across all platforms: </p>



<ul>
<li>Experience&nbsp;</li>



<li>Player Level&nbsp;</li>



<li>Challenges&nbsp;</li>



<li>Location Mastery&nbsp;</li>



<li>Unlocks and Inventory&nbsp;</li>



<li>Achievements / Trophies&nbsp;</li>



<li>Freelancer Mode Progression&nbsp;</li>



<li>Campaign Story Progress&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The DLC content should be owned on the platform they are playing, or else it won’t be accessible. Additionally, old save games from non-primary devices cannot be loaded via cross-progression; to load them, you will have to turn off the feature. Additionally, the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover process will be disabled from February 3, once cross-progression launches for Hitman: World of Assassination. </p>







<p>In other news, Hitman 4 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-4-unofficially-confirmed-by-io-interactive-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unofficially revealed</a> by the IO Interactive CEO last month.

            <title><![CDATA[Russia’s ‘Call of Duty’ Could Cost 10 Billion Rubles, But The Government is Ready]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-call-of-duty-10-billion-rubles-government-ready/</link>
            <guid>1410808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Russia is still preparing to make good on a promise to create a homegrown rival to Call of Duty. The dream is edging closer to reality, as government ministries signal they are prepared to offer immense financial support, tax breaks, and other incentives to <strong>any Russian studio </strong>willing to take on the gargantuan task.</p>



<p>The idea, which was first pushed by State Duma deputy Mikhail Delyagin, has now procured an official response from Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development. The numbers being lobbied are <strong>staggering</strong>, and the appropriate bodies could grant as much as <strong>10 billion rubles </strong>($128 million) to the right studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-russia-s-call-of-duty-clone-could-become-reality">Russia’s Call of Duty Clone Could Become Reality</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve discussed Russia’s gaming aspirations in recent years. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/">Vladimir Putin ordered</a> Russian tech titans to manufacture a range of home consoles that could eventually compete with the likes of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. That front has gone somewhat quiet, but a new, software-based dream has emerged.</p>



<p>Russia wants to make a Call of Duty competitor.</p>



<p>According to an original report from <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2026/01/20/27657577.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gazeta.Ru</a> (and circulated by <a href="https://ixbt.games/en/news/2026/01/20/instituta-razvitiia-interneta-podderzit-sozdanie-rossiiskogo-analoga-call-of-duty.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IXBT</a>), the ministry <strong>confirmed </strong>that developers who propose a large-scale military shooter that echoes Activision’s Call of Duty could qualify for support from the Internet Development Institute, one of Russia’s key state-funded digital initiatives.</p>



<p>But how much support is the government offering?</p>



<p>Early estimates suggest that building a Russian AAA shooter on par with Call of Duty could cost as much as 10 billion rubles, or around $124 million. It would easily make it amongst the most expensive gaming-related projects in the nation’s history. It <strong>has </strong>been stressed before that ‘no domestic studio’ could accomplish the task without substantial government support.</p>



<p>Hence, the lobbying for a potentially enormous grant.</p>



<p>The quote from the Ministry reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If the IRI receives an application for the allocation of funding for the development of a game on a topic corresponding to that indicated in your letter, it will be considered in the established procedure within the framework of the current competitive mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Beyond potential funding, the Ministry of Digital Development reminded Russian reporters that the government offers a ‘suite of financial benefits’ for IT companies innovating like this. That includes reduced corporate income tax rates, lowered insurance premiums, and partial VAT exemptions.</p>



<p>This news comes mere weeks after the State Duma, the ‘lower house’ of Russia’s parliament, called for an investigation into Call of Duty. By their claims, the franchise preaches Russophobia, by ‘always’ making the ‘bad guy’ a Russian individual or group.</p>



<p>It has been suggested that Russia’s Call of Duty would flip the script, allowing users to fight against American, British, and Ukrainian forces. It was dubbed a ‘strategically important’ game for Russia, but whether it would leave the confines of the country is another thing entirely.</p>







<p>Do you think Russia’s game developers could ever muster up the ability to create a Call of Duty rival? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>Following the reveal of its release date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a> has seen a surge of interest as PC players have begun locking in preorders for Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter. At the time of writing, Marathon is the fifth-best-selling game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" rel="nofollow ">Steam in the US</a> and 10th globally on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" rel="nofollow ">Steam Charts</a>. Free-to-play games like Marvel Rivals and Counter-Strike 2 are ahead of it--only natural, given the low price of nothing for those titles--and Arc Raiders is still in the top spot for now.</p><p>This is a positive step forward for the game, considering last year's controversy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/">over alleged stolen art assets</a> and the lukewarm reception since its reveal. It's also worth noting that Marathon will be available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S at launch, but sales data for those platforms isn't currently available to gauge player interest. Marathon was originally aiming to launch in September last year--a release date that would have brought it perilously close to the mega-successful Arc Raiders.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marathon | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>It's now scheduled to launch on March 5, which gives it a fairly comfortable window to make its sales mark. The Steam preorders suggest it'll launch on PC with considerable momentum, but it remains to be seen whether it'll be able to hold onto its players in the highly competitive live-service games market.</p><p>With its release date drawing closer, Bungie has begun to lift the lid on what it has been cooking for the last couple of years. The $40 game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-reveals-an-absolutely-stacked-voice-cast/1100-6537488/">features a stacked cast of talented voice actors</a>, details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-new-rook-shell-is-a-big-win-for-solo-players/1100-6537430/">various Runner shells</a> have been revealed, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathons-recommended-system-requirements-have-been-revealed/1100-6537487/">PC requirements for the stylish game aren't too high</a>. Sony has also shown off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-dualsense-controller-preorder-guide/1100-6537489/">limited-edition DualSense controller inspired by the game</a>, and preorders for it open soon.</p>
