			<p>Dead Take doesn’t announce itself with cheap shocks. Instead, it creeps in like a bad memory, pulling you through the corridors of an opulent mansion where every locked door feels like it’s hiding something rotten. It’s less about what jumps out at you, and more about what lingers when the screen goes black.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEAD TAKE | OUT NOW | OFFICIAL LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nx-Adkki9yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From its opening frames, Dead Take signals a different kind of horror. This is less a sprint through monsters and more a slow walk into moral quicksand. It’s a first-person, FMV-driven psychological thriller about ambition, manipulation, and the way an industry can turn people into raw material. You play Chase Lowry (Neil Newbon), an actor following the trail of his missing friend, Vinny Monroe (Ben Starr), inside the silent mansion of a powerful Hollywood producer. There’s no combat here and precious little hand-holding, just a maze of puzzles, screens, and an awful lot of things you can’t unknow once you’ve seen them.</p>


<p>The single-location setup does the heavy lifting. The house is lavish, sterile, and empty; your only contact with its owner, Duke Cain, comes as disembodied messages and the artifacts he’s left behind. The silence is suffocating, not because anything is chasing you, but because every drawer or projector you touch might peel back another layer of somebody’s performance—on screen and off it. The emptiness matters: you’re never measuring people in the room, only the versions of themselves they’ve recorded for others to see. That distance is the point, and it’s where the game’s nastiest questions live. Cain’s voice, while uncredited in-game but widely identified as creative director Abubakar Salim, adds a smug, omnipresent chill as he needles you from afar.</p>


<p>FMV can be a gimmick, but here it’s the backbone. Newbon’s Chase anchors the story with a weary, probing presence; most of his “acting” is in how you, as Chase, watch others. Starr’s Vinny is the live wire: charming on the surface, then fraying in front of the lens as opportunities curdle into coercion. Watching him unravel, in screen tests, interviews, and clipped “notes”, is more disturbing than any loud sting.</p>
<p>The supporting roster sells the conceit that this is a Hollywood ecosystem chewing people up. Jane Perry turns up as Lia Cane, icily professional and impossible to read, while Alanah Pearce’s Victoria Case is a cooler, more vulnerable counterpoint. There are also cameos from well known figure heads in the gaming industry, such as Laura Bailey, Sam Lake, and Matthew Mercer, each slotted in as faces you “know” from elsewhere, which the game smartly uses to poke at your own parasocial expectations. That extra-textual recognition isn’t a distraction; it’s the horror. Fame is a mask, and Dead Take keeps asking why we’re so eager to trust it.</p>
<p>Crucially, you’re not reading micro-tells across a dinner table; you’re parsing them through an edit suite. The most chilling moments are small—breaths held too long, a line delivered just a bit too clean, an apology that lands like a threat. You are constantly wondering if you can trust anything you see on the screen.</p>

<p>Moment to moment, this is an exploratory puzzle game. You sweep rooms for scrawled numbers, rummage through props and contracts, and, most importantly, collect USB sticks to feed the theatre’s workstation. There an AI-assisted editor lets you splice together found footage – auditions, interviews, B-roll – into “new” cuts that surface codes, unlock doors, and nudge the story forward. It’s elegantly literal: the same manipulations that shape careers and headlines are the tools you wield to progress.</p>
<p>I just wish this feature was utilised to greater effect. You are very limited to what you can actually splice, with the only correct combinations pushing the narrative forward. It would have been great if you could splice other pieces of footage together to get bonus insight into the goings on of Dead Take. Discovering the correct splices usually follows with a knocking on the theater door, which is initially scary, until the fifth time it happens where something magically appears to progress the story. It’s never explicitly explained whether something super natural is going on or if Chase has lost it. Maybe that’s the point though.</p>
<p>And yes, there are jump scares; loud, sometimes very loud. They get you early and occasionally overstay their welcome later, becoming very predictable and way less scary. The scare design is effective in the moment; the audio balance, less so.</p>

<p>Underneath the genre trappings, Dead Take is a character study about what people will trade for a shot at being seen. Vinny wants the role. Chase wants the truth. The house wants them both. The way you assemble clips to get what you need is the subtext made mechanical: stories are built, not found, and the builder always leaves fingerprints. When the game lets you sit with that, when you realize a cruel outburst or a teary confession is both “real” and carefully staged, it becomes properly unsettling.</p>
<p>The industry satire isn’t subtle. It doesn’t have to be. Power flows through gatekeepers; “notes” are weapons; NDAs feel like spells. There’s a particularly sharp sequence where a creative pitch is reduced to a brand deck, and the footage you’re splicing is less a “scene” than a negotiation over who’s allowed to exist inside it. The critique lands because the performances do. The FMV isn’t a novelty, it’s the only way to make these cuts hurt.</p>
<p>Credit to the art and sound teams for making a still, empty mansion feel predatory. The lighting carves the house into little stages – the piano room, projection suite, gallery – while long corridors amplify your doubt. The score is sparing, letting the granular foley work of keys, paper, a projector stuttering to life do the creeping. There’s restraint here. The game wants you leaning forward to hear, not flinching at every corner.</p>
<p>It’s also keenly paced for a shorter experience. I finished it in around three hours, but you can expect about four to five hours on a first run, depending on how often you get lost in the edit bay. That length feels right for the structure: long enough to build a rhythm of explore-watch-splice, short enough that the central metaphor doesn’t wear thin. If anything drags, it’s those occasional lock-and-key detours or an over-eager sting. The loop settles into a satisfying pattern: sweep a wing of the house, find a clue, sit down with the footage, and make a truth you can use.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s release is right around the corner after years of waiting, and we’ve got all the details on a physical release of the game.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 4</a>, Hollow Knight: Silksong impressed us during our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and excitement levels are through the roof with players eagerly waiting for their chance to get their hands on the game.</p>



<p>Modern gaming is now a mostly digital world, with physical releases becoming increasingly rarer, and we’ve got all the details on whether Silksong will have a physical edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-hollow-knight-silksong-have-a-physical-release">Will Hollow Knight: Silksong Have a Physical Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Waiting game. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be releasing a Physical Edition, but it won’t be available at launch on September 4. Instead, it will be released in 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Physical copies will first be available on the Nintendo Switch family of consoles in early 2026, before physical versions of the game on other platforms follow later in the year.</p>



<p>Specifics on why a physical release will come months after a digital release have not been stated, though it’s likely to be due to the small team that <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a> has. This has resulted in other changes too, including making up part of the decision <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-hollow-knight-silksong-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not to send out review copies</a> to media and content creators.</p>



<p>Pre-order details for a Physical Edition are also not available, though we should see more news in the weeks and months after the release takes place, with the focus understandably on preparing for release.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-hollow-knight-silksong-collector-s-edition">Will There be a Hollow Knight: Silksong Collector’s Edition?</h2>



<p><strong>It has not been confirmed whether Hollow Knight: Silksong will receive a Collector’s Edition, though it could be on the cards in future.</strong></p>



<p>The original Hollow Knight game received a Collector’s Edition, which featured a physical copy of the game, including all DLC, a 14-page comic book, a box case, a metal brooch, and a gold foil art print set. Inside the physical copy, there was also a manual and a fold-out map of Hallownest.</p>



<p>Players didn’t have to wait too long for the Collector’s Edition either, with Hollow Knight initially launching in February 2019, with the Collector’s Edition following in May. However, with the Physical Editions of Silksong not coming until 2026, the wait for a Collector’s Edition this time around will likely be longer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima parted ways with Konami in 2015 after spending decades as one of the top creative minds in the company. Since that time, Kojima has launched his own company and released two Death Stranding games. Okamura has openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-producer-would-love-to-work-with-hideo-kojima-on-metal-gear-solid/1100-6524582/" data-ref-id="1100-6524582">shared his admiration for Kojima</a> and expressed his desire to work with him again on MGS. However, Kojima has his own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">MGS-like game</a> called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, which may still be a few years away. The director recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/" data-ref-id="1100-6533807">Physint is still in a conceptual phase</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is out today on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Although it won't be ready at launch, Konami is adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/" data-ref-id="1100-6532384">a new online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt</a> this fall.

                <p>While players are still enjoying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Peak's brand-new Mesa biome</a>, the game's latest patch is here to address some technical concerns--specifically making it easier to run <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> on lower-powered computers.</p><p>The latest patch, which brings the game to version 1.27.a, introduces a new Texture Quality graphics setting. The new option, which Team Peak says has been much-requested, allows players with low VRAM to lower the texture quality, reducing the incidence of low framerates, missing graphics, and potential crashes. The developer notes that the lower texture quality "doesn’t even look much worse," so it's worth checking out for anyone who's been experiencing performance issues in Peak.</p><p>The developer has also added support for DX11 graphics API, alongside existing options DX12 and Vulkan. "It might be better, it might be worse," the patch notes warn, but suggest players who have had issues with the other options give it a try anyway. "We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!"</p><p>The performance-focused update has also made Peak's existing Render Scale options "more dramatic," meaning players who choose Medium or Low options should see a more obvious difference in performance.</p><p>In addition to these changes, Team Peak has added a new accessibility setting in the form of Photosensitive Mode, which dials down a number of visual effects that may impact people with photosensitivity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiNPum3mLD0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UiNPum3mLD0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new performance options make up the bulk of this update, though a few other things have been mopped up with the small patch. In absence of a true map randomizer, the dev says Mesa and Peak will now simply alternate every other day--and because Mesa will appear less often, the secret entrance in the map will now appear 50% of the time instead of 25%.</p><p>The Peak dev has also reintroduced a known issue to the game with The Kiln's lava--the patch notes say they failed to reproduce the issue in-house, so are re-enabling the rising lava in hopes of getting more reports about the bug and when it occurs.</p><p>Check out the full list of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498330460301034111" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>PEAK PATCH 1.27.a:</h2><h3>OPTIONS</h3><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS SETTING: Texture Quality  <ul><li>This is actually huge. You can now lower the texture quality across the game, which is important for players with low VRAM. This can resolve issues with low framerate, missing graphics, and even crashes. Also it doesn’t even look much worse. Check it out!</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>NEW GRAPHICS API: DX11  <ul><li>The game can now be launched in DX11 in addition to our DX12 and Vulkan options. For players who have had trouble with our previous two options, give this a try. It might be better, it might be worse. We can’t really confirm which exact configurations of graphics cards this will work better with, but if it can improve it for some of you that’s fantastic!</li></ul></li><li>Render Scale options are now more dramatic, you should see higher performance gains if you play on Medium or Low.</li><li>NEW ACCESSIBILITY SETTING: Photosensitive Mode.  <ul><li>This mode changes the following:  <ul><li>Dynamite, Flare, and Scout Cannon lit fuse effects are less flashy</li><li>Screenshake is lessened.</li><li>Bright lights from the dynamite explosion are disabled.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from taking various sources of damage are less intense and more gradual.</li><li>Fullscreen VFX from the Energy Drink, Lollipop, and Heat Pack are less intense.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>FEATURES</h3><ul><li>You can now change your sash in the Passport to any you’ve unlocked via ascents!</li></ul><h3>MAPS</h3><ul><li>The ALPINE and the MESA will now alternate every other day.</li><li>A secret entrance in the MESA is now open 50% of the time instead of 25%. Feels fair considering the MESA itself is now open 50% of the time as well.</li><li>The Lava Rises again in THE KILN. Admittedly, we didn't fix the issue with it--but since we weren't able to reproduce the issue on our end, we figured it would be helpful to put it back up and get more reports in. If the lava becomes desynced for you, please send us a video or logs!</li></ul><h3>BALANCE</h3><ul><li>Wait time until the lava rises increased by 1 minute.</li><li>The time for the lava to reach the top once it starts is increased by 3 minutes.</li></ul><h3>MINOR FIXES</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where you could pocket unpocketable items while climbing.</li><li>Replaced bees sounds in Bug Phobia Mode.</li><li>Fog walls raised in height again because apparently you could still do Cannon exploit if you did it just right.</li></ul>

                <p>After a couple of weeks of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-beta-update-brings-rival-cartel-to-drug-selling-game/1100-6533908/" data-ref-id="1100-6533908">testing on the beta branch</a>, the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1 </a>update, Rival Cartels, is now live in the main game. The update introduces competition in the form of Hyland Point's Benzies family, as well as a new property to purchase, a new vehicle, and more.</p><p>Viral hit Schedule 1 sees players build a drug-dealing empire from the ground up, and the new update adds some new obstacles for the player's rise to power--as well as new possibilities. The Benzies family will only be introduced once the player has unlocked a few customers in Westville, and once you're on their radar, they'll interfere with your business through ambushes, theft, robbing your dealers, and stealing your customers. You'll also be able to truce with the Benzies, unlocking new cartel-player deals.</p><p>Once you've completed the rival cartel's full storyline, you'll be able to purchase the new Hyland Manor property. The update also comes with a few new features, including a graffiti system that can be used to reduce the cartel's influence and gain XP. Cartel influence is something you'll have to be aware of as you progress through Schedule 1--different areas on the map will now be locked if cartel influence is too high, and players will have to reduce the influence in order to unlock new regions.</p><p>As well as the new property and mechanics, the update also adds a handful of new items and cosmetics, including the Hotbox vehicle, a pump shotgun, and some new hairstyles for you to customize the player character.</p><p>Despite its runaway success, Schedule 1 is the work of a single developer operating as Tyler's Video Game Studio, or TVGS. Tyler has apologized for recent updates taking longer than initially scheduled, and in the most recent Steam update said that he will no longer be specifying release dates for updates. The solo dev has also said that he hopes to get some office space and bring a couple of full-time developers on board for Schedule 1 soon.</p><p>Check out the rest of the patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1's latest update</a> below:</p><h2>Schedule 1 v0.4.0</h2><h3>Additions</h3><ul><li>Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point. You will first encounter them once you have unlocked a number of customers in Westville. Interactions with them include:  <ul><li>Cartel-player deals (only while truced)</li><li>Ambushes</li><li>Dealer robbings</li><li>Dead drop theft</li><li>Cartel-customer deals</li></ul></li><li>Added new purchasable property - Hyland Manor. Keep in mind that the Benzies' family storyline must be completed before this can be purchased.</li><li>Added new vehicle 'Hotbox'.</li><li>Added graffiti system. You can spray graffiti on various surfaces around the map to reduce cartel influence and gain XP.</li><li>Added spray paint item. Purchaseable at Gas Mart.

This will automatically generate a backup of your save file when you first load it on a new version of the game. This is enabled by default, and can be turned off in Settings -&gt; Other.</li><li>Added some more loading screen hints.</li><li>Added 'Urban Artist' achievement.</li><li>Added 'Finishing the Job' achievement.</li></ul><h3>Tweaks/Improvements</h3><ul><li>Changed how you unlock new regions. Each region now has a 'cartel influence' level associated with it. You must reduce this influence to a certain level before you can progress to the next region.</li><li>Stan now uses a shop interface instead of dialogue for selling weapons.</li><li>In multiplayer, you can view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs.</li><li>Deals are now cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious.</li><li>Unconscious NPCs who drop into the ocean are now killed.</li><li>Dead/unconscious NPCs can now be pickpocketed.</li><li>You can now pickpocket police.</li><li>If you attack a customer, they will not order from you for 72 hours.</li><li>Tweaks the braking properties of all vehicles.</li><li>Non-police NPCs can now use ranged weapons.</li><li>Police and NPCs in combat will now sometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.</li><li>Tweaked flashlight brightness.</li><li>Turned off JSON pretty-print for the trash save file, offering a reduction in file size.</li><li>Reduced the resell multiplier of all weapons.</li><li>You can now interrupt an incremental reload (revolver + shotgun) by clicking the LMB.</li><li>Customers now carry the cash that is required to pay for an upcoming deal.</li></ul><h3>Bug fixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li><li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li><li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li><li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li><li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li><li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm not factoring in some item quantities.</li><li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li><li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li><li>Fixed textured z-fighting on the northern waterfront.</li><li>Fixed dealer/supplier recommendation dialogue starting even if the customer was served by a dealer.</li><li>Fixed a bug where item stock limits could be ignored by using the custom amount selector.</li><li>Fixed missing colliders at the car wash.</li><li>Fixed Tobias' name misspelling.</li></ul>

                <p>Next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will introduce players to Grace Ashcroft, the newest protagonist in the franchise. In the trailers shared so far, Grace has been way over her head in danger. That's how she enters the story, but she won't remain that way forever. According to director Kōshi Nakanishi, Grace's transformation from helpless to powerful may represent the "most extreme gap" in the franchise.</p><p>"We're at the testing phase now in development as we gear up to the February release, and even as we play it internally, putting ourselves in the mindset of the players--I really feel that it's going to be an incredible rollercoaster," Nakanishi told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-requiems-director-explains-how-in-one-crucial-way-it-is-the-most-extreme-title-in-the-series-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "They're going to feel like that curve of tension to release is going to be ... it's perhaps the most extreme gap between those two axes. The points on that curve are going to be so far apart from each other that it's going to be incredible."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil 9 Requiem - Official Gamescom Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To illustrate his point without giving away spoilers, Nakanishi referred to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/" data-ref-id="1100-6534107">the unhinged creature that hunts Grace in the trailer</a>. It's the latest stalker character in the RE franchise, but Grace will have a way to deal with it even if she can't kill it.</p><p>"We're pretty tight-lipped on the details at this stage, but we want to give players a method to overcome the stalker enemy," noted Nakanishi. "What that entails is something that we'll be getting into down the line, but I think that you'll feel like you finally have a chance to turn the tables and deal with the stalker in a way that you haven't been able to in past titles."</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. It's part of Capcom's plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-gears-up-for-resident-evil-30th-anniversary-celebration-with-new-website/1100-6534067/" data-ref-id="1100-6534067">the 30th anniversary of Resident Evil</a>, most of which remain under wraps for now. Weapons director Zach Cregger is also helming the new Resident Evil movie, which is set to debut in theaters on September 18, 2026.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">post shared on LinkedIn</a>, the studio thanked those impacted by these layoffs for their "hard work, talent and passion", stating Crystal Dynamics is "committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition".</p>

            <p>
Konami has acknowledged issues with Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater, as the stealth game remake launches today.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of release, some reviews have noted disappointing performance, particularly with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> version of the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am0ER7iW2lo">Digital Foundry</a>, for instance, noted issues due to the console's PSSR upscaling, despite it overall being a beautiful game.
</p>
<p>
In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Metalgear/status/1960740185957917022">social media</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417610/METAL_GEAR_SOLID_D_SNAKE_EATER/">Steam</a>, Konami said it had "received reports of several issues and are preparing a patch to address them", though general performance is not mentioned beyond a couple of specific points causing crashes.

<p>
The known issues acknowledged by Konami are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing an additional survival knife attack after completing a series of consecutive attacks to secure food may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Removing the Crocodile Cap from the Survival Viewer while it is equipped may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Collecting food when a hungry crocodile is nearby may cause the game to crash under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Transitioning from a roll into a crawl may result in the character model floating in mid-air under certain conditions.</li>
<li>In areas where the camera switches to Intrusion View, character movement may become restricted under certain conditions.</li>
<li>Opening the Radio Window under certain conditions may cause the game to crash.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater is available now across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">Eurogamer's five star review of Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a> describes it as "a surprisingly sensitive remake from Konami" that brings a legend back to life.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-hires-former-monolith-developers/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-hires-former-monolith-developers-to-work-on-new-project.1282635/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There is little doubt that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closure of Monolith Productions</a> by Warner Bros. was one of the worst news of the year in the gaming industry, so it's great to learn that Wizards of the Coast has hired a small team of former developers led by Michael de Plater.</p>



<p>Truth be told, de Plater and his colleagues had been working more recently at Cliffhanger Games on the Black Panther game that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a few months ago by Electronic Arts</a>. Prior to that, though, they had been at Monolith Productions for a long time. de Plater himself worked on both 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and the sequel, 2017's Middle-earth: Shadow of War. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/part-of-the-team-behind-eas-cancelled-black-panther-game-joins-wizards-of-the-coast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Wizards of the Coast president John Hight said:</p>



<p><em>We're super excited to have him as part of the team. We were actually able to bring him and 14 key people that he's worked with there – and many of them at Monolith – to incubate a new game for us. He'll be starting concept development on something very cool and new – and that part I can't tell you yet. We want to give him time. We'll go through a fairly lengthy concept process where they're going to look at a lot of different ideas.</em></p>



<p>It sounds like it will take quite a lot of time before the public gets any info on the new project, but at least we know it's coming. Hight also said it's going to be a fairly similar process to that seen with Stig Asmussen's Giant Skull, although that team hit the ground running and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already making a D&amp;D  action/adventure game</a>.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has <span>been investing heavily in video games lately. About a year ago, then-president Chris Cocks (now CEO at parent company Hasbro)&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-goes-all-in-on-videogames-wants-to-ship-1-2-games-per-year-starting-late-2025-early-2026/" target="_blank">revealed</a>&nbsp;a plan to ship one or two video games each year, starting in&nbsp;</span>late 2025 or early 2026.</p>



<p>Its announced projects, be them internal or external, include <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/">a new D&amp;D game from Invoke Studios</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op D&amp;D game from Starbreeze</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-survival-life-simulation-and-action-rpg-hybrid-announced-by-gameloft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival/life simulation/action RPG in development at Gameloft</a>, the digital tabletop adventure <a href="https://wccftech.com/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-launches-in-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEMEO x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: BATTLEMARKED</a>, the aforementioned D&amp;D action/adventure game by Giant Skull, the sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exodus</a> in development at Archetype Entertainment, and a GI Joe game in the making at Atomic Arcade. Another project made at Skeleton Key was reportedly canceled earlier this year.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, renowned developer Crystal Dynamics confirmed it was forced to perform a round of layoffs. However, the new Tomb Raider game project is unaffected.</p>



<p>Here's the whole message that was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<p><em>Today, we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly. It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.</em></p>



<p><em>To those impacted - we recognize and thank you for your hard work, talent, and passion. We are committed to offering the full extent of support and resources at our disposal during this transition.</em> <em>To our teams, players, and partners, thank you for your continued support as we build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow together. This includes the future of Tomb Raider, which remains unaffected by this decision.</em></p>



<p>The studio had been collaborating with The Initiative on the Perfect Dark remake that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled</a> last month, so this could still be related to that decision taken by Microsoft.</p>



<p>Crystal Dynamics, a studio headquartered in San Mateo, California, has been in the industry for over 33 years and is known primarily for Legacy of Kain, Gex, and of course, Tomb Raider. More recently, it released Marvel's Avengers, which largely failed to gain any traction despite the IP.</p>



<p>In April 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-entry-in-development-crystal-dynamics-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the studio was working on a new installment in Lara Croft's franchise, powered by Unreal Engine 5 instead of Crystal Dynamics' proprietary Foundation Engine. A few months later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-next-game-single-player-confident-lara-amazon-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Amazon Games would publish the new title. Amazon later acquired the movie and series rights, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-is-getting-an-interconnected-universe-through-games-film-and-tv-courtesy-of-amazon/">vague goals to create an interconnected universe</a> that would also include the new games. We now know that Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been brought on to write and produce the series that will eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-series-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">air on Prime Video</a>.</p>



<p>As for the new Tomb Raider game, we last <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-and-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-will-be-shown-in-the-not-too-distant-future-says-amazon-games-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard</a> something official from Amazon Games head Christoph Hartmann, who said it wouldn't be too long before the project was shown to the public. That was in June 2024, though. Hopefully, we will get at least a trailer at the upcoming The Game Awards in December.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bethesda-mentions-next-starfield-dlc-for-the-third-time-but-still-can%E2%80%99t-confirm-details.1282614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans have all but given up waiting for the next Starfield expansion, which is <strong>long </strong>overdue for an announcement. In July, I conducted a deep dive into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-missing-expansion-bethesda-silence-unease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next Starfield DLC</a>, which has been teased by Bethesda Game Studios for more than a year but has no firm indication of what it is or when it will be released.</p>



<p>It’s in danger of shattering Todd Howard’s promise of ‘one major expansion a year for Starfield’, the 2023 space RPG that set the world ablaze for all of about two weeks.</p>



<p>In a recent developer showcase, yet another reference to the Starfield expansion was dropped, <strong>but yet again</strong>, it was mentioned that no details can be shared.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-is-starfield-s-next-expansion">Where is Starfield’s Next Expansion?</h2>



<p>Shattered Space, the first Starfield expansion that ultimately failed to move mountains, was detailed <strong>before Starfield even came out in September 2023.</strong> We knew what it looked like months before it launched in September 2024.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, almost an entire year later, and <strong>we haven’t got a clue what the next expansion will be</strong>.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has had umpteen chances to reveal the next Starfield expansion, but has neglected to do so, which suggests issues with the DLC’s development.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/_zknfAghd-s?t=303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent developer spotlight</a> with Tim Lamb, who has been with Bethesda since 2006, broke down his career. In the closing seconds of the interview, Lamb addressed the future of Starfield:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As it comes to Starfield, I’m really excited for players to see what the team has been working on.</p>



<p>We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p>



<p><strong>I can’t go into all the details just yet</strong>, but I will say that part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In June 2024, Todd Howard confirmed another expansion was in development, and in March 2025, the Bethesda team said that ‘exciting things’ are planned for this year that they can’t talk about. We’re now approaching September 2025, and <strong>we still have absolutely nothing to go on</strong> where Starfield is concerned.</p>



<p>Are you tired of waiting for the next Starfield expansion? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76%E2%80%99s-premium-subscription-is-giving-members-another-massive-advantage.1282599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout 76’s ‘premium subscription’, Fallout 1st, is set to give players another huge advantage over ‘non-paying’ users of the post-apocalyptic MMO platform. In recent years, many key perks of the plan have popped up, with Bethesda Game Studios stumping up plenty of reasons why Fallout fans should part ways with some monthly cash to secure Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the latest change to Fallout 1st, a ‘Doctor Bag Aid Box’ has popped up on the PTS (Public Test Server) in Fallout 76. This feature will enable Fallout 1st subscribers to store an unlimited number of chems in their C.A.M.P.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-chem-storage-in-fallout-76-courtesy-of-fallout-1st">Unlimited Chem Storage in Fallout 76, Courtesy of Fallout 1st</h2>



<p>When I was a non-stop fan of Fallout 76, I’d endlessly preach the benefits of Fallout 1st. For a few dollars a month, you can secure a stack of Atoms, boosters, custom server access, exclusive outfits and items, survival tents, and <strong>much more</strong>. It seems silly to have a Fallout 76 account that’s <strong>not </strong>paired with Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>The latest addition might be enough to sway more players over to the realms of Fallout 1st.</p>



<p>In the PTS, players have noticed the arrival of the Doctor Bag Aid Box, an item that has been talked about for a few weeks. In Fallout 76, the Doctor Bag Aid Box is a deployable item in your C.A.M.P. that allows you to store an unlimited number of chems, such as Stimpaks.</p>



<p>Given how Stimpaks, Super Stimpaks, Psycho, Jet, Buffout, and other chems have a fair weight requirement in Fallout 76, this is a boon for players building their character/s around using them. No longer will they take up precious stash allowances, and soon, they’ll have a dedicated space in your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p>This mimics the addition of the ammo storage unit that was thrown into Fallout 76 several months ago, and it, of course, aligns with the scrap box that Fallout 1st subscribers have been using for years.</p>



<p>Would unlimited chem storage in Fallout 76 sway you into purchasing Fallout 1st? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A new rumor suggests Valve’s next-generation Steam Deck could still be several years away. In a post on gaming forum NeoGAF, known hardware enthusiast and reliable hardware leaker <strong>KeplerL2</strong> claimed that the <strong>Steam Deck 2 is currently planned for 2028</strong>. </p>



<p>The comment, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-launch-october-16.1687405/page-5#post-270737598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">made in a discussion</a> about competing handheld PCs, offered no additional details or evidence to support the date.</p>



<p>A 2028 release date somewhat lines up with past claims of the device being “quite a while” away from happening. Valve has previously indicated that it does not plan to release a new version of the Steam Deck until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-still-says-steam-deck-2-isnt-coming-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant improvement</a> in performance and efficiency is possible. When introducing the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, Valve designer Lawrence Yang described the device as <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/valve-steam-deck-old-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the “definitive first-generation Deck”.</a> At the same time, he was said they were confident that in two or three years, there will be better technology to justify a successor to the first Steam Deck. Whether that</p>



<p>In January 2025, rumors picked up of a Steam Deck 2 utilizing AMD’s Ryzen Z2 processor. However, that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-z2-steam-deck-2-says-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly shot down</a> by Valve engineer <strong>Pierre-Loup Griffais</strong> who said that <strong>“there is (not) and will be no Z2 Steam Deck.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>For now, Valve continues to support the Steam Deck and its OLED revision, while competition in the handheld PC market intensifies from manufacturers such as ASUS and Lenovo.</p>



<p>The company has not announced any official release window for a Steam Deck 2. Even with the past reliability of the source, until anything is made official, take the claim with a grain of salt, especially when 2028 is still over two years away.</p>



<p>What do you think the Valve Steam Deck 2 will finally release? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

<p>In case you somehow missed it, Nintendo has an alarm clock that it occasionally updates with new (and free) themes.</p>
<p>In an announcement on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/f78d6765-cbb2-450a-b974-61ecbd756989">official Japanese website</a>, there'll be new sounds based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> added to Nintendo Alarmo in a future update, including seven different alarm types.</p>
<p>Here's a rough translation, which also notes how some alarms based on the new DLC will be added. When this information is shared locally, we'll provide an update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be seven new alarms , including songs from "Starry World." Please wait for further announcements regarding the release date of the alarms."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this announcement lines up with the release of the Switch 2 version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land today, along with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Star-Crossed World</a> content, which is also available to existing owners as an upgrade.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Alarmo also received free themes based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> and Super Mario. This latest Kirby-themed update follows the news of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_99">Tetris 99</a> event and an update to the Forgotten Land soundtrack on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> app.</p>

Most notably, if you scan the figure while playing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/3DS-Warioware-Gold-World-Nintendo/dp/B091KF9B3Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WarioWare Gold</a>, Wario will draw a hilariously terrible Goomba picture.</p><p>Goomba also has unique functionality in a handful of Nintendo Switch games, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N5OKGLH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Smash Bros.

Players can unlock Gold Koopa Troopa and themed stamp sheets for Bowser's Minions and the mainline story mode. Koopa Troopa is compatible with several other Mario games for 3DS. And yes, in case you were wondering, Wario is bad at drawing Koopa Troopa, too.</p><p>On Switch, Koopa Troopa functions similarly to Goomba in Smash Bros. Ultimate, Bowser's Fury, Bayonetta 2, and Super Mario Party. You'll unlock the Koopa Troopa Spirit in Smash Bros., but since a shiny Koopa sticker doesn't exist in Super Mario Party, it unlocks the Goomba sticker (if you don't already have it).</p><p>Koopa Troopa also unlocks exclusive costumes in two additional games: Conga Master Party and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Two+Super+Mario+Series+Amiibo+Return+To+Amazon+7+Years+After+Selling+Out&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+19%3A22%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+19%3A22%3A48&amp;fnarticle_id=6534324&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYoshi-s-Crafted-World-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-Edition%2F449117242%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fwhere-to-buy-super-mario-series-amiibo-koopa-troopa-goomba-amazon-restock%2F1100-6534324%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Crafted World</a>.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Goombas and Koopa Troopas have been franchise fixtures since the original Super Mario Bros. debuted in 1985 on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>In World 1-1, the first few obstacles Mario encounters are the ever-grumpy mushrooms with feet. After flattening a handful of Goombas by jumping on their heads, Mario meets the perpetually smiling tortoise for the first time. There's only one Koopa in World 1-1, but that's enough to introduce players to the more efficient method for eliminating Goombas. Over the past 40 years, Super Mario fans have hurled countless Koopa Shells at groups of Goombas.</p><p>Nintendo has iterated on Bowser's original henchmen on many occasions, but you can still count on seeing regular Koopas and Goombas in the vast majority of Super Mario Bros platformers and spin-offs. When you encounter one, there's a good chance the other is nearby, so it's only fitting that Amazon has both of these Amiibo in stock at the same time.</p><hr><h2><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F5HYD1FD,B0F5HYKP6J,B0F5HXWKP6,B0F5HZ6KL9,B0F5HYSVS1,B0F5HZ11D8,B0F5HWX7XC,B0FDM8FQSJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo at Amazon</a></strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558220" data-ratio="0.48181818181818" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4558220"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4558220-nintendoswitch2amiibostoryamazon.png"></figure><p>Amazon has seven of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F5HYD1FD,B0F5HYKP6J,B0F5HXWKP6,B0F5HZ6KL9,B0F5HYSVS1,B0F5HZ11D8,B0F5HWX7XC,B0FDM8FQSJ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eight Nintendo Switch 2 Amiibo figures</a> in stock, and four characters are on sale for $20 each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Storied development studio Crystal Dynamics, famous for their work on everything from <em>Tomb Raider </em>to <em>Marvel's Avengers </em>to <em>Gex</em>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> earlier today that as a "result of evolving business conditions", they had "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues".</p><p>Those conditions are numerous; there's an overall downturn in the video game market, particularly at the AAA end that Crystal Dynamics operate, in which it feels like more projects are being cancelled and studios closed then games are being released to buy and play.</p><p>But then there are problems cruelly unique to Crystal Dynamics, a studio with an exceptional track record who have nevertheless over the years found themselves bought by a large publisher (Square Enix) that had absolutely no idea what to do with them,<a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> before more recently being offloaded to a company (Embracer) with even <em>less</em> idea</a>, and which has in no small part contributed to the dire state of the AAA market I mentioned above.</p><p>The company's full statement reads:</p><blockquote><div><p>Today we made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of our talented colleagues as the result of evolving business conditions. This decision was not made lightly.

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4853f9b8731ad/final-fantasy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following some reports about the performance and visual presentation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on the Switch 2, Square Enix has now officially confirmed the title's frame rate.</p>
<p>Switch 2 users can expect this upcoming release to run at a "stable 30 frames per second" while also offering "smooth performance" as well as some slick visuals. Here's the company's <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1960711660592873862">official update about this via its social channels</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Square Enix:</strong> "Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we don't have official specs detailing other aspects of the Switch 2 release just yet, Digital Foundry's John Linneman <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/the-best-looking-thing-ive-seen-on-switch-2-digital-foundry-talks-final-fantasy-7-remake">recently gave this version high praise</a>, calling it the "best-looking thing" he's seen on the Switch 2 so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>I'm gonna say right now, this is the best-looking thing I've seen on Switch 2. Seeing that game running at a stable 30fps, with that excellent motion blur especially, it looked fantastic. It was completely stable, it looked on par – actually I would say it looks better than the PS4 version, at a glance.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo Life video producer Felix Sanchez went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-weve-played-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-on-switch-2">hands on with this title at Gamescom</a>, so if you want to find out more about how the Switch 2 version holds up, check out our previous story.

            <title><![CDATA[Screamer Hands-On Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/screamer-hands-on-preview.1282551/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like all-you-can-eat Pizza Huts, reasonably-priced concert tickets, and The Secret World of Alex Mack, Screamer is something I enjoyed in the 1990s but essentially disappeared from our lives decades ago. The original Screamer, released in 1995, was one of a trio of games developed by Italian studio Graffiti before it quickly rebranded itself as Milestone a year later. An over-the-top arcade racing game exclusively for PC, it arrived rapidly in the slipstream of pioneering 3D racers like The Need for Speed, Ridge Racer, and Destruction Derby (and was followed by a sequel and two one-and-done spin-offs) but has faded into relative obscurity since. However, over a quarter of a century since Milestone’s final Screamer game, the series is howling back to the track with a wild new look and an interestingly nuanced suite of controls and power-ups that shake up the slamming, the shifting, and even the steering. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to game director Federico Cardini, Screamer is a game Milestone has long wanted to resurrect, but you should know that it’s more the <em>name </em>that’s being brought back here. That is, aside from the title there really isn’t anything immediately significant in the new Screamer that meaningfully reminds me of the original. Dramatic changes of identity are usually kryptonite for sequels and reboots – especially belated ones – but I actually don’t think it’s a problem in Screamer’s case. The original was an impressive game for its time, but it was admittedly otherwise largely typical of arcade racing games in that era. The new one is a bit of a different story.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t describe Screamer in a single sentence the way you can with a lot of arcade racing games. A good deal of arcade racers generally allow you to count the number of pertinent instructions on your nipples. That is, there are only two: accelerate and steer. After an hour of hands-on driving and drifting with Screamer it’s clear there’s a lot more to it than this, and it’s this depth that makes it quite fascinating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer is a twin-stick racing game, and it instantly reminds me of 2020’s Inertial Drift in this sense. While the left stick is used for conventional steering, the right stick is used to add drift angle. In simple terms, the left stick controls the front of the car, and the right stick basically controls the rear. It’s easier to grasp than it perhaps sounds, but it does require a certain deftness on both sticks to make the necessary adjustments to your angle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It goes much further than this, however, as Screamer also packs a potent range of power-ups that are extracted from two separate gauges that fill based on certain actions. Inspired by fighting games, Screamer calls this its ‘Echo’ system – where using one side of the gauge affects the other side. There’s a shotgun spray of bespoke, in-game terminology that you’ll encounter if and when you play Screamer yourself, but I’m going to avoid most of that here because I think it’ll only serve to make Screamer sound a little impenetrable. On track – and in the thick of it – it’s all fairly intuitive, so I’ll try to describe it as such.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Screamer - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially, the left side of the gauge will fill throughout a race both passively and via certain actions – like perfectly-timed shifts. Screamer’s vehicles have semi-automatic transmissions, so they’ll shift automatically if you’re overwhelmed (or you forget), but if you nail your upshifts you’ll fill the left gauge faster. It’s not a remotely racing related comparison, but it reminded me of Gears of War’s active reload system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The left gauge is used to provide both boosts and shields against attacking opponents. Even boosts are handled differently, with a press–hold-and-release mechanic that you need to time by using an onscreen icon. Get the release spot-on and you will earn a longer and more effective boost than standard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the gauge on the right? Well, you fill the gauge on the right by <em>using </em>the power-ups afforded by the gauge on the left. The gauge on the right allows you to use the offensive abilities Screamer has dubbed ‘strike’ and ‘overdrive.’ ‘Strike’ is a temporary boost in speed during which any other car you smash into will explode, and ‘Overdrive’ is an indefinite boost that lasts until you crash. Overdrive is pretty tough to use on the twistiest portions of the tracks; after a certain amount of time locked in Overdrive you’ll reach a critical state where even a brush off a wall will see you blow up. It is extremely quick, though, and it’s a power-up I observed the AI was always willing to deploy at every opportunity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the 1995 original, Screamer features a roster of unlicensed cars. However, while the original game’s cars were clearly just de-badged versions of iconic ’90s sports cars and exotics with otherwise generic names, the cars in the upcoming Screamer are wild, anime-inspired vehicles covered in aggressive, time attack-style aero. The anime inspiration extends beyond the cars, too; indeed, Milestone has partnered with Japanese animation studio Polygon Pictures for Screamer’s story. We weren’t privy to any of these cutscenes during our preview, but I did get to race as a variety of different characters – each of whom have different abilities that alter how they fill their power gauge, and how their cars handle. There’s a really significant difference in car feel across characters so, even though the handling is quite easy to pick up, it’s not one-note.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Milestone achieved the improbable in 2021 with Hot Wheels Unleashed, creating a gorgeous and highly approachable arcade racing banger that far exceeded any expectations one might have had of a game based on a licensed toy. It’s a very different sort of racing experience to the Hot Wheels Unleashed series but, after my hour with it, I’m not expecting Screamer to quietly come and go when it arrives in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

Either way, Sony says these bundles will only be available in limited quantities, so if you’re looking to grab one, you’ll want to be ready for when preorders open.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click">PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro Console Covers -

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to believe it's been four years since I first set sail and fell in love with Valheim. As a fan of survival crafting and all things Norse, it's one of the best experiences out there in both regards. And while it still feels fairly familiar at the outset – and somehow it’s still calling itself “early access,” whatever that means anymore – it's gotten a mountain of patches since launch, with a list of changes that would take longer to read than the rambling tangent about some side character's great-grandfather in a viking saga. From new biomes and new bosses to crafting and combat improvements, the version of Valheim you can download today cuts like a blade that developer Iron Gate has been sharpening winter in and winter out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that still holds true today, except that the world has gotten much bigger and just about every system has been improved on in some small or large way. Except greydwarves. They're still annoying as hell. But we'll get to that.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Good news for melee builds</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This revisit is based on the opt-in beta patch announced at Gamescom 2025, known as the Call to Arms update, and that’s fitting because it's brought some of the most significant changes to combat yet. Trinkets are a new equipment slot that lets you build up adrenaline by skirmishing – basically a super meter if you're familiar with fighting games – with different effects at full adrenaline for different trinkets. They've also added a "perfect dodge" that makes it possible to run a melee build without a shield, as long as you're good at timing enemy attacks. And perfect blocks no longer cost stamina, which makes that build way more viable too. Finally, the reign of the stealth archer may be coming to an end! Well, probably not entirely, but at least it won't be so far ahead of other playstyles. Just like nearly everything else that's changed in Valheim over the years, combat is the same system that's always been here but just a bit better and deeper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We finally get (killed by) bears!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The mascot for this patch, though, is the lumbering bear enemy. Why did it take this long to put a bear in the viking survival game? I don't know, but I'm glad she's here now. Sitting somewhere between greydwarves and trolls in terms of difficulty, bears add some much-needed enemy variety to the early areas where most people end up spending a majority of their time anyway. And collecting bear parts lets you build a new weapon and armor set that really lean into the super-aggressive melee playstyle. I'm worried that these items will be completely underpowered in the mid-late game, but it's nice for the first leg of your adventure to be able to go full berserker.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Journeying through mist and flame adds mythological flair</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In the bigger picture, Valheim has become a much more complete saga since I originally reviewed it. Two additional biomes, the foggy Mistlands and burning Ashlands, have been added along with their attendant bosses, but I haven't been able to check the latter out yet on this fresh save I made for the patch where I'm about 25 hours in. As a matter of fact, even with well over 100 hours in Valheim overall across multiple playthroughs, I've still never seen the Ashlands – added just last year – at all, actually. The world is huge! And that's very exciting. There's still a bit left to go on the roadmap, with one major boss and one biome still missing, but it's much closer to the finish line than it is to the start. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Survival Crafting Games</h3><p>I've reviewed a lot of these! Here are my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even in my initial Early Access outing, I said I could barely tell this is an Early Access game, and that's only become more and more true. The amount that's already here could take you months to chew through playing off and on like I do. The final 1.0 release might be out already by the time you finish the Ashlands if you start today. The sheer amount of time it would take to even run into a proverbial Under Construction sign puts them out of reach of what most of my playthroughs have even come close to accomplishing. And I have to ask: if it takes 60-plus hours for me to even notice something isn't finished, is it really unfinished at all? Or am I just waiting for an expansion to come out? It kind of feels more like the latter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Swamps are still a bummer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Every new area has fresh enemies, unique survival challenges, new recipes to discover, and a strong theme. Higher-level biomes pull in more mythological elements that really remind you you're not in Kristiansand anymore. Moving from the Black Forest into the Swamps is still a rough transition with how much more unforgiving the terrain, enemies, and status effects become – right at the same time that travel distances are becoming an issue, and before you can unlock portals. It's no surprise to me that that's where a lot of my runs have ended. Plus, who likes a stinky poison swamp anyway? It's definitely my least favorite biome, even in the latest patch. But it's worth getting through to see what comes after it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Greydwarves are still annoying as hell</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Greydwarves in the Dark Forest remain annoying little pests that come to bother you all the time and present very little combat challenge. If we could craft a trinket that scares away lower-level enemies, I think that would be great. Remember the Morrowind mod that added a belt that would zap cliff racers out of the air? Are Valheim players too young to remember Morrowind? You know what, don't even answer that. I don't want to know.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Survival Games</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Mining feels less grindy, but maybe that's just character development on my part</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Gear progression feels a lot less grindy now as well. I haven't compared the numbers to see how much of that is actual changes to ore drop rates and carry weights and how much it's just that I've gotten used to how time-consuming it is. I no longer feel like I'm spending hours and hours teching up from stone to bronze. And while I was initially annoyed by the lack of realism in the fact that repairing items doesn't cost crafting mats… I have to admit I was wrong. It's a great little quality-of-life feature that I don't have to go hunt down extremely rare materials to keep my best gear nice and shiny. It’s good to know that once I craft something, it's mine forever.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The building system could still use some work</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Building is one area where I think other survival crafting games have kind of left Valheim behind, mainly in terms of how fiddly it can get. I know part of this is that it's meant to be fairly realistic, and I respect that. But the variety of structural building pieces, especially early on, is still kind of disappointing. And it remains a massive pain to work on rooftops or anything high up due to how stairs, ladders, and slopes behave. As unrealistic as it is, I find myself wishing for something as simple as Minecraft scaffolding, which lets you ascend up to whatever height you need just by holding jump. I know we can't have Dune: Awakening-style hovering in fantasy Scandinavia. Maybe I could send a raven up there to help me place stuff? Just some ideas.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>One of the best survival crafting games ever has only gotten better</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I adored Valheim when it was roughly half the adventure it is now. The world has gotten so much richer and the progression so much deeper in the four years since, while even mechanics I was interacting with on my first day of a new playthrough have improved in small and subtle ways. If it doesn't lead the pack for the whole genre outright, it's at least very close to the front, howling gleefully as its charming, low-res 3D art style beckons me into calm meadows and foreboding dungeons. I haven't ever really stopped playing it for more than a handful of months at a time since it launched in early access, and the idea of starting a new world always gets me excited even if I know the first few verses of the saga by heart at this point.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/valheim-review-update-2025-call-to-arms]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Every time Hello Games is readying an update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, studio founder Sean Murray tweets out cryptic emoji that send the community's head spinning. For the <a href="http://nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Voyagers update</a>, he posted a waving emoji, followed by a group of three waving emoji to hint at the major feature of the update: ships big enough to travel around in with your friends.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZLz1MW0aE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Voyagers update brings Corvette-class ships to the galaxy. Where the one-seater ships we've piloted thus far are pretty limited in customization, you'll build your Corvette "piece by piece" with full customization, meaning that your ship will be truly unique. You'll be able to customize both the inside and outside, designing the ship through a ship-designer menu that doesn't seem that different from Starfield's version. The update even includes different interior styles and cockpits, so that you can make your ship feel like the Millennium Falcon, filled with readouts and switches, or go for something more streamlined like Star Trek. There are a bunch of working ship modules that will enhance the functionality and stats of your ship, too, so this isn't purely cosmetic.</p><p>Once built, you can get out of your chair and walk around the inside. If you hop on with friends, you can travel the galaxy together, all in one ship.</p><p>There's even a new spacewalking mechanic to let you step out the airlock of your Corvette, to float around in space or jump from your Corvette to your friend's.</p><p>The update also adds graphical enhancements to glass, to player lighting, and more, along with DLSS 4 compatibility.</p><p>And of course, Hello Games also saw fit to add an Expedition to the game to speed up initial ship building.</p><h2>No Man's Sky Voyagers Update Patch Notes</h2><h3>Corvette-class Starships</h3><ul><li>Added a new class of starship, the Corvette. Corvettes are large, fully bespoke ships with furnished interiors, capable of accommodating multiple passengers.</li><li>A lightweight tutorial for assembling your first Corvette will activate upon first collecting a Corvette module or interacting with the Corvette Workshop.</li><li>A large catalogue of snappable structural and decorative modules is available for Corvette assembly, including habitation modules, hulls, wings, engines, windows, accessways, weapons, reactors, shield generators, connectors and decorative peripherals.</li><li>Corvette modules can be unearthed from salvage containers buried on worlds across the universe, as well as discovered in Derelict Freighters.</li><li>Modules can also sometimes be retrieved from defeated pirates, freighter cargo pods, crashed freighter crates, frigate expeditions, or received as rewards for completing missions.</li><li>Structural Corvette modules are collected individually in the inventory and spent directly when assembling a Corvette.</li><li>While standing within a Corvette, specialised furnishings and a selection of base decorations can be installed in the ship's interior. Internal modules can be installed without limitation, but require resources to construct.</li><li>Habitation modules ("habs") form the main living area for Corvette-class starships. Habs are available in three distinct classes: Titan, Thunderbird, and Ambassador, each with its own sci-fi aesthetic.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Victory Royale. </h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We all know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-10-will-feature-gorillaz-starting-tomorrow">Fortnite is the king of crossovers</a>, but the tables have turned in recent years, with Fortnite crossing over into LEGO territory. We've had a handful of sets come out that represent the weird and whacky world of one of the most popular battle royale games, like the Durrr Burger and iconic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-fortnite-battle-bus-a-digital-to-physical-triumph">Battle Bus</a>. The most recent set, which dropped earlier this month, is the gigantic Mecha Team Leader. I'm not the biggest Fortnite player, but even I can't deny how much fun this build was. </p><div catalogid="b1c6547c-25f1-4150-8779-f8bb2aa193e5" id="227362"><div id="227362" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader is easily the biggest build <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-batman-forever-batmobile-set-76304">I've done here on IGN</a>. When the box arrived in the mail I was genuinely surprised at its size. Coming in at just under two feet, the box is absolutely massive. The set itself is comprised of 2,503 pieces and is spread out among 19 bags. The instruction booklet is just as heavy-duty, feeling like a graphic novel at 317 pages. The instructions and sticker sets even came in a premium-feeling envelope to protect it, which I appreciated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I started this build. I've built countless LEGO sets in my day, but truly nothing quite at this scale. I built this in one day because I don't know how to relax, with a couple breaks in between because my kitchen table chairs aren't comfy whatsoever. Overall, I think it took me around five or six hours. Every aspect of the mech's body is exquisitely detailed, each with their own extremely technical and unique attachment techniques. I timed it, and just one leg took me almost an hour.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm not educated on the lore behind the Mecha Team Leader's design, but I think I can speak for everyone when I comment on how ridiculous (and ridiculously awesome) this set is. One leg is made up of what looks like ice cream, with an apple foot, while the other foot is a literal cheeseburger. I don't get it, and I don't care; this thing rules. Building the each body part was extremely satisfying, getting to see how in-depth the attachment techniques are. Every limb is movable and posable except for the knees, which unfortunately don't bend. But you can still articulate the mech's arms, hands, and fingers to put it up on your shelf however you want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorite aspects of this build is the huge sword. It cleverly uses a grey LEGO minifigure blank head and ponytail hairstyle to simulate what I'm pretty sure is a fabric tassel on the end of the sword's grip. You can slot the sword into either of the mech's hands, so feel free to pose it however you want, the sword won't fall off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mech's chest cavity opens up to allow a minifigure version of it to enter, and this is also one of the first parts of the build. You build out the pilot cockpit, complete with a detailed chair and screens to survey the battlefield, which are where most of the sticker elements come into play. The mech's armor breastplate itself was fun to build, but I'm questioning some of the sequencing in the steps here; it was difficult to attach the upper breastplate once it was fully assembled to the rest of the body without breaking off other pieces in the process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teddy bear head really ties the whole set together. It's the last bit of the build, and it also one of my favorite parts. I always appreciate how LEGO designers can take ordinary brick shapes and mold into an extremely detailed, uncanny recreation of what we all know to be a head, and the Mecha Team Leader's head is no different. Its eyes, ears, and little tufts of hair sticking out are awesome little details. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though I don't play Fortnite, the LEGO Mecha Team Leader is one of my favorite builds I've ever done, whether for IGN or on my own. Once it's all said and done, it stands at almost 18 inches tall. It's an impressively designed and time-consuming build that I highly recommend spacing out over multiple sessions. The minifigure version of the mech, the buildable sword, and "Fortnite" printed LEGO plaque are all great additions to an already great set. I love LEGO and I'm a huge nerd when it comes to appreciating the design of massive, technical sets like this, and I can't wait to see more of what they can cook up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, a trailer leaked for a cancelled multiplayer<a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-pc-port-august-2022-ps4-ps5-steam-sony-plays-1849011465"><em> Spider-Man</em> game</a> that was being developed by Insomniac. It seemed cool. So cool in fact, that it seems to have inspired folks to try and use mods to make online web-swinging with friends a reality. And one such mod is now out, and it looks great.</p> <p>On August 26, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/marvels-spider-man-co-op-multiplayer-mod-pc/">as spotted by <em>ComicBook</em></a>, a new PC-only mod has been released online that allows people to play Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> with up to six other players. The mod was developed by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/hbgda">modder hbgda and is available to those who subscribe to the creator’s Patreon</a>. You can see what the mod looks like in action below, courtesy of a video shared by popular creator Kami on TikTok and Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Spider-Man Remastered just got a working multiplayer mod on PC and it's amazing.</p> <p>Probably the closest thing we're going to get to The Great Web. <a href="https://t.co/6FeT3JEBbz">pic.twitter.com/6FeT3JEBbz</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1960452836887568680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/VqjYrZ2WvCM"> There are also multiple YouTube videos of the multiplayer <em>Spider-Man</em> mod in action</a>, and it looks surprisingly stable for something as ambitious and wild as this. Sure, it’s not perfect, but considering<em> Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> on PC was never designed to support multiplayer, let alone seven people running and swinging around the map at the same time, the fact that this mod is not only playable but looks extremely polished is incredibly impressive.</p>

 <p>Watching footage of hbgda’s mod in action has me hankering to install <em>Spider-Man</em> on my PC and try this out. It also makes me sad that we never got Insomniac’s online multiplayer Spider-Man game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-the-great-web-online-co-op-game-trailer-1851329786">It was reportedly going to be called <em>Spider-Man: The Great Web</em></a> and would have involved hopping between dimensions alongside your friends. Sadly, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-12-22/playstation-employees-at-insomniac-studio-fear-identity-theft-after-massive-hack">according to <em>Bloomberg’s</em> Jason Schreier</a>, the game was canceled long before the trailer for it leaked in 2024 in the wake of the December 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">Insomniac data breach.</a></p> <p>While it’s very possible the game wouldn’t have had much staying power, which is a problem for a live-service video game, I would have loved to have been able to invite my pals to swing around NYC with me and cause some chaos. At the very least, I hope we see Insomniac add a multiplayer mode to a future Spider-Man game. Doesn’t have to be something elaborate, just something that looks like this mod, but which is playable on PS5, too.</p> <p>For now, if you want to swing around New York City as Spider-Man with some other Spider-People, your only option is to download this mod and set it up on your PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/september%E2%80%99s-2025-ps-plus-games-include-psychonauts-2.1282461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of the month again where we get to look ahead to another batch of bundled games with PlayStation Plus. Sony has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games for September 2025 and it would be fair to say they are underwhelming.</p>
<p><span>What are the PS Plus September 2025 Monthly Games?</span></p>


<p>It’s quirky indie month on PS Plus and these games will be available from Tuesday, 2nd September :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Viewfinder&nbsp;</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong> | PS4</li>
<li><strong>Psychonauts 2&nbsp;</strong> | PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>So who had to Google “Viewfinder PS5”, because I did. This is the first time the game has been written about on TSA, even though it was released in July 2023 on PS5 and PC, PS4 the following December, then on Xbox Series X|S this month, and Switch later this year. So what is the game about?</p>

<p><em>“Use an instant camera to challenge perception, redefine reality and reshape the world. View the world through a new lens in this charming and unique first-person puzzle adventure. Reshape a wealth of stunning environments through your instant camera’s viewfinder in order to solve a variety of mind-bending puzzles. Bring photos, paintings, sketches and postcards to life as you reshape reality and slowly uncover the surprising mysteries that lie behind this colourful world.”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Viewfinder - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_lIQ2EZRH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up is Stardew Valley which originally launched in 2016 on PC and came to PS4 eight years ago. I seem to remember the PS Vita version was on PS Plus at some point. Does anyone really need to be told what Stardew Valley is about? You do, at the back? Really? Have you been living under a rock for the last ten years?</p>
<p><em>“You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!”</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Stardew Valley - Gameplay Trailer | PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8A7A1X1TVNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And finally we have the excellent Psychonauts 2 which was released on Xbox back in 2021 with the PS4 version arriving in 2023. Rather than explain what the game is about, why not watch our handy video review! Spoiler: <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">It’s great we gave it 9/10</a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Psychonauts 2 Review (Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1u6JKe9j3Yo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>Can you still get the August 2025 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>Yes! You’ve got until Monday 1st September to claim your PS Plus games, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lies of P</strong> | PS5, PS4</li>
<li><strong>DayZ</strong> | PS4</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/august-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-include-lies-of-p/">Head here for the full skinny </a>on that.</p>
