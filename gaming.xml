Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Danny DeVito has been asked whether he'd take on the role of Wario in a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, after having been suggested for the role by Luigi voice actor Charlie Day and Mario performer Chris Pratt.
</p>
<p>
Day, who co-stars with DeVito in Always Sunny in Philadelphia, previously told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXv_9pg3SM">Digital Spy</a> he wanted the actor to take on the role of Mario's moustache-twirling, nose-picking nemesis in a future film. 
</p>
<p>
Now, DeVito has been asked whether he'd accept the offer and, seemingly unwittingly, has replied with the perfect money-grabbing Wario response.

<p>
"I'm going to take them to the cleaners," DeVito told YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAn3Q61q8Io">TheMovieDweeb</a> - which sounds pretty similar to something the loot-loving Wario would say. "But I should be in the movie."
</p>
<p>
"You never know what happens in the world," DeVito said when asked about taking on the Wario role in future. "I'm up for a lot of things. I'm up for - I'm ready to do a lot of things. Whatever's coming, I look at, I see, I evaluate."
</p>
<p>
Will we see Wario make his big screen debut in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-super-mario-bros-movie-will-release-in-2026">next Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, set to arrive in cinemas in 2026? </p>
<p>Nintendo is, so far, keeping the plot and main characters of the next Mario movie under-wraps, though we've already donned our plumber's thinking cap and overalls to speculate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-where-the-mario-movie-series-may-go-next">where the Super Mario Bros. series might go next</a>.

            <p>Absurd Ventures, the company started by Rockstar Games co-founder and head writer Dan Houser after he left said juggernaut, are working on a new "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" game. That's according to recent job listings on Absurd's website (cheers <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/rockstar-co-founder-and-former-gta-lead-dan-houser-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game-of-his-own-at-his-new-studio/">Gamesradar</a> for the spot), which mention such a thing. And to be honest, are any of us surprised? Not really. Will the finished product resemble GTA to some degree? I imagine yes. Am I happy about this? Yeah, go on then.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Last year, Absurd Ventures <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-and-gta-writer-dan-houser-founds-new-company-absurd-ventures">said</a> they'd, "create a new IP across all platforms and for all formats", with a focus on storytelling. On top of that, they said they'd produce "narrative worlds" in the form of other things like books, graphic novels, and podcasts.</p>
<p>Later, a couple of those worlds would be <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1729909061683155364">unveiled</a> as American Caper and A Better Paradise, American Caper being a graphic novel and A Better Paradise an audio drama, but both likely to spin off into other forms in the future.</p>
<p>All of this is to say, Absurd Ventures now have a bunch of roles going on their <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007">site</a> and some of them give a glimpse into the game they're working on. The Lead Gameplay Designer vacancy mentions an open world action-adventure game, but also someone to help develop "best-in-class combat" and "third person action across multiple game modes". There's also mention in this listing of someone with knowledge of "melee and shooting mechanics", as well as "driving, mounts, climbing, traversal, platforming, etc."</p>
<p>A look at some of the other roles on offer, like Senior Art Director, don't really give anything away. It's the usual spiel of delivering on a "creative vision" and "aligning with the game's design and narrative goals". Yeah, uhuh, cool.</p>
<p>So what can we surmise from all of this? Absurd Ventures are working on a game that sounds quite like GTA. But if their latest <a href="https://x.com/AbsurdVentures/status/1790448666844754190">Xweet</a> is any indication of the vibe they're setting, I'd imagine it's going to be edgy alright.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/japanese-switch-online-players-just-got-an-important-piece-of-zelda-history.872598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/24157710/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-links-awakening-the-frog-for-whom-the-bell-tolls<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YTeolB">While here in the US the Nintendo Switch Online service got <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157336/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-update-super-mario-land">three new Mario games this week</a> (yes, <em>Alleyway </em>is a Mario game), the update for Japan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4czuDKwgc8">included a bonus classic</a> you may not have heard of. <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em> (officially translated as <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>) was a Japanese Game Boy release, co-developed by the familiar tag-team of Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Intelligent Systems, responsible for much of the Game Boy’s lineup. And while <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>may not be a household name, if you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23609051/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-nintendo-switch-online-ending"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em></a> (and who isn’t?) you should take the time to play it.</p>
<p id="VfJMLS">“<em>Link’s Awakening</em>’s development story is retold time and time again, but what’s almost always left out is that it’s built directly on top of [...] <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em>,” Nintendo Life’s Jon Cartwright details in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaOhJbSufJI">this excellent video</a>. That is really apparent when you see the game in motion. From the engine to the font to the transition from top-down to side-scrolling, <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls </em>should look familiar.</p>
<p id="9wYiKi">Something else should look familiar to those of you who have played <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. Prince Richard, the weird guy with the frogs living in Pothole Field, who asks you to help him find his five Golden Leaves? That character is actually from <em>The Frog For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, and even the music that plays in his villa is a variation on that game’s theme. Here’s a description from Marc Normandin’s fun <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">RetroXP newsletter</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="TLLzVC">Prince Richard is actually not the protagonist of For the Frog the Bell Tolls, but is instead the best friend of him. The protagonist is the Prince of Sable, named and controlled by you. The adventure begins with the two princes (oh no) finding out that a princess is in trouble and must be saved, leading to the two trying to race the other to the finish line.</p></blockquote>

</p></div>
<p id="hrEv6R">Another familiar face for the Smash Bros. fans out there is the aforementioned Prince Sable, who shows up as an Assist Trophy, using his frog and snake powers. Oh right, about those, again <a href="https://retroxp.substack.com/p/its-new-to-me-for-the-frog-the-bell">from Normandin</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="OpsBjG">Prince Sable can transform into a frog or a snake, and eventually, can do so basically at will. A witch turns Prince Richard and his men — who arrived to save Princess Tiramisu from Delarin first — into frogs, and then later on, turns the Prince of Sable into a frog as well.</p></blockquote>

<p id="bYvilN">If you don’t live in Japan or don’t read Japanese, don’t worry! An <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/1623/">English fan translation</a> was created in 2011, which can be applied to a copy of the ROM . (Or, if you prefer, <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/translations/6517/">here is an updated version</a> that changes the title from <em>For the Frog the Bell Tolls</em> to Nintendo’s now “official” translation <em>The Frog for Whom the Bell Tolls</em>.) As far as how to apply patches to ROM files, or how to dump a cartridge to obtain a ROM file, I will leave that up to you and your ability to search the internet. From there, you just need to find a suitable emulator — and these days <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150467/delta-emulator-apple-app-voice-notes-ai-vergecast">even iPhones</a> are in on the game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-outlines-skull-and-bones-season-2-after-tremendous-response-to-the-game-since-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> Season 2 is on the way after what Ubisoft called a “tremendous response” from the game’s community.</p><p>Skull and Bones launched in February on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, anbd PC (but not on Steam) after years of delays and was thought to have suffered from low player numbers. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skull-and-bones-review">Skull and Bones review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Skull and Bones is a maritime RPG with a strong foundation, even if it feels like a live-service first draft.”</p><p>Season 1 soon followed, and now Ubisoft has confirmed what to expect from Season 2. “Let us begin by saying how amazing it has been for all of us working on Skull and Bones to witness the tremendous response from our entire community since the launch of our game,” Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/4JskVoFQcIbc50OENc1JxT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post.</a>. "From the ways our players engage with our game and content, to the ton of screenshots, videos and livestreams shared across social media, Discord and Reddit."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Skull and Bones - The Complete Timeline</h3></div></output><p>“It is thanks to your incredible engagement, that we were able, throughout Season 1, to observe, listen, understand, and more importantly react to your feedback on a weekly basis," Ubisoft continued. "Our commitment continues to remain the same - to create and update our game together, with our community. This wouldn't have been possible without the passion and dedication you've shown to Skull and Bones.”</p><p>During its most recent financial report, Ubisoft failed to say how many copies Skull and Bones sold since going on sale at full price on February 16. But it did say the game saw “strong engagement”, with the second-best daily playtime for a Ubisoft game. That included an average of four hours in the first weeks following launch. Ubisoft put this down to end-game content that launched with Season 1.</p><p>“We target to further improve this retention and enlarge the player base with the upcoming launch of Season 2, Chorus of Havoc, that will continue to enrich the end-game with the addition of new bosses, world events and ship upgrades,” Ubisoft added. “Season 2 will also bring new PvE &amp; Solo game modes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ubisoft has committed to at least one full year of content for Skull and Bones, divided up into four seasons. It will be interesting to see if the game gets a second year of support.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-115926-1715857180291.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ubisoft further detailed Season 2 in the blog post. Here are the notes:</p><h2>Skull and Bones Season 2 key features and improvements preview</h2><p>With Season 2, we're bringing many improvements to our end game loop, adjustments to our seasonal formula and a ton of new content which we believe will address some key concerns from the community.</p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Ship Upgrades, which will allow you to upgrade your ships to improve ship stats and gain new perks.</li><li>Fleet Management, which will allow you to assign ships to manufactories to automatically collect pieces of eight.</li><li>Helm Leases, which will allow you to acquire a manufactory of your choice.</li><li>New PvE &amp; Solo Game Modes</li><li>Balancing the costs of our Manufactories</li></ol><p>These changes come in addition to the new content (new boss fight, new sea monster, new ship, weapons, armors and furniture) that will be introduced and communicated to you through additional dev updates and devblogs, in the upcoming days/weeks on Discord, Reddit, Social Media and our website.</p><h3>Seasonal reset</h3><p>With Season 2 right around the corner, many of you have been eager to find out what exactly is going to change when Season 1 ends.</p><h3>Rewarding your achievements and preparing for season 2</h3><p>Our seasonal model on Skull and Bones is designed around the idea that players fight against seasonal antagonists, Sea Monsters and other Ghost Ships to protect The Helm's smuggling activities and grow both their profit and influence in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Each new season in Skull and Bones sees the arrival of a new threat, coming to disrupt and force the Helm and its associates to adapt the way they operate and manage their trading network.</p><p>With Season 1, we deliberately took the time we needed to carefully monitor and understand your feedback and the way you engage with our game content. The learnings we gathered throughout the season helped us make the necessary adjustments and balancing to our end game economy, features, and systems. Now that Season 2 is coming, we can share more details on the full list of rewards that will be handed out to the most successful Kingpins from Season 1.</p><p>The first thing we announced during a previous livestream of The Deck was that everyone who reached the Diamond Rank on the leaderboards by the end of Season 1, would receive the cosmetic set at the beginning of Season 2.</p><p>In addition, we will also be rewarding those of you who successfully and significantly grew their empire, with some of the new items coming with our Season 2 update: World Helm Leases and Ship Upgrade Parts. These two items will become key in growing your fleet of ships, acquiring the manufactories of your choice, and get a head start in shaping your empire to your strategy.</p><p>As stated above, with the end of each season, and the arrival of a new antagonist, comes significant disruption to The Helm and their smuggling operations. As a result, all players will see their ranks on the leaderboards, their manufactories, and upgrades be reset. Not all is lost however, as your efforts have been recognised by The Helm's representative, who will trust you with new tools to re-build your empire and prove your worth as a Pirate Kingpin once again.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-115809-1715857094499.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Last but not least, we will not be fully resetting the number of Pieces of Eight collected throughout Season 1 but applying a soft reset instead to all players who accumulated more than 300,000 Pieces of Eight. Effectively, most of you will get to keep all your Pieces of Eight in your wallet, while a few will see their balance reduced to that number.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="433" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Barely any PS2 games have been added to the PlayStation Plus Classics catalog since the service’s 2022 revamp, and the ones that are included are HD conversions or remasters, meaning they lack the additional features seen in the emulated Play Station 1 and PlayStation Portable titles. However, that may be about to change according to a leaked listing for an upcoming re-release of 2002’s <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> game.</p> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">This comes courtesy of <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PS Deals</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>), which specialises in tracking the backend of the PS Store for updates. The listing obviously isn’t live, but PS Deals was able to find and share a description and screenshots for <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars </em>alongside a purported release date of June 11. This should mean we’ll see the game added to the Classics catalog in next month’s update.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">What’s most interesting, however, is how the game will be “enhanced with up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters.” This will make it the first PS2 game on the catalog to have such features, and seems to suggest that there’ll finally be a dedicated PS2 emulator on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Ideally, this will result in PS2 games being more frequently added to the service.</p>
 <p data-characters="611" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">I can think of several PS2 classics that myself and fans would love to see arrive on PS Plus via emulation, such as the original <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em> and <em>Sly Cooper</em> games. Although I wouldn’t be surprised if more obscure choices took priority considering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/playstation-plus-premium-ps1-ps2-psp-classics-playable-on-ps4-ps5-game-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s track record with the catalog</a> so far. To date, the PS1 line-up still lacks era defining games like the first <em>Tomb Raider</em> and the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series, but does have <em>Buzz Lightyear of Star Command</em>. Not to mention it seems the first of these emulated PS2 games will be a <em>Star Wars</em> movie tie-in rather than any major first-party exclusive.</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Still, we can always hope, and more PS2 games is better than none. It should at least add some extra value to the Premium tier for PS Plus and, depending on which games are added, could incentivise more people into subscribing. Maybe one day, Sony will somehow get a PlayStation 3 emulator working too, so we don’t have to make do with its cloud streaming service to play old PS3 games.</p>

            <p>
Toys for Bob has updated its website with a new logo, leading to fan speculation of new Crash Bandicoot or Spyro games.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.toysforbob.com/">The website</a> now leads to a black page with just a new central logo of a Tiki mask in purple. What could it mean?
</p>
<p>
Toys for Bob is, of course, most notably the developer behind Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. The Tiki mask would hint at Crash, while the purple colour would indicate Spyro.

<p>

Does this mean the company is in fact working on new games in these series? Fans have certainly been <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1790818824465330387">speculating as much on social media</a>.

<figcaption>Is this the new studio logo or something more? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Toys for Bob</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>
Equally, is this just a new logo for the developer that combines the two games? The image itself is named "TFB_LogoVector_TikiMask-purple", which would imply as such. Indeed, one post on X suggests this is an old logo, adding the studio previously had a Tiki bar theme.

Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">studio parted with Activision to go independent</a>, but is "exploring a possible partnership" with Microsoft.

</p>
<p>
That follows Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard and subsequent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">lay off 1900 employees across Xbox</a>, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-layoffs-affect-86-staff-at-spyro-crash-bandicoot-studio">86 from Toys for Bob</a>.


</p>
<p>
"Over the years, we've inspired love, joy, and laughter for the inner child in all gamers," the studio wrote at the time in a statement on its website. "We pioneered new IP and hardware technologies in Skylanders. We raised the bar for best-in-class remasters in Spyro Reignited Trilogy. We've taken Crash Bandicoot to innovative, critically acclaimed new heights."
</p>
<p>
"With the same enthusiasm and passion we believe that now is the time to take the studio and our future games to the next level. This opportunity allows us to return to our roots of being a small and nimble studio."
</p>
<p>
This statement now no longer exists due to the updated website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24157533/asus-rog-ally-x-prototype-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On June 2nd, Asus will formally announce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">the ROG Ally X</a>, a semi-sequel to its handheld gaming PC with <em>a way bigger battery</em>.<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152945/asus-rog-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-2024-revision">We exclusively revealed</a> the broad strokes last Thursday, but I’ve now touched an early engineering sample, too — and I’m pleased to say it’s far more comfortable to hold. </p><p>Asus has made a whole bunch of ergonomic changes that make it practically melt into my hands, in the exact way the original did not. While I still prefer the Steam Deck’s beefier grips and symmetrical thumbsticks, the Ally X could easily be my runner-up.</p><p>First, a disclaimer: <em>this is not what I’d consider a proper hands-on</em>. Asus wouldn’t let me power it on, play any games, or show you any photos. I couldn’t bring the old ROG Ally into the room or use any tools. The company even covered its ports with black electrical tape to keep me from sleuthing too much! </p><p>But I figure you’ll appreciate a discussion of the design changes anyhow. Let’s get into it, shall we? </p><div><figcaption><em>The original ROG Ally, below the original Steam Deck.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Imagine a black ROG Ally — a black version of the white handheld you see in the image above. That’s how the ROG Ally X looks from the front: same big screen bezels, same glossy cover glass, same button layout, same speaker placement, almost the same exact shape throughout. But instead of palm rests with bumpy corners, you now get smooth curves.</p><p>Flip it over, and those curves dominate the handheld’s rear grips, with no more unnecessary edges. Asus no longer makes you try to wrap your fingers around embedded versions of ROG’s trademark diagonal slash — though the iridescent foil slash design mark itself is still there. </p><div><figcaption><em>The back of the original ROG Ally, as a visual aid. The Ally X back buttons and grips are quite different.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The new back buttons no longer embody the slash, either; they’ve been shrunk down to small, almost heart-shaped pebbles and moved further away from the grips. The grips aren’t as beefy as the Steam Deck’s, but there’s enough to get my fingers around.</p><p>Add it all together, and I can now pick up this handheld and hold it above my head without any edges digging into my fingers or palms. It’s easier to grip, and the back buttons no longer get in the way — they’re there if I need them, not if I don’t. </p><p>It’s not a light handheld. The bigger battery will make it a thicker and heavier one, and the engineering sample definitely had more heft than the original. But I wouldn’t say it felt <em>heavy</em>, either, thanks to the added comfort when holding it. </p><p>I won’t guess at its weight, but I <em>can</em> give you an educated guess at thickness: maybe a third of an inch thicker at most. </p><p>How can I tell? I used my index finger as a ruler! The handheld’s “tablet” portion is roughly as thick as the length of my index fingertip, and the grips add roughly the thickness of my index fingernail. Since my fingertip’s about an inch long (27mm), and my fingernail’s about half an inch long (13mm), the Ally X is roughly 1.5 inches and 40mm thick in total. Meanwhile, the original ROG Ally is 1.27 inches (32mm) thick, and 0.83 inches (21mm) of that is its tablet region.</p><p>While I mentioned earlier that the Ally melted into my hands, I do feel saying that is a bit premature: the engineering sample I saw was an entirely unfinished, smooth, cheap-looking piano black, and Asus plans to stipple and texture its grips before launch.</p><p>So that’s the sculpt... what about the rest? It’s pretty hard to judge without actually playing a game, but here’s what <em>I think I noticed</em> playing around:</p><div><ul><li>The ABXY face buttons feel like they’ve nudged slightly southward, closer to the analog stick, so that the B button now slightly intersects the grip</li><li>The face buttons are a little less rattle-y, though they still do pleasingly rattle</li><li>The joysticks now have a nicely tacky rubber coating in the middle, like the Steam Deck OLED — their throw felt slightly tighter, too</li><li>The D-pad now has eight-way indicators and felt very slightly floatier</li><li>The triggers maybe have a touch more throw and still have a nice smooth pull</li><li>There’s still just two back buttons</li><li>It still uses Phillips head screws</li><li>You still get RGB LED ring lights around the sticks; I couldn’t tell if they’d been added to the buttons, but they’re still double-shot</li><li>I could see through vent gaps in the chassis that there’s still a pair of fans inside</li></ul></div><p>That’s all I was able to glean — but if Asus manages to nail comfort <em>and</em> battery life without a much higher price tag, this’ll definitely be a handheld to watch. Leaker @MysteryLupin <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1789672436918538420">claims it will cost $799</a> and come with 1TB of storage, <a href="https://twitter.com/MysteryLupin/status/1790769227214782940">24GB of RAM, and up to eight hours of battery life</a> — but if I recall correctly, Asus claimed the original Ally had up to eight hours of battery life, too.</p><p>I guess we’ll find out in June!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Lies of P DLC expansion is going to be released before the end of the year, developer NEOWIZ confirmed.</p>
<p>As spotted by Ziostorm on <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, the Korean developer confirmed in its latest financial report a second-half of 2024 release window for the DLC. A precise release date hasn't been confirmed, but with so many Summer showcases coming up, it is likely we will learn more about it in the near future.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lies of P DLC will be released later this year according to the Neowiz fiscal report. <br>-<br>It is currently windowed for the second half of 2024, but an exact release date hasn't been announced. The fiscal year for Korea is Jan 1-Dec 31 so we can expect it before the calendar end. <a href="https://t.co/1tq9X1W9hD">pic.twitter.com/1tq9X1W9hD</a></p>
<p>— Ziostorm (@Ziostorm1) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1/status/1790751397501177926?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lies of P is among the best Soulslike games released in the past few years. While it doesn't even attempt to hide the massive influence FromSoftware's Bloodborne had on it, the game developed by NEOWIZ has enough going on to stand for itself, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Not even attempting to hide the massive influence Bloodborne has had on it, Lies of P is a solid imitation of the game developed by FromSoftware. While it lacks the same combat and world design finesse of its illustrious inspiration, the action role-playing game by NEOWIZ is among the most accomplished soulslike game released this year, thanks to its dark retelling of the story of Pinocchio, combat and character customization tweaks and great enemy design.</em></p>
<p>Lies of P is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft will now focus on open world and live service games, as it invests in AI to assist development.
</p>
<p>
The strategy was outlined in the company's latest financial report, which claims record annual sales - in particular for the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.
</p>
<p>
The company's next games slot neatly into this strategy: namely Star Wars Outlaws, the newly-revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and free-to-play shooter XDefiant.

<p>

"We have made the choice to play to our strengths and are sharpening our strategic focus on two verticals, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences," reads Ubisoft's latest financial report.
</p>
<p>
"This focus not only offers profitable growth and recurrence prospects but also allows us to leverage and better cross-fertilise Ubisoft's established brands as well as ongoing targeted investments in proprietary technologies to reach and sustain a competitive advantage."
</p>
<p>
For open world games, Ubisoft specifically mentions Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, The Division, Ghost Recon and Star Wars.
</p>
<p>
Notably, open world series Watch Dogs appears to be no more, after the mixed response to the London-set Watch Dogs Legion. 
</p>
<p>
As for live service games, Ubisoft cites the success of Rainbow Six Siege alongside the forthcoming XDefiant, Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division Resurgence.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft also quietly announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-free-to-play-shooter-the-division-heartland-cancelled-three-years-after-being-announced">cancellation of free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland</a>. Little was known about this game, though presumably it somehow did not fit into this new strategy as the company focuses on "bigger opportunities".

</p>
<p>
To achieve all this, Ubisoft is relying on both its "proprietary cutting-edge technologies" to enable innovation and facilitate sharing across studios, as well as using generative AI.
</p>
<p>
At GDC earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">Ubisoft unveiled NEO NPC</a> that uses generative AI to create characters in its games. "It is designed to transform the way players interact with non-playable characters and create more immersive gameplay experiences," said Ubisoft in this new report. "And beyond several ongoing internal projects, Ubisoft also partners with leading AI companies on joint initiatives."

</p>
<p>
NEO NPC remains something of a prototype, so it's unclear if this technology has been used in Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws, or if it will be employed in future games instead.
</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following the report's release, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot provided further details on the AI strategy. "We have two groups working on gen AI," he said. "One pool to the different jobs that we have - marketing, sales, IT, legal, and all the other jobs - where we look at how we can be more efficient, and how we can automatise a certain number of things. That's coming along quite well, with good systems to improve our efficiency there."</p>
<p>The second group is focused on "how we can improve the quality of our games, in making those games more alive. So we did present a new NPC at the last conference. It was well appreciated, and it showed what we will be able to do in our games that will make them more alive and richer. So I expect a lot from gen AI in our games, to make our games more interesting and for people to really have a personalised experience."</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, Ubisoft will reveal more of its forthcoming games at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-forward-showcase-for-june">Ubisoft Forward event</a> on 10th June. We'll likely get further looks at both Assassin's Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.

</p>
<p>
The showcase takes place the same week as the next Xbox showcase, and Geoff Keighley's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12-gb-lpddr5x-ram-better-xbox-series-s/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM the Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to feature could deliver better texture quality than the Xbox Series S, and address many of the visual quality issues of the current Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> analyzed the latest round of<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-12gb-ram/"> Nintendo Switch 2 leaks</a>, focusing on the 12 GB LPDDR5X RAM the new console is said to feature. This would a massive upgrade over the RAM of the original Switch, which has been proven over and over how much of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-overclocking-ram-performance/">bottleneck</a> it was for the vast majority of titles. Even if the console's RAM will not run at full speed, it should have more than enough bandwidth for the processor, so multiplatform games are likely not going to compromise too much, considering the 10 GB RAM of the Xbox Series S. The 12 GB RAM will also allow the system to upscale to "reasonable" resolutions using NVIDIA DLSS, which has an intense memory cost, as textures need to be at the resolution of the output resolution to achieve the best results and thus require more memory. This would address the low image quality the current console delivers in docked mode in certain titles, mostly multiplatform games.</p>
<p>Equipped with 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially deliver better texture quality than the Xbox Series S, although the new Nintendo system is unlikely to match the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/">performance</a> of the Microsoft's console. Using DOOM Eternal as an example, the Xbox Series S has the processing power to handle the light ray tracing the game features, but not without some heavy trade offs in terms of texture quality, due to its RAM.</p>

<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/"> Nintendo Switch 2</a> has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/can-you-wake-up-hypnos-in-hades-2/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=can-you-wake-up-hypnos-in-hades-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As is tradition, Supergiant Games has stuffed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-is-a-magical-massive-early-access-worth-getting-into-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hades 2</a> with interesting NPCs and interesting dialogue. Of major interest to players is sleepy-headed Hypnos, who can be found napping to the right of Hecate’s cauldron at The Crossroads.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">Hypnos is a returning character from <em>Hades 2</em>, and looks extremely comfortable curled up in his red cloak, strewn in a hammock, and enjoying some rest. He has been asleep since the events of the last game, and was actually brought by Hecate to The Crossroads after Cronos decided to take over Hades. Of course, you will be curious whether it is possible to rouse Hynos from his slumber, so we have the answers you need.</p>
 <h2 id="h-can-you-wake-up-hypnos" data-injectable="false">Can you wake up Hypnos?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="798" data-injectable="true">At the moment, it is not possible to wake up Hypnos in <em>Hades 2</em>. Known as “Sleep Incarnate”, he is true to his title and refuses to fully wake, no matter what you do. Should you speak to him he will remain asleep, and even if you give him a gift, you cannot wake him as he will just mumble at you a little. There doesn’t appear to be much reason to give him such gifts right now, so you might as well hold on to them for a while, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-keepsakes-in-hades-2-and-how-to-get-them-nectar-gift-guide/">or give them to other characters to gain Keepsakes</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="568" data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true">Hypnos in <em>Hades 2</em> is a little different to how he was first shown in the original game. It’s hard to know if this will change dramatically over the course of early access, but Hypnos was one of the very first NPCs we met in the first game. His job was to meet people who made their way to Hades, but would often be asleep on the job. This time around, they are deep in a slumber that we cannot wake them from. It seems likely that it will be our job to wake them up, or we will hit a point in the story as the game develops that will see him wake up on his own. </p>
 <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="false">The first time you speak to him, Melinoë will express a desire to wake him up, so you can bet it is on the cards, one way or another. An interesting piece of information is that Hypnos and Nemesis are actually brother and sister, so you can expect some fun interactions from them when the time comes. I’ll be playing Hades 2 religiously throughout the early access period, and shall return to this article to update it as soon as there is a way to get lazy Hypnos out of bed.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve played <em>Warzone</em> since Season 3 Reloaded, there’s a decent chance that you’ve been beaten to death by a Tonfa stick. Despite the developer nerfing them, <em>Warzone</em> players still think they are way too strong, and are begging for them to be made useless. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Before the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-may-15-update-patch-notes-riveter-and-tonfa-nerfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 15 patch</a>, the Tonfa killed players faster than any other weapon in the game inside a three-meter distance. That’s because with just three hits of the Tonfa, a player can kill an enemy with full health and three armor plates, which is very strong considering how quickly you can swing it. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">Now, while it takes four hits with the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tonfas-have-strong-potential-to-take-over-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tonfa</a> to eliminate players, fans of the battle royale still think it’s too powerful, and were not impressed with the nerf handed down. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This thing haunts me. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1csqx8a/tonfa_nerf_changed_basically_nothing/?sort=new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on the official <em>Warzone</em> subreddit, which claimed the patch “changed basically nothing,” players vented their frustrations. </p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">“So useful,” wrote Moistman123456. “Regardless, that little sh*t can still aim-lock you like a free Cronus Zen, hit you so fast you barely have enough time to pull out your gun before getting battered and beaten to oblivion, and it’s still ridiculously overpowered.”</p> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">As for how they’re performing in-game now, Formal-Cry7565 stated that he had just been “screwed out of a 20 kill win by a dude camping behind a bathroom door with that weapon in about 0.2 seconds,” while Dreadnar called the the nerfs “a joke” and said most people were still running Tonfas in his Plunder matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="191" data-injectable="false">With these nerfs seemingly not doing enough, IDKWTFG suggested nerfing “them into oblivion until no one wants to use them, and then slowly buff them back to a level that is fair.”</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">“It feels like you could quadruple the TTK on them and they’d still probably be annoying to deal with,” they continued. “If there is anything in this game that feels broken, OP, annoying, [or] doesn’t feel right, it’s dealing with melee.”</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">While it’s good news that <em>Warzone</em>‘s development team is paying attention to fans and dropped the nerf, it clearly hasn’t gone far enough. I actually stopped playing <em>Warzone</em> at the weekend because of the Tonfa, and until I hear that the issue is properly addressed, I’ll stay clear. I’d rather not play at all than get beaten to death every game, that’s for sure. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is the latest Ubisoft blockbuster to warn players they'll need an online connection when first installing the game - despite the fact it is otherwise an offline title. 
</p>
<p>
Shadows follows in the footsteps of last year's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and the upcoming Star Wars Outlaws in requiring an internet connection to first play physical copies of the game. 
</p>
<p>
All three titles include a warning note on the front of their box, visible by retailers such as <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/assassins-creed-shadows-gold-edition-xbox-series-x/6584016.p?skuId=6584016">Best Buy</a>: "Internet required to install the game."

</figure>
<p>
While this is likely due to the need to install a mandatory day one update for the game, it's still unclear to what extent Shadows will also rely on Ubisoft's mysterious new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a> hub/launcher/thing, which will launch alongside the game and act as a central home to the franchise going forward.

 </a>
<figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows box art. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>
Shadows does not feature any online play, and indeed it has now been a decade since the last major Assassin's Creed title to feature any form of multiplayer (2014's Paris-set Unity, which featured campaign co-op). 
</p>
<p>
There are also the usual concerns around servers eventually being switched off, and the longevity of online games in general (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">Ubisoft has now completely deleted online racer The Crew</a> after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">taking its servers offline</a>), though its difficult to see Shadows getting pulled any point in the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft debuted its first cinematic trailer for Assassin's Creed Shadows yesterday, which introduced the game's dual protagonists - a shinobi and a samurai - who ultimately team up and offer two distinct playstyles.
</p>
<p>
Shadows is set in 16th century feudal Japan, and is developed primarily by the Assassin's Creed Odyssey team at Ubisoft Quebec, assisted by no less than 15 support studios, including teams in Osaka and Tokyo.
</p>
<p>Yesterday also brought news of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-details-premium-editions-collectors-edition-plus-season-pass-featuring-exclusive-quest">Assassin's Creed Shadows collector's editions</a>, which include the game's season pass for two DLC expansions and an exclusive quest.</p>

            <p>Our Edders, the RPSer I’d most trust to help me gank a rival covenant member with hammers, reckoned Pinocchio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">soulslike</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> was an “instant must-play” in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">his review</a>, and I was pretty fond of it myself. We already know that we’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-lies-of-p-is-getting-a-sequel-after-selling-a-million-copies">due a sequel</a> at some point the future, thanks to impressive sales. Director Jiwon Choi previously teased some DLC concept art, and now it looks like we’ll be seeing that DLC by the time the year’s out, according to a fiscal report.</p>

<p>The fiscal report, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ziostorm1/status/1790751397501177926">spotted</a> by content creator Ziostorm, details upcoming releases for the remainder of the Korean fiscal year, which is handily just the actual year, running January 1st to December 31st. Lies of P’s DLC, unnamed at present, is slated for the second half of 2024. The soulslike has previously seen several substantial updates, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-casual-soulslikers-lies-of-ps-latest-update-makes-it-dramatically-easier">such as difficulty adjustments</a>, but this'll be its first expansion - assuming its not some rabbit costumes or another pair of wireframe glasses that make you look like a scholar that’s one hit of laudanum away from dying of consumption. Good news, then, if you’re up for some more puppet parrying. (Actually, it was more focused around blocking, but I’ll never let the truth interrupt even the most minor opportunity for alliteration, hack that I am.)</p>
<p>In other ‘more soulslike to go on top of the soulslikes we already have please’ news, the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-date">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> draws ever closer. I know about as much as you at this point, which is to say: I know it’ll have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-enemy-revealed-a-bloke-with-a-basket-for-a-head">some blokes with baskets for heads</a>. The woman with a basket on her head was actually my favourite Sekiro fight, so this bodes well.</p>

			<p>More former Xbox exclusives could be coming to PS5 during this holiday season, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ResetEra forums in a thread about a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new WindowsCentral Xbox article</a>, noted insider NateDrake has said that he's heard that, aside from Starfield, more Xbox games might be headed to Sony's console later this year. Yesterday, the insider mentioned that Starfield <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-7?post=123020469#post-123020469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might end up hitting PS5 as a complete edition sometime in late 2025</a>. Later on, 'NateDrake' said that, between possibly Starfield in 2025, there could be other games coming to PS5. "Who said there wouldn't be anything between the 4 from earlier this year and that?", the insider<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-8?post=123026721#post-123026721" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> wrote</a> yesterday.</p>
<p>Earlier today, he clarified his post from yesterday, saying that he was only referring to Bethesda's hit title, but he's heard of other games coming to Sony's console, although he isn't entirely sure about which titles and when they will be released. "Yes. Was strictly talking about Starfield there", 'NateDrake'<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-microsofts-quest-for-short-term-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond.871437/page-10?post=123039288#post-123039288" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> wrote</a> today. "I've heard of other games coming to PS5 &amp; they could be during holiday season this year -- but working to confirm the games &amp; the release windows."</p>
<p>While this doesn't confirm that additional Xbox exclusives are coming to PS5, recent rumors and reports suggest that this is likely the case. Last month, The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-xbox-exclusives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the Sea of Thieves PS5 version was a key test for Microsoft for whether other games will make their way to rival platforms. Additionally, earlier this month, Warren said that Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-still-evaluating-whether-to-put-cod-on-game-pass-and-a-game-pass-price-increase-hellblade-ii-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is still evaluating whether Ninja Theory's upcoming Hellblade 2 will be ported to Sony's console as well</a>. Interestingly enough, back February of this year, Warren also suggested that Microsoft has been considering to bring other popular Xbox flagship franchises to rival platforms, including Gears of War and DOOM. "I understand that Microsoft has also previously been weighing up the idea of bringing Gears of War, Microsoft Flight Simulator, and even the next Doom game to rival platforms", Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-was-considering-bringing-gears-and-next-doom-to-rival-platforms-tom-warren-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in February.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dynamic-weather-system-will-keep-changing-how-you-play-the-game/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=assassins-creed-shadows-dynamic-weather-system-will-keep-changing-how-you-play-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="324" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ubisoft recently shared proper information on its Japan-set <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/assassins-creed-shadows-carves-a-bloody-path-through-feudal-japan-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em>. Aside from two trailers, which confirmed two playable protagonists, developer Ubisoft Québec has given some further insight about the game’s new mechanics, but the one that most intrigues me is its new dynamic weather system.</p> <p data-characters="579" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">I’ve always been a fan of dynamic weather systems in games, mostly for how they make a world feel more alive and can radically alter the mood of a scenario. Sometimes, though, they can offer more than just an aesthetic difference and can alter gameplay, like how rain makes it more difficult to climb up walls in <em>T<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a></em>. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN interview</a>, the staff at Ubisoft Québec explained how the changing seasons in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> have a direct influence on gameplay, drastically affecting how you approach completing objectives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="564" data-current-count="864" data-injectable="true">One example producer Karl Onnée provides is how, in summer time, you can go underwater in ponds to hide from enemies. Come winter time and those ponds will have frozen over. You may need to ditch your favoured hiding spots as the seasons progress, but this in turn opens up new opportunities. The stronger winds, for instance, will help obscure the sound of your footsteps, making it easier to sneak up on enemies. As creative director Jonathan Dumont succinctly puts it, “Players will have to adapt constantly to what the environment is giving them.”</p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> certainly isn’t the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game to have a weather system, but I don’t think it’s ever had one as advanced as what Ubisoft is promising for <em>Shadows</em>. What’s especially unique is that the seasons don’t just rotate after enough time has passed. Instead, the seasons change when you hit certain points in the story, which allows for an added sense of realism and suggests the events of <em>Shadows</em> will take place over the course of a whole year.</p>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">According to art director Thierry Dansereau, some side quests can be attempted during different seasons: “When in an open world [side] quest, it might happen that you will play a quest in autumn and I will play the same quest and I’m going to be in summer.” This should mean how you approach completing side quests will depend on the current season, allowing for players to come up with different methods. It may even make some quests more challenging or easier to complete.</p>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="false">It’s obviously still too early to tell how this game will turn out, but so far <em>Shadows</em> is shaping up to be the most interesting <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game in a long time. Elsewhere in the interview, Ubisoft is also promising a stronger emphasis on stealth and parkour, which combined with a revised combat system is making <em>Shadows</em> sound like an ideal hybrid between the modern action-RPG <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games and the original stealth-based entries.</p>

        <p>Current vice president of Northern Europe John Galloway to retire from his position</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Bandai Namco has announced the appointment of Adrien Guerra as country manager for the UK and Nordics.</p>
<p>Guerra assumed the role on April 1, 2024, and is based at the company's UK headquarters in Richmond, London.</p>
<p>Guerra joined Bandai Namco in 2009 as marketing and communications director for the France-Benelux region, and previously worked for Electronic Arts as senior international marketing manager from 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p>"The UK and the Nordics are key territories for development in Europe, so I feel both honoured and excited to work with the amazing teams that John Galloway has assembled," said Guerra.</p>
<p>Guerra's appointment follows the retirement of Galloway, the current vice president of Northern Europe, who will leave Bandai Namco in June after 15 years with the games firm.</p>
<p>"It's been an amazing 15 years with Bandai Namco, and 30 years in this industry," said Galloway. "I leave knowing the teams, the company and growth are in capable hands with Adrien taking up the helm.</p>
<p>"Thank you to all our partners I have had the pleasure of working with over the years, and the teams in the UK and Nordics, along with the German and CEE teams."</p>

            <p>As Ubisoft revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-both-a-samurai-and-a-ninja-game-as-it-borrows-syndicates-dual-character-story">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> they also released their earnings report for the financial year 2023-2024. Buried among the chatter of "profitable growth trajectories" and "B2B partnerships" was a brief note about looter shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-heartland">The Division Heartland</a>. "Ubisoft has decided to stop development on The Division Heartland," it reads, "and has redeployed resources to bigger opportunities such as XDefiant and Rainbow Six." Ah, so this is the games industry equivalent of being summarily dumped by text.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Division Heartland is (was) a free-to-play survival shooter set in a small fictional town in middle America. It was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tom-clancys-the-division-heartland-is-a-new-standalone-free-to-play-game-and-thats-all-we-know">announced back in 2021</a> and was set to tie into the Division's overall storyline while showing the pandemic's fallout from a more rural perspective. In truth we didn't see much of it but from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-heartlands-free-to-play-survival-shooting-goes-rural-while-the-division-2-goes-back-to-new-york">glimpses of the developer's work</a> it was intended to play something like an extraction shooter, with players squirreling for items during the day and fending off other players at night. </p>
<p>It basically sounded like the Dark Zone of the mainline Division Games would be permanently switched on. And it supposedly had <a href="https://www.redstorm.com/news-2/79t2h4hd65ooy50l33nfqro1ffpcy2/heartlandclosedbeta">a closed beta</a> in June last year, but I don't know anyone who took part. The studio behind it, Red Storm Entertainment, are a long-running studio originally co-founded by Tom Clancy, the inventor of guns.</p>
<p>Ubisoft elaborated on their decision, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">telling IGN</a>: "After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six."</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">best multiplayer games</a>, so I guess that makes business sense? Elsewhere in the Ubisoft's earnings report, the company lauded its "cost reduction" efforts, pointing out a decrease of "more than 1700" employees. That figure will include natural turnover as people come and go, but it also includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">all the workers</a> <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-plans-to-close-mobile-studio-ubisoft-london-formerly-known-as-future-games-of-london/">Ubisoft laid off</a>. They reported an operating income of €401.4 million.</p>

			<p>2064: Read Only Memories was a game that never fully piqued my interest. I love the idea of a sci-fi anime-esque adventure, but the aesthetic of that game never seemed as tightly dialled in as I would have wanted it to be. It’s sequel, though, has looked exactly like the game I’ve been waiting for.&nbsp;I was hooked from the first reveal trailer for Read Only Memories: Neurodiver, mouth nearly watering at the technicolor characters and gorgeously rendered future streets. Now, after ages of delays, I’ve finally gotten to sit down and play the game, and I just desperately wish there was more of it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neurodiver Release Date Announce!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ljJbTUUfBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Read Only Memories: Neurodiver drops you into Neo-San Francisco in the year 2070, controlling a mind-reading psychic detective named ES-88 – AKA Luna Cruz de la Vega. While some sci-fi worlds are dense and dreary and soaked in neon, Neo-San Francisco and the people who inhabit it are the exact opposite. There’s a cheery veneer and uncompromising comfort to every inch of this world that reminded me of the bright and bubbly world of the Ace Attorney&nbsp;series. Every pixel is spent rendering a world you almost wish you could live in, and every background detail features an unexpected cameo or out-of-pocket gag waiting to reveal itself. While most of Read Only Memories: Neurodiver is a linear visual novel with bits of pointing-and-clicking bolted on, there’s enough life to the world that I never felt trapped or limited by this format.</p>


<p>As ES-88, you work at a technology information company called Minerva as one of their elite Espers – a psyche-exploring agent who can access, rewire, and recover a client’s memories with the assistance of a synthetic life-form called the Neurodiver. Mind crimes and mental palaces and non-linear memory-driven storytelling are some of my favorite tropes in sci-fi media, so this immediately got me hooked on the premise.</p>


<p>Then, when the Ace Attorney similarities hit me, I was expecting and hoping for this game to be just as beefy as one of those titles, providing me with a bunch of different layered memory-hunting cases to sink my teeth into. Unfortunately, Read Only Memories: Neurodiver only focuses on one major memory-thief – the Golden Butterfly – and this singular adventure can be completed in just a few hours. There are so many corners of Neo-San Francisco left unexplored and so many characters barely touched that by the time I was really getting invested in ES-88s journey it was already wrapping up.</p>
<p>There’s so much charm to Read Only Memories: Neurodiver, and it’s all so natural and raw. You can tell that the creators of this game put every ounce of themselves and their nerdy hobbies into it, and that unabashed love for media is infectious. One character might have an unexpected obsession with magical girl manga, or a patron in the back of a bar might actually be a famous Japanese game developer. Sometimes, you’re hit with a classic anime commercial-stinger while a random character shouts the name of the game. It’s all cheesy and charming in a perfectly balanced way.</p>

<p>That said, when it comes to the voice acting, I think it’s just downright cheesy. Characters have incredibly well-fitting actors cast to play them, but the voice direction is distractingly inconsistent – not just missing the tone of the writing, but also the tone of the other actors in the same scene. I actually spent most of the game with voice-acting muted, feeling far more satisfied with the dialogue-box blips accompanying each line than I was with the voice acting. While it didn’t land for me,&nbsp;you could argue the clunky voice acting is part of Read Only Memories: Neurodiver’s charm.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Read Only Memories: Neurodiver is a game that wears it's influences on it's sleeve, from corny 90s anime dubs to slick sci-fi and even Mexican culture. It's all worn and shown off so proudly that the resulting mix is loud, proud, and unforgettable. I just wish that it was so much longer, because I already miss my time in Neo-San Francisco.	</p></div>

			<p>Following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-update-1-11-33-60fps-40fps-uncapped-xbox-series-x-improved-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brief testing phase</a> via the Steam beta branch, Bethesda Game Studios has now <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1790778440716517666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the Starfield May update on both PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>These are the main improvements you'll find in this Starfield patch, according to the development team:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Improved surface maps - We’ve heard your feedback, and we’ve made some big improvements to surface maps, so you’ll always know just where to go and no longer “get lost” on the way to your parents’ place (and they weren’t buying that excuse anyway, you should really go visit them).</em></li>
<li><em>New gameplay options - For those of you who like a bit of an extra challenge or want to make some aspects of the game easier, you can customize your experience with brand new options in the Settings menu. Want to make ground combat harder but ship combat easier? You can do just that!</em></li>
<li><em>Added Ship Decoration mode to the interior of Ships – now you can decorate your ships just like you can with Outposts!</em></li>
<li><em>Added Tabs to Container menus to make managing your inventory easier.</em></li>
<li><em>Added the ability to change Traits and appearance after entering the Unity.</em></li>
<li><em>Added Dialogue camera toggle in the Settings.</em></li>
<li><em>Added Display settings for Xbox Series X to prioritize Visuals or Performance, adjust Frame Rate Target, and toggle VSync (Series X). With F</em><em>rame Rate Target you can now choose between 30, 40, 60 or an Uncapped frame rate on VRR displays. If you do not have a VRR display running 120hz, you will still be able to select from 30 or 60. Screen tearing may occur at times when selecting 60 on a non-VRR display.&nbsp;</em><em>You can also now prioritize between Visuals and Performance while trying to maintain the frame rate target. If you’re choosing a frame rate target of 60 or above, we recommend changing this to Performance. Prioritizing Visuals keeps the highest resolution while maintaining full detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Prioritizing Performance lowers internal resolution and detail for special effects, lighting, and crowds. Both modes may adjust internal resolution dynamically when scenes or action get heavier as well. When switching between modes, you will see the lighting change briefly as the system catches up to the new mode. Finally, y</em><em>ou can now toggle between VSync off or on. Choosing off will separate the game frames from the monitor's refresh rate, and may result in screen tearing. Toggling On will synchronize the frame rate to the monitor's refresh rate avoiding screen tearing but limiting number of frames.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>More major updates are expected for Starfield later this year, including the addition of a land vehicle and, of course, the Shattered Space story DLC <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-to-get-really-big-update-with-ship-building-improvements-soon-shattered-space-dlc-coming-this-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch this Fall</a>.</p>

			<p>The Italian Soulslike game Enotria: The Last Song has had its release date moved again. Originally slated to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/italian-ue5-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-to-launch-on-june-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on June 21</a>, it was first delayed to August 21 <a href="https://wccftech.com/enotria-the-last-song-launch-will-be-moved-due-to-elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because of the nearby launch of Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.</p>
<p>Now, developer Jyamma Games has pushed the launch to September 19. The good news is that the Xbox Series S|X version has been restored as a target platform. Moreover, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/enotria-the-last-song-dee164" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC</a> and PlayStation 5 players will be able to experience an eight-hour demo starting on Wednesday, May 22.</p>
<p>The demo experience is set in Quinta, the City of Actors. As the Mask of Change, players will face the Authors, formidable foes that created the Canovaccio, a twisted eternal play that keeps the world in an unnatural stasis. The demo will have four distinct weapon classes, each with a variety of unique weapons, and six unique masks to discover that bring with them devastating new play styles and distinctive passive abilities. Players will be able to customize different play styles by choosing from over 20 spells and 30 perks to make their own build.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are also due to open soon, and the developers have already clarified the differences between the Standard and the Deluxe Edition of Enotria: The Last Song. The former will include the base game, an extract from the original soundtrack, and some upgrade weapon materials. The Deluxe Edition adds 72 hours of early access, an extract from the digital artbook, an exclusive weapons skin set, some upgrade mask materials, some upgrade lines materials, some unspecified DLC, extra miracle pesto, extra hymn of vigor, and extra armonia sap.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enotria: The Last Song – Official 15-Minute Gameplay Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mu4WxO8M0Eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, Enotria: The Last Song is set in a sunny land inspired by Italy, which contrasts with the usual gloomy atmosphere of the Soulslike genre. The story is also inspired by Italian culture, specifically the so-called Commedia dell'Arte from Italian theater. In the game, the Canovaccio is a 'twisted form of eternal play that keeps everything in unnatural stasis'.</p>

                <p>WarioWare: Move It is the latest entry in the quirky series, offering more than 200 "microgames" designed to get you up off the couch. It's a fun party game (thanks to support for up to four players), and right now you can grab a physical copy for $30 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WarioWareTM-Move-Nintendo-Switch-US-Version/dp/B0C8VH1LQ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FWarioWare-Move-It%2F2403852496%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fboth-warioware-games-for-nintendo-switch-are-on-sale-at-amazon-and-walmart%2F1100-6519444%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>. This matches the lowest price since launching late last year.

The game follows in the footsteps of its predecessors, having you and a few friends take part in lightning-fast microgames that last just a few seconds. Most of them are motion-based, as you'll be chopping bamboo, curtseying to onlookers, and performing other off-the-wall actions.</p><p>Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warioware-move-it-review-i-am-merely-okay-to-move-it-move-it/1900-6418146/" data-ref-id="1900-6418146">WarioWare: Move It review</a> noted that, while not as good as some other entries in the series, there's a lot of fun to be had with this strange title.</p><p>"For WarioWare: Move It, Nintendo has repeated the pose-based games from the Wii's WarioWare: Smooth Moves," wrote critic Steve Watts. "But while the games are as wacky as ever and frequently hilarious, many of the poses (or "Forms") themselves are too complex… If your friend circle is willing to put in the time to learn all the poses--and deal with some potential technical hiccups--then you may have a good time."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2104565580" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I know that, among the more online elements of the video game community, there's a certain amount of disdain for sports games. Eww, sports games, or lmao, sports games. Part of that is justified--asking $60 a year for what are becoming increasingly minimal updates to the underlying experience is <em>bold</em>, to say the least--but a lot of it isn't, because it misunderstands a huge element of what playing sports games is about.</p><p>Multiplayer is huge in sports games, whether it's some friends on the couch or online competitions bringing in billions in in-game transaction sales. But these games also ship with singleplayer modes, those modes are popular, and for many people they're popular for one big reason: they're dream factories.</p><p>Let me explain. Sport is <em>cruel</em>. There is usually only one winner, out of many, and so every season the odds of your team coming away with a trophy range from slim to astronomical to none. Doesn't matter where you are in the world or what sport you're following (or playing in a video game), the story is the same. Ask a Lions fan or a Mariners fan, a Suns fan or a Spurs fan and they'll share the same sad stories of what it's like following a team that rarely, if ever, wins <em>anything</em>.</p><p>That hurts! And it's a feeling that compounds annually. The more you see other teams winning, other fans enjoying themselves and revelling in the glory, the more your own team's failures and shortcomings become ever more apparent. You start to wonder, well:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Doesn't Gil get a lick??" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRWAQ255qhs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which brings me to Aston Villa Football Club, who I am bound to support through family ties (my great granddad played a few games for them, and my Nan was born around the corner from Villa Park, their home ground). Founded in 1874, Villa are one of the oldest, proudest and--over that <em>entire </em>timespan--most successful sides in English football. The problem is that a lot of that success is front-loaded into the earlier half of the club's 150-year existence, and for most of my lifetime they have swung wildly from plucky upstart to midtable irrelevance to flawed masterpiece.</p><p>In 1981 Villa won the English first division (which would later become the Premier League). In 1982 they went one better and were crowned champions of Europe after defeating German powerhouses Bayern Munich in the final of what was then called the European Cup (and is now the Champions League). It doesn't get any better than that! Villa remain one of only six English sides to <em>ever </em>win it, and topped the whole thing off by beating Barcelona in the European Super Cup not long after.</p><p>That's an incredible run of success, enough to sustain some fans for a lifetime, but I was two years old at the time, so it doesn't mean much to me outside of historical admiration. Instead, all I get to remember is what happened next. Villa were relegated from the first division in 1986, made it back to the first division in time to finish second in 1989/90 and again in 1992 (the first ever season of the Premier League), won a couple of League Cups in the mid-90s and then...all hell broke loose.</p><p>The 28 years following that last League Cup win in 1996 have seen rollercoaster league finishes, a bunch of lost cup finals,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/4631238/2023/06/27/villa-structure-emery-sawiris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> four different owners</a>,<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/aston-villa-remi-garde-english-manchester-united-villa-b2529309.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> another relegation</a>,<a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/villa-steve-bruce-newcastle-united-17017203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> cabbage</a>, late-season collapses, a<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-47523268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> player getting punched by a fan <em>on the field</em></a> and much, much more. And in all that time, Villa haven't won <em>shit</em>. For a club of Villa's size, with its back catalogue of achievements, it's been an agonising wait to achieve anything of note outside of a few runs in smaller European competitions like the UEFA Cup and this year's Europa Conference League.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Celebrating 140 years of Aston Villa" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAY54jvd8Eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>(For fans of smaller sides who never play in Europe or don't even play in the top flight, I get it, this might sound spoiled! The same way I'd make pissbaby boo hoo faces at a Chelsea fan complaining it's been longer than 12 months since they last won a trophy. I hope you can realise I'm trying to talk about an imbalance in achievements vs the history and size of the club, and how my lifetime in particular has coincided with a relative dry spell!)</em></p><p>For that whole time, I've been in therapy. Not actual therapy, but sports video game therapy. As maligned as they can be, sports video games are very good at allowing fans of the bottlers, choke artists, downtrodden and plain <em>bad </em>teams the chance to dream. If we can't win anything in real life, at least we can win something in <em>FIFA</em>, or <em>Pro Evo</em>, or <em>Madden</em>, games that allow players to simulate alternate timelines where their terrible team can sign a superstar, catch some lucky breaks, beat their rivals and achieve glory. It's not <em>actual </em>glory, but for a brief shining moment, it's <em>something</em>.</p><p>From the early <em>FIFA </em>games through to <em>PES </em>and now back to <em>EA Sports FC</em>, I've been taking charge of Villa and, through career mode playthroughs, transformed the club from inconsistent irrelevance to global powerhouse. I've lost track of the number of stars who have graced my (virtual) Villa Park who would never have signed for the club in real life: Alan Shearer, Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Zidane, Pirlo, Aguero, Benzema, Messi, Odegaard and countless others. We've won cups, league titles, banished rivals to the shadow realm, and reigned supreme over English football for years or sometimes (thank you, <em>PES </em>Master League) <em>decades </em>at a time.</p><figure><figcaption>This was an astute signing</figcaption></figure><p>The crowning achievement every season, though, is playing in the Champions League, the chance for the biggest teams around Europe to face off and see who is the best of the best. Playing Brentford a couple of times a season is fine, I guess, but it's <em>way </em>sexier to have midweek nights away at Real Madrid or Milan. Yet every time my (virtual) Villa would embark on a Champions League campaign, it would be pure fantasy, digital wish fulfilment, because since the competition's inception in 1992 Villa have never qualified for the real thing. Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Spurs, Newcastle, Blackburn, Leeds and even Leicester have all had a shot, but never Villa.</p><p>Until now! This week Villa, resurgent under the management of Unai Emery,<a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2024/may/14/villa-champions-league-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> secured fourth spot in the Premier League and a guaranteed place in next season's Champions League</a>. I know it's not technically <em>winning </em>something, but given the magnitude of the achievement, it feels like it. For the first time ever, I'm going to sit down with a football video game next season and it won't be pure fantasy. Aston Villa will be there in the Champions League, with a seat at the big boy's table, for <em>real</em>. And it's a very weird feeling.</p><p>I'm joyous as a fan, of course. Having been playing in England's second division as recently as 2018 (<a href="https://www.balls.ie/football/aston-villa-crisis-390404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while on the brink of financial ruin</a>), the thought of squaring off against PSG and Barcelona in the Champions League just six years later is <em>wild</em>. But there's an extra layer of gratification here from my years in the digital desert. I feel like every season of faking it has made the year we actually <em>made </em>it all the more satisfying. All that compounded hurt, those decades spent playing pretend, and now the dream has actually come true.</p><p>It's a nice feeling! And we don't get many of those these days, so I'm going to cherish every second of it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Benjamin Zephaniah: Ode to Aston Villa" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YVOHu8qYSo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium.872409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/read-only-memories-neurodiver-review-monolithium<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been an uptick to the brightside lately, and that’s excluding the deluge of wholesome games that have become part and parcel of the indie scene as of late. Pessimism is no longer at the forefront, or at the very least, without a contextual reason to be uprooted - even our cyberpunk scene has to be hopeful. At the very least, <em>Read Only Memories: NEURODIVER</em> is an apt example of that.</p>
<p>This is the latest release from California-based developers MidBoss, and a sequel to their modest cyberpunk adventure game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/2064-read-only-memories-review-edited-memories"><em>2064: Read Only Memories</em></a>. Published by Chorus Worldwide Games, <em>Read Only Memories:</em> <em>NEURODIVER </em>fits rather snugly alongside their cozy adventure titles and point-n-click hybrids like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/coffee-talk"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-for-unbound"><em>A Space for The Unbound</em></a>.</p>
<p>Taking place 6 years after the original’s story involving the breakthrough of sapient machines, <em>NEURODIVER </em>focuses on a new character, ES88, a psychic detective working at MINERVA, a secretive organization specializing in neurotechnology. Together with the genetically engineered and titular “Neurodiver” and potential android flame GATE, you’re tasked with tracking down “Golden Butterfly”, a rogue telepath who has hidden themselves away in various memories of the population of Neo-San Francisco.</p>
<p>In turn, you dive into those memories yourself to unscramble them and figure out Golden Butterfly’s ulterior motive.</p>

<p>From a visual design standpoint, <em>NEURODIVER </em>does well to be pragmatic, not just by paying lip service to similar games like <em>Snatcher</em>, but to the real world as well. It’s a nostalgic burst of escapism contending with what a world would look like with just these technical advancements. It’s too much for flying cars, but under the right conditions, you can have body modifications, and a trans-atlantic train journey to reach California.</p>
<p>Narratively, however, <em>NEURODIVER </em>seems to insist that you have at least a modicum of knowledge in regard to its predecessor. The memory ironically wanes when it comes to my personal recollection of <em>2064: Read Only Memories</em>, not because of its accessible and, quite frankly, endearing world, but because the voice acting was an order too tall to elicit endearment. Thankfully, it’s an option you can turn off, both in <em>2064 </em>and <em>NEURODIVER</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a side story, or at least, feels like one. <em>2064 </em>is a deluge of conspiracies, all surface-level, but feeding into one another to build upward thanks to characterization, punchy moments, and emotional resonance. <em>NEURODIVER</em>, by comparison, is an antithesis of established ethos - not a betrayal of set-up, but an undermining of character, creation, connections, and simple study that either doesn’t trust the player to understand or assumes that they’re not there for thought.</p>

<p>As a game, <em>NEURODIVER </em>takes a hatchet to the point-n-click elements that established <em>2064 </em>in favor of a solitary puzzle element. When ES88 dives into people's memories, it plays out like normal, with ES88 and the recipient in person providing commentary and thoughts about why it’s the memory chosen to be scrambled. Once the corrupted memory shows up, you pick up a small smattering of items found in the memory and jam them together until the memory unscrambles.</p>
<p>It’s a mechanic that quickly loses its luster once you realize just how little <em>NEURODIVER </em>cares about it to begin with. Indeed, once you begin to piece together the major players in the story, the game quickly deflates any expectation, as you don’t get a Neo-San Fran mystery to defy the ages, but a character study of impressively minimal proportions.</p>
<p>The result is a story that forces a static conclusion, one which fails to intensify its necessity and relies on remembrance, funnily enough. Maybe this is the issue when <em>2064 </em>offers up espionage, conspiratorial claims, and technological achievements that’d see Harlan Ellison throw a fit, and the best <em>NEURODIVER </em>can offer is a lack of workplace security. Even with returning characters like Lexi Rivers, TOMCAT, and Turing, the cast is paltry and fails to make a dent in establishing any new faces.</p>

<p>This clearly hurts the new protagonist the most, ES88’s painfully flighty demeanor and unintended arrogance constantly undermining the danger she finds herself in. Instead, <em>NEURODIVER </em>moves at the pace of a hypercar, 3 years going by in the blink of an eye, and ES88 manages to portray that she’s learned next to nothing in her time at MINERVA.</p>
<p>Still, this would all be fine if the writing wasn’t so childish. Characters supposedly learn lessons, providing answers yet it’s never taken to the test, always a cause, but never an effect, nothing connects when it feels like it should. One of the few major story choices that can define how characters view you from that point on has such an absurdly evil position to take, yet its opposite is one of such obvious intent, that ES88 has to crowbar in a moral dilemma.</p>
<p>What is MINERVA? What’s the point of their operations? We’ve seen a world with ravaging wars, androids working overtime so their newfound personalities and titanium alloy skin don’t go to waste, and the best <em>NEURODIVER </em>can offer is tantamount to the Mystery Machine. We’re just short of a talking dog, and a man behind the mask.</p>
<p>The only difference is that there is no mystery here, not at least one that coalesces into a conclusion. <em>NEURODIVER </em>does well to set up, but never pays off exactly what this means for ES88, for MINERVA, for Neo-San Francisco, for the world. This is a fan-fiction, an advert for posters, and a reminder that nostalgia conquers all, and should define each aspect of your position.</p>


<p>It’s easy to fall for <em>Read Only Memories: </em><em>NEURODIVER</em>. When its predecessor offers pronouns and preferences to directly suit you, it’s clear to see that MidBoss wants the world to cultivate you as much as you do it. Here, however, we have a character study of a supposedly sympathetic mule, one whose only parallels to humanity revolve around their taste in media.</p>
<p>Well, unless you work in the military-industrial complex, that is.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
A beautiful picture book with an intriguing mechanic that devolves into flavourless surface-level commentary of consent, character, and childlike curiosities. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p data-characters="344" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you’ve gotten a bit of headway into <em>Hades 2</em>, you’ll come across the Fated List, which has a huge list of challenges to complete. These range from using one of every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-boons-for-the-moonstone-axe-in-hades-2/">Daedalus Hammer Boon</a> for a weapon to killing a certain amount of enemies a specific way. They’re like achievements, only you get more than bragging rights. </p> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="192" data-injectable="false">One such Fated List item is confusing, even for those like me who’ve put a few dozen hours into the game. Here’s whether you can locate the Three Fates in the <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access.</p> <h2 id="h-can-you-speak-to-the-three-fates-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">Can you speak to the Three Fates in Hades 2?</h2> <figure data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">As of writing, the Three Fates have not been added to <em>Hades 2, </em>so this Fated List option is impossible to complete. No matter how much you scour any<em> </em>region or try to beat the final boss, the Three Fates will not appear to you. The closest you can currently get to them is speaking to Lord Moros, provided you’ve progressed enough to have him appear and hang out in the Crossroads next to the Fated List.</p>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="false">While this is pure speculation (and spoiler territory, for those who aren’t far enough in the game), the Three Fates will likely be somewhere in the House of Hades at the end of a run. It’s mentioned several times that Chronos has managed to capture the Three Fates so it’d make sense he’d keep a group that powerful close to his home. Specifics are a little up in the air, but they may be in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-is-zagreus-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zagreus’s room</a> since that’s where you head after defeating Chronos.</p>

<p data-characters="336" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">From November 2023 until now, <em>Warzone</em> has already had several major updates, adding new limited-time game modes, maps, weapons, operator skins, and more. And while there’s only a few months to go before the next installment in the series debuts, Raven Software still has plenty of new events and weekly rotations in the pipeline. </p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false"> It’s a lot to keep up with. So, to help parse the packed schedule ahead, here’s our <em>Warzone</em> event calendar for ongoing and upcoming updates, seasonal events, and playlists in 2024. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Warzone schedule: Event and seasonal activities for 2024</h2> <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Not every <em>Warzone</em> update entails a playlist or map shakeup. Instead, these are the crossovers and special events Raven Software holds for the shooter. </p> <p data-characters="22" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false"><strong>Ongoing events in 2024</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-challenges-and-rewards-in-mw3-and-warzone-u-assist-veterans-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U Assist Veterans</a> [May 8 – May 22]</li> </ul>

In 2023, the first stage of WSOW qualifiers was held at the end of April. After qualifiers, the WSOW runs through the rest of the summer, meaning there will be plenty of action to tune into soon. For updates on the competition, fans can follow the <em>Call of Duty</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/cod_esports?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esports Twitter account</a>. </p>
 <h2 id="h-playlist-rotations-schedule-2024" data-injectable="false">Playlist rotations schedule 2024 </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">Raven Software&nbsp;releases a new playlist every Wednesday with different modes,&nbsp;maps, and squad sizes.&nbsp;As of writing, the battle royale currently has two maps that support standard matches and four Resurgence maps. With so many environments, there is always a chance that a player’s preferred map or squad size isn’t available on a given week. </p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Ever since <em>Warzone</em> introduced Ranked Play to Resurgence, players started to wonder when the game mode would also be added to Urzikstan. After six months of waiting, Treyarch has still not provided an update, leaving some to wonder if we will ever see it. </p> <p data-characters="91" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here is everything you need to know about the upcoming playlist updates.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">May 15-22</h3> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Plunder: </strong>Urzikstan Quads </li> <li><strong>Ranked Play: </strong>Rebirth Island Trios </li> <li><strong>Battle Royale: </strong>Urzikstan Solos, Duos, Trios, Quads </li> <li><strong>Resurgence: </strong>Map Rotation Solos, and Duos or Rebirth Island Quads </li> <li><strong>Loaded Resurgence: </strong>Rebirth Island Trios </li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Warzone</em> new map schedule for 2024</h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">So far in 2024, <em>Warzone</em> has already added two new Resurgence maps. It’s unclear if the devs have any plans to add any new maps before the next title, but some players expect a new large battle royale map after seeing back-to-back smaller environments. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Current <em>Warzone</em> maps </h3> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="false"> <li>Urzikstan </li> <li>Rebirth Island </li> <li>Fortune’s Keep </li> <li>Vondel</li> <li>Ashika Island </li> </ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Bungie is doing a huge pass on weapons in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> when its next expansion, The Final Shape, releases on June 4. The balance tweaks include a blanket buff to just about all weapons in PvE activities, as well as an adjustment to Divinity--a gun that's essential in lots of high-level play situations--that will probably make it a little more annoying to use.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer dropped an expansive set of details about how weapons are set to change <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">on its website</a>. The big change players are likely to feel immediately is a buff to all weapons against enemies in different activities. That's the result of Bungie removing weapon "spec" mods that give you bonuses to certain kinds of enemies, like minor rank-and-file baddies or bosses. Instead of letting you spec for damage against a specific type of foe, Bungie is boosting the base damage of all your guns against all types of foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's Bungie's rundown of how things are changing:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased base PvE damage versus all combatants</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pulse Rifles: 20%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode. (These both have an intrinsic PvE damage buff built in.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Pellet Shotguns: 10%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Conditional Finality, and The Fourth Horseman. (These are all already performing as intended.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Slug Shotguns: 9%</li><li dir="ltr">Fusion Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: One Thousand Voices. (This one was just buffed.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Sniper Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike's storm. (These are both performing well.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Glaive projectiles: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Linear Fusion Rifles: 5%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Minors (red bars)--this stacks with the base PvE damage increase</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sidearms, Trace Rifles, Scout Rifles, and Bows: 20%</li><li dir="ltr">Auto Rifles and Pulse Rifles: 15%  <ul><li dir="ltr">For Pulse Rifles, this is in addition to the above buff, and Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode are included.  <ul><li dir="ltr">I.e. Pulse Rifles will do 1.2 * 1.15 = 38% more damage to red bars.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Submachine Guns: 10%</li><li dir="ltr">Hand Cannons: 5%</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Majors (orange bars)</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Trace Rifles: 20%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage globally, including PvP</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Machine Guns: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Swords: 7%</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Bungie is also making more granular adjustments to various Exotic weapons, depending on how they perform in their designed roles and how players are using them. That mostly means that underperforming guns are getting a boost--but a few, like Divinity, are getting adjustments in the other direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Divinity is a trace rifle that helps teams out by creating a big critical hit spot on enemies, making it pretty crucial in some high-level activities. The trouble is, Divinity lets you get around the intended mechanics of a lot of fights, and it's so useful that it's basically required in certain battles, especially against enemies that move around a lot and are tough to hit. What's more, players have gotten pretty good at using Divinity as effectively as possible by "feathering" their trigger pulls to make ammo last as long as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie isn't changing how Divinity or feathering the trigger work on principle, but it is adjusting the effectiveness of the gun so that it takes longer to create the critical hit spot on an enemy. Divinity will be less efficient and the beam won't last as long, even if you're feathering the trigger, which means it'll be a little less reliable in tough content.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other Exotics and their perks are getting adjusted, mostly to make them more useful in PvE. Dead Man's Tale, Truth, Queensbreaker, The Colony, and Touch of Malice are all getting adjustments and tweaks that'll make them function better against various enemies. Osteo Striga, on the other hand, will be quite a bit less deadly--the poison-spreading submachine gun will now get a four-second cooldown on its poison effect, so you won't be able to blanket a room in infectious death just by killing a few weak enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">That will hopefully have the effect of making more of your guns useful across a greater number of activities. You can check out the full list of adjustments on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">Bungie's website</a>.</p>
