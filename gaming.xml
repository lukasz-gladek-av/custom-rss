			<p>Paul Walter Hauser, an actor who you probably know from the Apple TV+ series Black Bird, has joined Zach Creggar's upcoming Resident Evil movie, according to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/paul-walter-hauser-austin-abrams-resident-evil-zach-cregger-1236546153/">Deadline</a>. Creggar co-wrote the film with John Wick writer Shay Hatten, and he'll also be directing it following his critical hit from this year, Weapons.</p>



<p>Hauser is the second actor to publicly join the project, after Wolfs actor Austin Abrams was reported to be taking part in the <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-austin-abrams-zach-cregger-1236346563/">film earlier this year.</a> The new movie is due to arrive on September 18, 2026, though at the time of this writing we don't have a strong idea as to what the plot of the film will be, or who else will be joining Hauser and Abrams in the cast.</p>



<p>What we do know about the story, according to what Creggar told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/zach-cregger-interview-resident-evil-weapons">Inverse</a> in an interview, is that is won't be a Leon Kennedy-based story. Creggar is looking to tell "<em>a different story</em>" compared to the games, but doesn't want fans to be concerned that his film won't be a Resident Evil story.</p>



<p>"<em>It is obedient to the lore of the games, it’s just a different story</em>. <em>I’m not going to tell Leon’s story, because Leon’s story is told in the games. [Fans] already have that.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Let me say this: this is not breaking the rules of the games</em>. <em>I am the biggest worshiper of the games, so I’m telling a story that is a love letter to the games and follows the rules of the games.</em>"</p>



<p>In other Resident Evil news, ahead of Creggar's film, fans of the series can look forward to Resident Evil Requiem arriving on <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">February 27, 2026</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-attracts-theme-park-sim-builder-review-early-access-aliens-steam-2000626562</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-theme-park-management-game-based-on-mars-attacks-is-here-and-it%E2%80%99s-good.1300872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, I didn’t have this on my 2025 bingo card, which is a thing I assume we all have. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-video-game-mars-attracts-theme-park-burton-1851629159">There’s a <em>Mars Attacks!</em> video game out this week on PC</a>, and more surprisingly, it’s a really fun, if somewhat rough around the edges, theme park management game that plays a lot like a sci-fi spin on <em>Zoo Tycoon</em> and <em>Two Point Hospital. </em></p> <p>Cleverly titled <em>Mars Attracts,</em> this newly released theme park management sim lets you abduct humans from throughout history and build a theme park around displaying them like animals while also experimenting on them in horrible ways for science. And also to provide entertainment to your depraved Martian guests. And after spending a few hours with <em>Mars Attracts,</em> I’m both excited to play more and also disturbed by how quickly I turned on humanity in the pursuit of building the coolest theme park on Mars.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mars-attracts"><em>Mars Attracts</em></a> isn’t based on the ’90s <em>Mars Attacks</em> movie directly, but instead is based on the original trading cards that inspired Tim Burton’s cult classic film, so don’t expect Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker to pop up at any point. Instead, <em>Mars Attracts</em> uses the OG card art and lore as its foundation to build out a wild theme park management simulator. And all of the new in-game art created for<em> Mars Attracts</em> is fantastic, perfectly emulating the old look of the cards. I really want some of these loading screen and pause menu images printed out as big posters.</p>

  <p>So what do you do in <em>Mars Attracts</em>? Well, you build theme parks. But it’s not as simple as plopping down some paths, food stalls, trash cans, and rides, and calling it a day. The Martians in <em>Mars Attracts</em> are coming to your park to see different human beings from various points in history, like the Wild West and Ancient Rome. Through the use of time travel and UFOs, you send off aliens to go collect humans and items from a given time period, which you then place in exhibits. And while you have some humans collected, you might as well run experiments on them. Not only does this please many of your guests, but it also helps you earn the various research currencies needed to unlock upgrades and new things to build. It’s a lot more fun than researching new tech in other park builders. In those games, I don’t even get to torture and kill one single human, let alone dozens.</p> <p>Of course, the humans you collect aren’t going to be happy about this situation, so you’ll need to make sure you keep their enclosure clean and filled with food troughs and water dispensers, and not poke and prod them too much. If a human gets too angry and wants to break out, they just might, and you’ll need to call in security to stop them.</p>

 <p>And if you have an excess of human beings, you can also just dissect them and use their parts to build new kiosks and entertainment options for your guests. Want to provide your Martians with balloons made out of human lungs? You can do just that, once you’ve killed enough humans. If this all sounds morbid and disgusting, don’t worry. <em>Mars Attracts</em> features a cartoonish and silly aesthetic that makes it easy to have a good time while torturing your human captives.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626566">©</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Mars Attracts</em> is currently in early access on Steam, and while I didn’t experience any annoying bugs or crashes while building out my incredible parks across the game’s first few starting zones, I did notice some missing text and a lack of sound effects. There’s just a general sense that the game isn’t finished yet, which is exactly what I would expect from an early access indie game. I also felt like some parts of the in-game economy felt grindy, and it can be annoying managing supplies when it feels like your workers aren’t doing what you expect. So if you prefer your games to be more feature-complete, perfectly balanced, and…well…finished, then you might want to wait.</p> <p>For everyone else, if you love building out wacky hospitals in <em>Two Point</em> or building elaborate parks in <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em>, I’d definitely recommend<em> Mars Attracts</em>. It’s the weirdest theme park builder I’ve played in a long time, but also a fantastic spin on the genre that sci-fi fans and <em>Mars Attacks</em> lovers will enjoy for hours and hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve put over 100 hours into Donkey Kong Bananza since July. I reached 100% completion on my first playthrough, did a zero-banana run on my second, and I’ve been using a third to practice crazy speedrun techniques and push DK’s incredible movement in more extreme ways. Two months after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">giving Bananza a 10 in my original review</a>, I remain in awe of how DK’s frenetic, destructive abilities work masterfully in tandem with the underground’s meticulously-designed breakable environments. Nintendo nailed the relationship between Bananza’s world and its main character, and the new DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC is a really fun excuse to keep experimenting in this playground in a remixed, more frantic way, even if a slight lack of content and a few minor issues keep it from reaching the same inspired heights as the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get too far into things, a quick note. Bananza’s DLC is only accessible after clearing the main story, and it acts as somewhat of an extended postgame. I’m not going to outright spoil Bananza here, but if you’re still drilling your way to the planet core and don’t want to know anything about it, you may want to come back to this review once you’ve reached the end credits. That said, you should also do so <em>before </em>you dive too far past them, because the DLC makes some helpful changes to the original endgame grind that you may want to know about. There are two intertwined halves of the DLC to discuss: DK Island is a new level to explore, while Emerald Rush is a roguelite take on Bananza that makes up the majority of the content found in this combined package.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DK Island is a wonderful love letter to Rare’s Donkey Kong Country trilogy and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/11/25/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. It’s a nostalgic return to where DK platformers really began, comparable to exploring <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/09/26/super-mario-64">Super Mario 64</a>’s Mushroom Kingdom in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review">Super Mario Odyssey</a>’s postgame. It’s overflowing with great references, from obvious ones like DK’s treehouse and King K. Rool’s Gangplank Galleon from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/02/20/donkey-kong-country-review">Donkey Kong Country</a>, to deeper cuts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/05/29/donkey-kong-country-2-review">DKC 2</a>’s goal target tucked away in the corner on the ship’s main deck. As a huge fan of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/12/donkey-kong-jungle-beat">Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</a> – the last DK platformer Nintendo developed internally prior to Bananza – my favorite part of DK Island has to be the bongos out at sea. There are so many more references to DK history I don’t want to give away, but if you have any love for this series, you’ll probably get a kick out of discovering all its easter eggs too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, though, there’s actually not that much to do on DK Island. There are no Banandium Gems or fossils to hunt down and no challenge rooms to conquer. Instead, the gold bonus stages found in Bananza’s main layers are all collected here, making DK Island a convenient place to grind for cash. Bananza’s original postgame sees Grumpy Kong demanding tens of thousands of gold pieces to unlock some of the final collectibles and reach 100% completion, and those who have access to DK Island will have a much easier time grinding than I did before the DLC was out. Elsewhere, DK’s old parrot companion Squawks is here, and he will hunt down one of DK Island’s dozens of collectible statues in exchange for Banandium Chips. Shiny replicas of Bananza’s allies, enemies, and Kongs live in galleries across DK Island, adding to its value as a nostalgic DK history museum. In classic Bananza fashion, you can pick them up, turf surf on them, and use them to carve through the island’s central mountain. You’ll need to grind thousands of Banandium Chips to buy them all, but thankfully, those are the main reward of the Emerald Rush mode. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>DK Island is a rush of nostalgia, but there's actually not that much to do.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides DK Island’s role as a rush of 90s nostalgia and a place to store cool trinkets, there’s not much to it, and I wouldn’t recommend buying the DLC if you’re only interested in this component. It’s a little<em> </em>odd that DK Island wasn’t included as a postgame reward in the base game since it’s so comparable to Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom, and gating it behind paid DLC feels kind of like a money-hungry move from Nintendo. This is the company that just charged $10 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-review">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, though, so I guess I shouldn’t be too surprised at this somewhat eyeroll-worthy choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Bananza’s DLC does a much better job justifying its $20 price tag in its Emerald Rush mode. Void Kong has found his way to DK Island, and he’s moved on from his obsession with Banandium Gold to set his sights on a new prize: emerald ore… which is the exact same, but green. Void hires DK and Pauline to collect as much emerald ore as possible, and this introduction includes some cute followups and resolutions for Bananza’s main story and characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve seen some online chatter calling Emerald Rush a simple minigame that should have been free, but it’s much more than that: it’s a fully-featured side mode that turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a fun, replayable roguelite. Each run takes place across a series of rounds – ranging from six to 15 depending on the difficulty level selected – where you have 100 seconds to reach a quota of emerald ore to pay Void. If you don’t reach the goal, your run comes to an end right there. If you do, you can keep working on your build for the rest of the timer to stock up for the next round, where the quota progressively multiples. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island and Emerald Rush DLC Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Emerald Rush feels like a combination of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>’s Salmon Run and Side Order modes. Personality-wise, it clearly takes inspiration from Salmon Run: both feature a hilariously mean boss screaming at you to meet your quota through a walkie talkie over increasingly difficult rounds. This is also Nintendo’s first take on a roguelite since last year’s excellent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-review">Side Order DLC for Splatoon 3</a> which, notably, also came bundled with a nostalgic hub to explore. It feels like Donkey Kong is following the exact same playbook, as Emerald Rush features dozens of perks that impact your score multiplier in a very similar fashion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each run of Emerald Rush begins by stripping DK of all his skills – including his five Bananza transformations at higher difficulties – and it’s up to you to power him back up while also gathering piles of emerald ore. This is done by frantically exploring layers, fast traveling around with a limited number of barrel cannons, collecting emerald bananas and fossils that restore DK’s skills and give you the choice of one of three perks, and completing goals Void Kong assigns you at specific locations across the map. I love starting from nothing, giving me a place to put all of DK’s high-level base techniques to use, and I found I was able to reach a lot of areas in really cool, satisfying ways – for example, using a chunk to essentially quadruple jump to a platform I traditionally would have used Ostrich Bananza to reach. Emerald Rush challenges advanced players to go for the highest score possible, and there’s always room to grow by deepening your understanding of how DK moves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Emerald Rush turns Bananza’s destruction-based platforming into a frantic, replayable roguelite.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But even if you’re not interested in crazy parkour tricks, the most important part of Emerald Rush are the perks that alter how much emerald ore appears. There are generic power-ups like generating more when defeating a certain type of enemy, but the most exciting ways to score are the Groove subset of perks, which revolve around multipliers that increase the more you perform a specific action. For instance, my favorite is Turf Groove, where more emerald ore appears based on the total distance traveled by Turf Surfing. The second this perk shows up, my whole playstyle changes. Suddenly, I’m trying to get everywhere by Turf Surfing, which is a big challenge on denser layers. Emerald Rush leads to scenarios you’d never see in the base game, and with such an incredible foundation to build a roguelite on, it’s always fun seeing how you can push the mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking multiple perks like this on top of each other can lead to completely busted results, and I scored well over one million points on a few runs where my target goal was less than half that. If you thought the base game had a lot happening on-screen at once, Emerald Rush achieves a new level of unregulated chaos, like one run where I got tons of bonus emerald ore for defeating enemies as Zebra Bananza, leading to 30 minutes of sprinting around nonstop, destroying everything in sight to flood the screen with an overwhelming, borderline unbelievable amount of emerald ore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not always a breeze, though. Like most roguelites, a lot of your success depends on what skills randomly show up, and I lost multiple runs by banking on a certain Bananza to spawn by building my perks around it, and ultimately failing when it never arrived. Speaking of Bananzas, Emerald Rush really rewards mastery over these five powered-up forms, as knowing the best way to take advantage of their unique strengths and swapping between them on the fly results in a high skill ceiling fitting of an endgame mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish Emerald Rush went a little bit further with its abilities, though. Seeing big numbers get bigger is always enjoyable, and the way Emerald Rush overlays your multiplier onto every individual explosion is a nice touch – but with a few rare exceptions, there are no brand new abilities to find, and the perks simply make DK’s already-existing moves worth more points. It changes the scoring and the way you play, but beyond reclaiming powers I’m already very used to using in the base game, it never meaningfully expands the options available to you. The best roguelites make you feel more powerful throughout a run by giving you fresh moves as you go, and adding more exciting techniques to DK’s toolkit could have elevated this from a good roguelite mode to a great one.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation. New content is all that counts, so the enhanced editions of the Zeldas aren't included.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing runs earns you piles of Banandium Chips and rating points that unlock cute bonus costumes, more powerful perks in the rotation, and new layers to tackle. Emerald Rush doesn’t take place in new areas besides DK Island. Instead, DK and Pauline return to familiar locations from Bananza’s campaign, and one of the coolest parts of this mode is how it rewards you for being intimately familiar with these layers. Emerald versions of Banandium Gems and fossils are found in the same locations as their counterparts in the main campaign, and knowing exactly where to find a vein of three fossils or a bunch of bananas makes Emerald Rush feel like a cool B-side to the main story. And, the Getaways you’ve built during the main story become essential fast travel points during a run, further incentivizing you to explore each layer to the fullest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In that same vein, Void Kong’s objective will sometimes vaguely order you to do something like give Cranky Kong a high five, or take a swim in a layer that doesn’t have much water in it. Unlike the usual orders, these objectives don’t place a marker on your map, leaving it up to you to find them on your own. Thanks to my 100+ hours and multiple playthroughs, it didn’t take long for me to pinpoint Cranky hanging out on a big tree branch in the Forest Layer, or to find a quick pond to dive into in the Hilltop Layer. I initially thought reusing areas from the base game would be a weakness of Emerald Rush, but the way it leverages your knowledge of familiar locations is a really smart, novel way to effectively reuse old content.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this is another place I wish Emerald Rush had added a little bit extra to keep things fresh. There are no new enemy types, and it never introduces boss encounters that could’ve nicely broken up the pace of runs that last up to 45 minutes. I reached the end credits after about six hours, and while the DLC’s postgame opens up several more layers to play Emerald Rush in, I’m starting to feel a little burnt out on the formula. I’ll probably only stick around to reach 100% completion out of obligation to the base game I’ve so thoroughly completed. And when I do return, I’ll almost certainly throw on my own music or a podcast – the pair of main themes is undeniably catchy with flourishes from Pauline that change depending on your active transformation, but I could definitely go without hearing either for a while after 10 hours in the DLC. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">The best part about Donkey Kong Bananza’s DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC is that it gives me a reason to keep experimenting in one of my favorite playgrounds Nintendo has ever created. DK Island is a nostalgic rush that prioritizes fun callbacks to Rare’s golden era over stuff to actually do. Despite the warm, fuzzy feelings I had while exploring, I can’t help but think this would have been more fitting as a final postgame reward in Bananza itself rather than DLC locked behind a paywall. But the bulk of this expansion is housed in Emerald Rush, which let me unleash DK’s craziest parkour possibilities and strategically balance each transformation’s strengths to set new high scores. Its perk system creates unique ways to play you’d never consider in the original campaign, and it smartly returns to old locations and tests your knowledge of important places in a way that feels like a fitting endgame counterpart to the main story. That said, I wish Emerald Rush had introduced more new abilities and enemies to keep me around a bit longer than the 10 hours I’ve put in so far. If you’re hungry for more DK and aren’t opposed to a remixed, roguelite formula, Emerald Rush is probably worth the additional investment. Otherwise, Bananza’s DLC is an enjoyable but inessential expansion to DK and Pauline’s grand adventure.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>James Comer, a Republican representative from Kentucky and the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has called on the CEOs of major game-adjacent and forum platforms to appear at an upcoming panel about online radicalization. Coming in the aftermath of the murder of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, Comer seeks testimony from the leadership at Valve, Discord, Twitch, and Reddit.</p><p>In a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Comer stated that government has a "duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence." Comer further explained that the CEOs must "explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purpose."</p><p>As such, the CEOs have each been sent letters requesting their presence at a House Oversight Committee hearing that will take place on October 8. According to the letters, the hearing will address "radicalization of online forum users, including incidents of open incitement to commit violent politically motivated acts."</p><p>Information released about the suspect in Kirk's murder suggests that he was an avid internet user and game player. In addition to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/17/charlie-kirk-suspect-online-memes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">engraving references to online memes</a> and, apparently, a Helldivers 2 button combination on shell casings, the suspect also extensively used Discord, had a Steam account, and was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/technology/charlie-kirk-meta-x-tiktok.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as "terminally online" by friends.</a> These pieces of evidence, combined with debate around online response in the immediate aftermath, have resulted in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/15/kirk-social-media-gop-trump-tiktok-meta-x-censorship-00564655" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">calls from conservative officials and media</a> to crack down on social media companies.</p><p>However, an existing research community already exists that has attempted to tease out the complex, sensitive, and multifaceted relationship between gaming cultures and communities and violent radicalization. In recent years, researchers (including myself) have devoted time and attention to studying gaming cultures and communities. Sparked by high-profile violent attacks whose perpetrators referenced gaming culture or were radicalized within games-adjacent social media, this research has focused on how socialization and relationship-building within the context of online games may interact with radicalization to violent extremism. For instance, I have worked for years with collaborators to investigate <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1410620/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how often game players are exposed to hate speech and harassment</a> within games, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1586566/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">niche communities of violent extremists on Steam</a>, and methods for <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1537492/full" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">building resilience to radicalization among game communities</a>.</p><p>This research community has long been careful to focus on cultural and social dynamics and where they intersect with gaming broadly, and to communicate that there is little evidence of any direct link between gaming and violence. Video games are commonly targeted by influencers and policymakers after violent events, despite scant evidence as to a direct link between gameplay and violence. Social scientists have studied the effects of gaming since the 1990s and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owxk7LMzUSQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have found mixed results</a>, at most, for the controversial claims around games and violence.</p><p>Despite this caution and its focus on understanding exactly when, why, and whether violence in online communities occurs in gaming contexts, this research community has been significantly curtailed by recent initiatives by the current US administration. Much of my research, for instance, was funded by the Department of Homeland Security's Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention grant program, which was <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/120328/undoing-post-911-security-architecture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">significantly scaled back in July</a>. Other violence prevention research was funded by the National Institute for Health, which has also <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02721-5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">undergone severe cuts to its grantmaking efforts</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman James Comer is summoning the CEOS of Discord, Steam, Twitch and Reddit to Washington. A full committee hearing is scheduled for Oct. 8, at which Comer and the committee will ask Discord CEO Humam Sakhnini, Valve president and cofounder Gabe Newell, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman “explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes,” <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per a press release published on Wednesday</a>.</p><p>The hearing “will examine the radicalization of online forum users, including instances of open incitement to commit politically motivated acts,” per the release, in the wake of what Comer described as “the politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk.” Alongside the news release, the committee published the four separate letters it sent to each of the company’s leaders. At the hearing, each person will be able to give a five-minute opening statement before answering questions from committee members.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to the four companies for confirmation of their CEOs’ attendance.&nbsp;</p><p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the shooting death of Charlie Kirk, allegedly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zkxy2xmno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confessed to the crimes on Discord</a> in a private chat with friends. In another chat, he joked about being the killer’s doppelganger. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/tyler-robinson-set-face-formal-charges-shooting-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI director Kash Patel said Tuesday</a> that the bureau is investigating members of the Discord servers; <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/charlie-kirk-suspect-discord-messages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord said</a> it found "no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Discord and other gaming platforms have been thrust into the spotlight as authorities and lawmakers attempt to decipher an extremely online culture they largely don’t understand. Robinson reportedly etched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes and references to video game culture </a>into the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/politics/kirk-shooting-suspect-motive-messages.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullets </a>he prepared for the shooting: “Hey Fascist! Catch!” followed by a series of arrows that appears to reference a stratagem code in <em>Helldivers 2</em>; “Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,” a copypasta parodying furry culture; “Bella ciao,” the title of an anti-fasict Italian folk song popularized by video games and a Netflix series; and “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao.” The messages inscribed on these bullets are shitposts and extremely online in-jokes, something Robinson even admitted to in a text message exchange quoted in <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26098820/robinson-indictment.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">court documents</a> published this week: “The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulge uwu’ on fox new I might have a stroke.”</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Utah governor Spencer Cox described Robinson</a> as a person who was involved in “deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep.” He also said “clearly there was a lot of gaming going on.” Friends described Robinson as “very, very big into gaming,” like lots of people are.</p><p>Gaming and gaming-related platforms like Steam, Discord, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-profitable-layoffs-interview-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a> are used by millions of people daily, largely by <a href="https://aftermath.site/infinity-nikki-bubble-season-1-5-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people commiserating about their favorite games’ latest bad update</a>, organizing gaming sessions, and sharing sometimes incomprehensible memes. That’s not to say that these platforms don’t have a problem with radicalization; <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/far-right-took-over-steam-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report published in 2021</a> found that Steam, Discord, and Twitch hosted extremist activity that ranged from “racially abusive livestreams to open support for neo-Nazi terrorists.” In 2022, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/senator-asks-gabe-newell-why-steam-hosts-so-much-neo-nazi-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Hampshire senator Maggie Hassan wrote an open letter</a> to Newell asking about its moderation of extremist content.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, a mass shooting in a Buffalo grocery store was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/15/business/twitch-livestream-buffalo-massacre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broadcast</a> live on Twitch. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49998284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A German synagogue attack was livestreamed</a> on the platform in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, seven lawmakers <a href="https://kotaku.com/congress-extremism-harassment-ea-playstation-xbox-riot-1849901765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attempted to grill game makers</a> on their role in extremism and harassment in online spaces in a letter addressed to executives of Activision Blizzard, Roblox, Take-Two Interactive, Epic Games, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Innersloth, and others. Very little came of the letter; <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-171a384a-6013-4a04-a3d7-ef4d7c69513e.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">U.S. Congresswoman Lori Trahan told Axios in 2023</a> that she was “disappointed that the majority of companies [that responded] failed to address some of our most urgent questions, including providing us with their policies around extremism, as well as transparency reporting around the topic.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-unions-microsoft-layoffs-mmo-elder-scrolls"><h3>Months After Microsoft Layoffs, Zenimax Unions Never Stopped Fighting For Impacted Workers</h3></a><p>They won more time at the company, improved severance, recall rights, and saved a few jobs</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

      </div>
<p>Also on display in the video above is Battlefield 6's brand-new mode, Escalation. A spin on Conquest, Escalation has players capturing zones to fill a meter, and once it's full, a team earns one point--the meter then resets. The goal is earn three points to win a match. The twist is that when a team earns a point, some of the objectives on the map are eliminated, meaning the capture points teams are fighting over get smaller and smaller, thereby ... escalating the action.</p><p>Another large-scale map is <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Operation_Firestorm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Operation Firestorm</a>, and it's a new version of the fan-favorite map of the same name from Battlefield 3. It's set in an oil field and you can see it in action in the video below.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1505502047" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>A new patch for Sloclap's action football sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> just landed in beta, and with it comes a host of changes--including cross-play so you can kick balls with (or at) your friends on other platforms.</p><p>The French developer <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/season-1-update-1-201-000-tentative-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced the new update</a> on September 17. Taking to the game's official website, Sloclap said Patch 1.201.000, which is Rematch's season one update, goes into beta on the same day, with the full release tentatively scheduled for September 23. Although one of the headlining features is the addition of cross-platform play, the team also highlighted the "long-awaited" 3v3 ranked mode, alongside new cosmetics, customization options, and quality-of-life adjustments.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Some of these adjustments include making goalkeeper dives "more reliable," nerfing certain exploits, and improving player responsiveness across the board.</p><p>There's also a new technology, dubbed Network Next, which should reduce the latency for players with high ping. It's currently only available in the São Paulo server region for now, but the team is looking at implementing the feature in more regions in the future.</p><p>Of course, considering this update is in beta, Sloclap made it clear that the patch notes you'll read at the bottom of this article are "tentative" and may change between now and September 23.</p><p>GameSpot gave Rematch--the latest, non-martial arts effort from Sloclap--a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/" data-ref-id="1900-6418378">7/10 in our official review</a>. Critic Richard Wakeling said the game could be "something special" if the team could sand off its rough edges.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, Paradox Interactive admitted its original mistake and announced that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will include all playable vampire clans in the base version. At Gamescom 2025, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Toreador and Lasombra clans would only be available as part of the Premium Edition or, separately, through a $21.99 DLC. Needless to say, this caused a massive backlash from fans, eventually forcing Paradox to rework the plan.</p>



<p>Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing. We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, the Premium Edition will include, in addition to the already announced Santa Monica Memories cosmetic pack that hearkens back to the original game, two upcoming story DLCs. The first, titled Loose Cannon, follows Brujah Sheriff Benny's brutal perspective, letting players experience his story of relentless pursuit. When Loose Cannon launches, players with the Premium Edition will also unlock a Benny-inspired outfit for Phyre. Loose Cannon launches in Q2 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The second DLC is called The Flower &amp; the Flame and follows Toreador Primogen Ysabella’s legendary path to creating her dark magnum opus. Players who own The Flower &amp; the Flame will also get a Ysabella-inspired outfit for Phyre when the story pack launches. The Flower &amp; the Flame launches in Q3 2026 and can be purchased separately for $14.99/£12.99/€14.99. The Expansion Pass can be purchased separately on October 21, 2025, for $34.99/£28.99/€34.99.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will also offer a physical Premium Edition priced at $89.99/£74.99/€89.99. Created with PLAION, it will include the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox pre-order bonus, the Expansion Pass, five character cards, a journal, and a Steelbook case, all packaged in a premium box.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span id="follow-author-standard_article_details-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></p> <p><span>is an editor covering deals and gaming hardware that he thinks you’ll like. He joined in 2018, and after a stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Logitech’s next flagship wireless gaming mouse is ditching mechanical switches for an analog system equipped with haptics actuators to simulate the feeling of a click. The mouse is called the Pro X2 Superstrike, and it’s coming early next year for $179.99.</p><p>The inductive analog system (which Logitech calls Haptic Inductive Trigger System, or HITS) boasts a small 0.6mm travel per main button. They’re supposed to let players click faster than ever thanks to their low latency — Logitech claims it improves latency by up to 30 milliseconds — plus 10 customizable actuation points, and rapid trigger support.</p><p>Rapid trigger is more commonly found in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668234/wooting-60he-v2-keyboard-announcement-release-date">gaming keyboards</a>, but now it’s coming to mice. The simple explanation is that it allows the sensor to reset when you barely lift up on the button, letting it quickly register another input with minimal force. It allows you take action faster than those using mice that lack rapid trigger. This mouse supports five rapid trigger reset points, configurable via G Hub, letting you get super granular with when you want the analog sensor to reset.</p><p>The Superstrike weighs 65 grams, and features Logitech’s Hero 2 sensor, which is also present in its current lineup of Pro X wireless gaming mice. It supports up to an 8,000Hz polling rate wirelessly via its included Lightspeed USB-A dongle, although it’s only accessible via the G Hub software. I’m generally skeptical of 8,000Hz polling rates since most people’s reaction time isn’t fast enough to warrant it, but I’m curious if it’ll make a noticeable difference in conjunction with the Superstrike’s rapid trigger functionality.</p><p>Logitech is also announcing the Superlight 2C, a more compact version of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23043644/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-gaming-mouse-price-release-date-specs">Superlight 2 mouse</a>. It’s 10 percent lighter at 51 grams and five percent smaller overall, which could make it a preferred choice among PC gamers whose hands don’t jibe with the size of most gaming mice. Other than its shape, its specs seem identical to the Superlight 2. It’ll be available on October 21st for $159.99.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778722/logitech-pro-x2-superstrike-superlight-wireless-haptics-rapid-trigger-gaming-mouse-pc#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/778722/logitech-pro-x2-superstrike-superlight-wireless-haptics-rapid-trigger-gaming-mouse-pc]]></content:encoded>

It launches October 8th for $179.99.</p><p>The A20 X ships with a transmitter called the Playsync Base that can receive audio inputs via USB from two platforms. When you press the button on the back of the headset’s right ear cup, a subtle LED light on the transmitter will jump between sources, lit to indicate where your audio is currently coming from.</p><p>The execution here isn’t too different from what I’ve seen in other — typically pricier — gaming headsets, namely some of Astro’s own. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Astro-Wireless-Headset-Xbox/dp/B0BRXJDQC1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$399 A50 X</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Omni-Platform-Wireless-Headset-Station/dp/B0DB7ZW7J4?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$299 A50 Gen 5</a> both allow easy audio switching for two consoles (the A50 X also includes video switching via two HDMI-in ports), as do SteelSeries’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$300-ish Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a> and its <a href="http://amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZW52XSQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$180-ish wired</a> counterpart. All of these solutions make it so you don’t have to leave your chair to swap audio sources. This one just so happens to be the most affordable wireless option that I’ve seen that supports Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC in one model, even if $179.99 still isn’t cheap.</p><p>The A20 X has other hardware staples we expect to see, like a dedicated two-button rocker for adjusting the game and chat audio (it’s on the opposite ear cup from the volume rocker, so as to avoid confusion). It has a flexible, detachable boom microphone, a mute button, and Bluetooth 5.3 compatibility with phones and other mobile devices. However, its Bluetooth support doesn’t include concurrent wireless connections; it’s one or the other.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/776006/astro-a20x-headset-switch-ps5-xbox-price-features#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/776006/astro-a20x-headset-switch-ps5-xbox-price-features]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The race to define what the brutal murder of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk last week means and why it happened has led a lot of people to say a lot of things. Some of those things, like blaming the sci-fi shooter <em>Halo</em> for fomenting class warfare, or suggesting the alleged shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746">radicalized by the “meme-ification” of the internet</a>, look increasingly like absurd, knee-jerk, and ill-informed reactions, as a recent report about the actual contents of one of the gaming Discord servers the suspect was active on suggests none of that.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/"><em>The Washington Post</em> reported</a> that alleged gunman Tyler Robinson had admitted to the crime in a Discord message to friends last week. Yesterday, independent <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">reporter Ken Klippenstein shared actual screenshots</a> of messages allegedly posted on the server, alongside an interview with some of its other members. According to his report, the Discord hangout was far from the hotbed of political radicalization some politicians and pundits have claimed it would be.</p> <p>According to Klippenstein, there were only a couple of mentions of either President Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden in the chat logs, and those were apolitical mentions of recent news events. “Cat memes, weather updates, home improvement and the odd Garfield reference populate Robinson’s posts,” Klippenstein writes.</p>

 <p>“Obviously he’s okay with gay and trans people having a right to exist, but also believes in the Second Amendment,” an apparent childhood friend of Robinson’s told Klippenstein.&nbsp;“To all of us he just seemed like a simple guy who liked playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Helldivers 2</em>, loved to fish and loved to camp…it really did seem like that’s all he was about.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨 BREAKING NEWS: CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit have been called to testify in front of Congress.</p> <p>They will answer to the American people how their platforms have been used by RADICALS to advance POLITICAL VIOLENCE, including the assassination of Charlie Kirk. <a href="https://t.co/bNbgqSLeNq">pic.twitter.com/bNbgqSLeNq</a></p> <p>— Oversight Committee (@GOPoversight) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPoversight/status/1968328735108800739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This lack of an easily applicable, ready-made narrative about Kirk’s alleged murderer that would paint him has a politically aggrieved radical comes as those leading the national conversation, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/kash-patel-testimony-senate-judiciary-charlie-kirk-assassination/">like FBI Director Kash Patel</a>, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/charlie-kirk-conspiracy-theories-roil-maga-media-groyper">rush to ascribe motives</a>. “[Gaming] can desensitize to the point where that person involved in these games looks at other people…and they’re not even human beings, they’re simply avatars,” former FBI profiler Dr. Mary Ellen O’Toole <a href="https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1967419550817042749">told Fox News this week</a>.</p>

 <p>According to charging documents filed by Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday, Robinson told his roommate in text messages that he allegedly killed Kirk because “I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out.” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis">The prosecution’s evidence suggests</a> Robinson may have targeted Kirk specifically over transphobic comments he made in the past. But it also didn’t allude to any political radicalization fomented by online platforms like Discord and Reddit. That hasn’t stopped at least one high-profile politician from calling on the executives of those companies to testify before Congress about “the radicalization of online forum users.”</p> <p>“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>. “To prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.”</p> <p>The hearing is set to take place on October 8, 2025 and is the first time Discord in particular will have been called on to testify. Members of Tiktok, X, and Meta <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twitch+other+companies+called+testify+congress&amp;sca_esv=c6620bc555597255&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPkzG72RanLTFQQWJFtRCj0QoXIBg%3A1758129266918&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A9%2F3%2F2022%2Ccd_max%3A8%2F3%2F2025&amp;tbm=">were grilled last year</a> about online child safety concerns. A spokesperson for Discord has previously said there was “no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If the Battlefield series has ever been known for one thing, it’s the massive, chaotic scale of destruction that takes place in its largest multiplayer maps, and I got a wonderfully refreshing taste of just that when I dove into Battlefield 6’s upcoming 64-player game modes earlier this week. Mirak Valley, the biggest map available at launch, is a fantastic new warzone that reminds me a bit of a much bigger version of Blood Gulch from Halo, with two bases on each side battling it out in a massive, deadly no man’s land, while a remastered version of the iconic Operation Firestorm from Battlefield 3 made an appearance to kick me right in the nostalgia. Both were a literal blast to play, each in their own way, and it just felt so good to be back in large scale war games with bombs exploding and bullets flying every which way, especially with the environments being more destructible than ever and which alter the map in creative ways. Since I skipped Battlefield 2042, it’s been a good, long while since I felt the itch to play a military shooter with this kind of crazy player count, and after a few hours with Battlefield 6 I don’t know how I’ve managed to go so long without it. It feels good to be back!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">As I Walk Through the Valley…</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first map I played was Mirak Valley, which Battlefield Studios says will be the largest map at launch, and yeah, this thing’s pretty huge. Though it’s got small settlements and rocky terrain across long stretches of dirt road on each side, the main attraction are the two unfinished skyscrapers found in the center of the map where a lot of the action takes place. Battling in these claustrophobic concrete boxes and stairwells allows for plenty of close-quarters gunplay, but with unfinished walls all around you, it also leaves you exposed to the outside world to snipe you of launch a missile in your direction, which adds a unique challenge as you attempt to capture the all-important zones found in each of the buildings. And while the gradual destruction of these buildings can make them harder to control, they also allow for interesting opportunities to alter the geometry of the map, like how part of a destroyed building can fall down to create a ramp, which can then be used to reach the second floor of the skyscraper from the outside and make it much easier to navigate (but also harder to defend from would-be invaders).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6: Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mirak Valley ended up easily being my favorite of the two maps I played, both because it’s a fantastically well-designed and ridiculously large warzone to master, but also because of these moments where the new destruction engine makes itself so clearly known. For example, in one match I spent a lot of time in a small two-story building picking off the enemy from a distance and trying to remain hidden, but over the course of the match (and many deaths) the building I was in continued to lose pieces of itself until there was almost nothing left. The window I was shooting out of at the start became half of a wall absent a room, which then fell away as I retreated to a staircase, until there was almost none of the structure left by the end of the battle and I found myself peering out behind rubble to take my shots. Moments like that are an excellent showcasing of just how much mayhem you can cause over the course of the match, all of it which organically takes place over the course of battle instead of being pre-determined events that inevitably happen every match.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Into the Fire(storm)</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After not nearly enough time exploring (and blowing up) Mirak Valley, we moved on to more familiar terrain with the returning Battlefield 3 map of Operation Firestorm. If you’ve never played this one before, it takes place on an oil refinery with a big warehouse where you can get your fill of close-range encounters, or you can take the the labyrinth of metal stairs and walkways that is the refinery itself, complete with the unforgettable giant fuel tanks that explode in gobsmackingly beautiful fashion with a little provocation from the business end of your assault rifle. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The return of this map is sure to bring back fond memories of good times had and bitter rivals slain, but it was noticeable to me how some of the legacy map design choices didn’t exactly jive with modern day multiplayer expectations. To their credit, Battlefield Studios certainly made some adjustments to line of sight, destructible setpieces, and the available combat lanes you can use to take it to the bad guys, but they also had to keep a lot the same to make it recognizable as the map we know and love. That means there are plenty of barren areas you’ll have to run through, especially on the outskirts of the arena, where you’ll be wide open for someone to pick you off without much trouble or simply be a bit bored waiting to get to your destination with not much to do along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the virtues of this map are still as clear as ever, especially the long-range potential of the refinery’s elevated walkways, which are a sniper’s dream that I took full advantage of. Plus, being able to blow up key parts of the warehouse to do things like kill the prone enemies hidden on the rooftop by blasting away part of the ceiling and shooting them through it, is just *chef’s kiss*. It definitely didn’t click with me as much as the sparkly, new Mirak Valley though, especially since this Battlefield 3 throwback feels like such a tiny arena by comparison.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">On Target</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter which map I was on though, I was consistently impressed by how good Battlefield 6 felt, whether it was the customizable character classes, more grounded gunplay, or the handful of game modes that put my combat prowess to the test. Each of the four classes – Assault, Support, Recon, and Engineer – have their advantages that made it difficult to stick to any one, like how easy it was to get my teammates back in the fight with the support class, or how awesome it was to have sniper dummies to distract my enemies as the Recon class. One cool aspect though, is that I was able to swap out weapons I preferred with one class when I decided to change over, like how I gave my Assault character the Support character’s machine gun so I wouldn’t have to bother reloading in between kills (and because I tend to play more stationary than most and so didn’t mind the list accuracy). This felt like a nice middle ground between locking classes out of using the arsenal not natively a part of their class, since gadgets and unique abilities were still exclusive, but weapons could be freely traded, and I got a kick out of experimenting with different combinations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also really appreciated some of the adjustments to gunplay that made engagements a bit less goofy, like how accuracy with weapons is diminished while in motion, or especially when midair or jumping around. This meant I saw less of players bouncing up and down cartoonishly to kill me, which always feels out of place in a military shooter that’s aiming for some level of realism. Don’t get me wrong, there was still plenty of couch spamming and ducking in and out of corners to get shots off, and mastering mobility certainly plays a role in your ability to dominate the competition, but I also felt more rewarded for calming taking my shot against players scrambling around wildly to evade me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game modes we played on each map were variations of area control game types we’ve seen before and one new one that added a heavy helping of chaos. Conquest served as the classic game of maintaining control of as many key parts of the map as possible while scoring kills, while Breakthrough put one team on the offense to take control of specific regions of the warzone that the other team fought to defend. Escalation, on the other hand, has an interesting concept where throughout the match the capture points in play are gradually reduced, forcing conflict onto certain parts of the terrain that directs the flow of battle and reduces stalling. This made for absolute chaos as everyone rushed to certain areas for all-out warfare that usually just involved lots of tanks blowing everything to smithereens, and was maybe not as balanced as the more vanilla game modes, but damn if it didn’t make for a hilarious time.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-all-out-warfare-and-one-iconic-map-returns-and-it-rocks]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 stirred up controversy among fans for its DLC strategy, particularly in how it was locking away two of the game’s six vampire clans as launch-day DLC. Publisher Paradox Interactive and developer The Chinese Room have walked this back; the Lasombra and Toreador clans will be part of the base game at release.</p><p>Originally, the Lasombra and Toreador clans were going to be offered as DLC for $21.99 and as part of the $89.99 Premium Edition. Since this extra content would be available at launch, many fans, who were already upset that the sequel features significantly fewer clans than the 2004 original, became outraged by the presumption that content was being removed from Bloodlines 2 to be sold at an additional cost. While Paradox initially explained the move as purely a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-two-clans-locked-behind-dlc-because-of-business">business decision</a>, the backlash led to the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-want-to-do-this-right-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-issues-playstation-store-pre-order-refunds-as-publisher-works-to-make-big-changes-before-launch">issuing refunds</a> for those who pre-ordered the game on the PlayStation Store while promising significant changes would be made before Bloodlines 2's launch.&nbsp;</p><p>A new overview trailer running down the game’s base and post-launch content revealed the DLC adjustment includes a message in the video description by Bloodlines 2 executive producer and White Wolf executive vice president, Marco Behrmann. He addresses the DLC controversy by stating,</p><p>"Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing," said Behrmann. "We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Florida attorney general James Uthmeier has filed two lawsuits targeting companies that make, distribute, and process payments for porn video games. <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-files-complaints-against-pornography-websites-violating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uthmeier announced</a> on Monday that he’d filed lawsuits against both Lusty Heroes, which hosts a porn game of the same name, and its payment processor Segpay in one complaint and PornHub owner Aylo, which runs porn game platform Nutaku, in another.</p><p>Uthmeier claims in a news release that the companies are “openly violating Florida’s age verification law” that requires websites to ask users to verify their age using “a commercially reasonable method.”</p><p>These complaints <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/08/05/florida-porn-crackdown-age-checks-ignored-by-top-sites-ag-says/85522404007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">follow Uthmmeier’s first lawsuit against a porn website</a> that he says violates Florida’s age verification laws, which went into effect on Jan. 1.</p><p>“We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards.”</p><p>Aylo, which owns PornHub and Nutaku, said Nutaku (and a second website listed in the complaint, SpiceVids) comply with Florida’s laws, <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/15/florida-targets-porn-video-game-websites-under-child-safety-law/86167331007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a statement provided to the Tallahassee Democrat</a>. Aftermath has reached out to Aylo, Nutaku, <em>Lusty Heroes</em> distributor Gethins Limited, and payment processing company Segpay for comment. Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat that Nutaku’s games with explicit content “represent less than the statutory threshold,” meaning that it’s in compliance because the law doesn’t apply. The threshold in Florida is that the law applies to websites in which more than a third of its content is “harmful to minors,” <a href="https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Free Speech Coalition</a>.</p><p>Nutaku obviously has a lot of porn games, but as the Free Speech Coalition wrote, the laws are vague enough that it can be unclear what meets the threshold. “Whether ‘content’ is defined as bytes, images, web pages, video files, or something else entirely is likely to have to be decided by a court if/when a lawsuit is filed against a non-compliant site,” it wrote on its FAQ page about age verification laws.</p><p>"We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations in court," Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat. "These platforms are committed to ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. We look forward to presenting the facts through the appropriate legal process."</p><p>Uthmeier is looking for fines of up to $50,000 per violation in each case.</p><p>Nutaku is one of the more popular porn game platforms; as of 2020, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nutaku-50-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it announced it amassed more than 50 million users</a>. It uses a special currency when selling its games. Instead of buying directly, a customer purchases gold coins that are then used to buy games. To use a processor like PayPal or Apple Pay, <a href="https://www.nutaku.net/gold-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gold must be purchased <em>off</em> Nutaku, through a third-party site</a>. Nutaku hosts all sorts of free and paid games across genres. <em>Lusty Heroes</em>, on the other hand, is a singular browser game that is free to play. Segpay, which describes itself as “one of the most reputable adult payment processors,” is listed on the <em>Lusty Heroes</em> website as the “authorized sales agent for access to <a href="http://lustyheroes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lustyheroes.com</a>.” That is, presumably, why Uthmeier listed it in the <em>Lusty Heroes</em> complaint, though the exact connection beyond that is unclear; he says it “facilitates” the distribution of the game. Segpay is listed as a Florida business.</p><p>“SegPay has yet to be served with any formal complaint and maintains a policy of not commenting on pending or threatened litigation,” Corey D. Silverstein, who represents Segpay, told Aftermath.</p><p>More than 20 states now have laws requiring age verification for sites deemed to be harmful to minors, which has caused some websites, <a href="https://www.aylo.com/assets/files/age_verification_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like other porn websites</a> and social media platform BlueSky, <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/25/bluesky-blocks-access-mississippi-free-speech-privacy-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to block access in several states</a>. Credit card companies and payment processors have also played a major role in the censorship of adult content and games online, too, perhaps to head off litigation like the lawsuit now against Segpay. In July, <a href="https://aftermath.site/itch-io-nsfw-adult-content-remove-payment-processors-collective-shout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">independent video game platform Itch deindexed</a> most of its adult content and wholesale removed others after “scrutiny from [its] payment processors regarding the nature of some content.” Valve similarly had recently removed a bunch of games from its platform, too, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-introduces-new-rule-prohibiting-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-that-might-make-visa-or-mastercard-unhappy-financial-deplatforming-in-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">again citing regulations from payment processors, credit card companies, and banks</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/samuel-deats-anime-animation-horses-kiss-scene"><h3>What’s Harder To Draw: Horses Or Kisses?

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158868/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I've become so used to Nintendo taking its sweet time with DLC rollouts I assumed there was no way we'd get first-party add-ons within the first year of Switch 2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise</a>, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mario_kart_8_deluxe_booster_course_pass">Booster Course Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/splatoon_3_side_order">Side Order</a> were all pleasantly surprising, not because of their packed bonus content (though that was a welcome factor), but because I had given up hope of ever hearing from these games again. So, you can only imagine my surprise when Nintendo flung an image of DK and Pauline at me last week, accompanied by the words 'DLC' and 'Available Today'.</p>
<p>It has been a little over two months since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched on Switch 2, and the DLC is already here. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> expansion packs in a new area to explore <em>and</em> a ridiculously fun new game mode, but its proximity to the base game's arrival and a £16.99 / $19.99 price tag make it difficult to shake the feeling that this add-on content should have been included from the jump. In short, this banana is split.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158865/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's kick things off with the positives — because come on, could <em>you</em> be mean to DK's goofy little grin? I'll get to DK Island in just a moment, but the new Emerald Rush mode is undoubtedly the star of the show. What's more, it slaps.</p>
<p>This takes the basic movement and combat of Bananza and shapes it into a roguelike. Yes, a roguelike. It sounds like a bit of a square-peg-round-hole situation, no? Don't worry, I was of the same mind for a second too, but once I started barrelling around with a timer ticking away in the background, I quickly saw the two were a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>After the events of the main story (don't worry, I won't be spoiling too much here), big bad Void Kong finds himself chilling on the surface at DK Island — the one from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">64</a> et al. Putting his Banandium passions behind him, he ropes DK and Pauline into a new mining operation: Emerald Ore. Void has quotas to fill, and he wants to fill them fast, so our beloved platforming pair set out collecting as much of the damn stuff as possible.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158862/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not your typical roguelike set-up, but stay with me here. Void's initial quotas are simple enough to fill within the 99-second time limit, but as the pressure ramps up, you'll need to rely on 'Perks' found in Fossils scattered across the stage to keep the ore supplies rolling in. These boosts can increase the amount of ore you get from defeating an enemy, influence the frequency of treasure chests, or grant bonuses to certain Bananza transformations. There's a boatload of them. What's important, however, is that every Fossil will let you add one to your 'build' — a 'build' that resets with every run. <em>There's</em> the roguelike repetition we know and love!</p>
<p>Whether you fulfil all of Void's quotas or crash out under the pressure, DK's Perks are reset for the next run, so you'll have to start from scratch to craft the ultimate ore-collecting machine. Of course, the genre's randomisation is all present and correct too, so no two builds will be identical — you can only make the most of the Perks presented to you, after all.</p>
<p>It's fast, it's frantic, and it gels beautifully with Bananza's destructive gameplay. I adored how DK handled in the base game, and I got to really put my skills to the test here. The ever-ticking timer means rolls, jumps and Turf Surfs are more important than ever, and there's even a meaty list of rewards that progressively unlock after successful runs that promise new outfits, Perks, and the chance to go rogue(like) on other layers.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158864/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the layer you'll start on (and, let's admit it, the one you'll want to spend the most time with) is DK Island. This is a brand new setting for Bananza, and it looks every bit as enticing as you'd expect. DK's house is here, the DK-shaped mountain is here, even Grant Kirkhope's lovely little island theme from DK 64 is here.</p>
<p>In Emerald Rush, it's a joy to dash past these familiar surroundings en route to your next quota. But without Emerald Rush... it's lifeless. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Odyssey</a>, Bananza feels built for bonus DLC worlds — a new layer with a tiny storyline and a handful of fresh collectibles feels like a no-brainer, right? But, also like Odyssey, Nintendo doesn't seem to see that.</p>
<p>While pretty to look at and fun to run around, DK Island has no unique Banandium Gems or Fossils. There are no missions to complete or bosses to battle. Heck, apart from Squark's Statue hut, there's not even a shop with some new merch. Sure, Emerald Rush brings some of these to the table (one of them crops up <em>right</em> at the end), but without the pressure of the timer ticking away in the background, the new island struck me as a massive wasted opportunity.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158860/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As fun as Emerald Rush is (and, as I've said, it's <em>really</em> fun), its addition alone doesn't quite feel worth the price of admission. If this roguelike island had cropped up in the base game, it'd be happy days all around. Rambi Rumble brought a welcome change of pace to the Racing Layer, so why not do it again? But as it stands, Emerald Rush feels lost in an otherwise quite bland package.</p>
<p>If you've 100%-ed the base game and are looking for an excuse to dive back in for more action, this is a good excuse to do it — you'll get more than a good few hours of roguelike smiles. If you're looking for something more substantial, you won't find it here. I can't believe I'm saying this after tracking down all 777 Banandium Gems, 696 Fossils and 110 Discs in the base game, but this DLC could have done with some more collectibles.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush feels like a split banana. The new roguelike mode is a lot of fun, gelling surprisingly well with the game's core mechanics and giving me a welcome excuse to swing back into my beloved Bananza, but the other half of the deal, DK Island, left me feeling a little short-changed with its lack of appeal outside of the new game mode.</p>
<p>Bananza constantly reminded me of Odyssey as I played through the base game, and now it seems, much like its platforming predecessor, I'm going to be forever thinking about the DLC potential that never was.</p></section>

            <p>
There is nothing inherently awful in a game being obscenely long, in fact it can be quite pleasurable to get to know a digital world so intimately. The issue is that I am an "adult" who has to "work" to pay my "bills" and "taxes," so I don't always have time for such things. How some of you manage to fit in multiple playthroughs of Persona games will always be an enigma to me. But, as I sit here in my despair, along comes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/34everlast">34EVERLAST</a>, a game designed to be beaten in "as little as 10 minutes," expressly designed for "busy working adults."
</p>
<p>
34EVERLAST, according to its Steam page description, is an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> puzzle game about the world ending, which I'm going to be incredibly real with you all for the moment, sounds like a very heavy topic for a game where you can beat it in 10 minutes. However! The way you apparently survive this is by ending the "'worlds that refuse to die' that are parallel to this world." Not any lighter or smaller a concept, potentially compelling though.

<p>
Gameplay works twofold. In the first instance, it's a 3D action game, looking a little bit PlatinumGamesy in nature. You run, fall, and fight through various worlds on the brink of collapse, with what looks like some visual novel stroke manga elements mixed in for the story. There are also some puzzle elements, though how these manifest isn't quite as clear.
</p><p>
As condensed as it is, conceptually I quite like some of the design choices it claims to make. The Steam page says that if you make it rain in one world, a desert in another might turn into a forest. You can die in boss fights on purpose too, to potentially "gain an advantage against another." A smally, flashy package, yet one that, if successful, may have a good bit of substance to it.
</p>
<p>
While I am intrigued by the concept, it does also raise a bigger, perhaps more personally existential question about life. What are the reasons that we have so little time for hobbies we so greatly enjoy? I could probably name a few, but that'd be going into feature territory. I somewhat hope 34EVERLAST takes such a question into consideration in its story, rather than the 10 minute thing just being a bit of a gimmick.
</p>
<p>
There's no exact release date for 34EVERLAST just yet, but it was confirmed by publisher Playism that it's due out sometime in 2026. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2134470/34EVERLAST/">wishlist it on Steam now</a>.

              <p>Have you ever dreamed of playing <em>Halo</em> on an <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839">original Xbox</a>, but you didn’t want to use a big TV? And you also wanted to risk damaging your game disc and/or fingers in the process while holding a large technological monstrosity in your hands? Well, that’s a strange dream you have, buddy, but I got just the video for you.</p> <p>On September 16, as spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/handhelds/now-i-can-take-steel-battalion-with-me-everywhere-hey-gamers-ive-found-your-xbox-handheld/">GamesRadar</a></em>, YouTuber, retro console enthusiast, and modder James Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI">posted a new video</a> to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Games_for_James">wonderful channel</a> all about his wild and wacky experience turning an OG Xbox into a portable handheld console in the most janky way possible. It’s a fantastic video that involves Channel getting shocked, ripping apart multiple electronic devices, and covering the entire beast in a bunch of duct tape. Here’s the video, which is admittedly 33 minutes long, but totally worth watching.</p>  <p>Something I really appreciate about this video is how committed the modder is to making sure this handheld Xbox looks and feels hacked together. It’s like a Frankenstein’s monster of a console, with pieces and parts from an old iPod dock crammed on top of an Xbox’s motherboard. And while it takes him a few attempts and a lot of tinkering, he does eventually pull it off and is able to play <em>Halo</em> in one of the wildest ways possible. It also seems very dangerous, as there is a DVD spinning incredibly fast just a few inches away from his fingers and face at all times.</p> <p>This monster of a thing even sports a relatively impressive 9 minutes and 40 seconds of battery life. That might not sound like a lot, but keep in mind this slapdash device relies on nearly 20-year-old batteries from an iPod dock. The fact that it can even run at all on just those ancient chemical husks is incredible. And if you were then wondering, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/steel-battalion">Can this thing play <em>Steel Battalion</em></a>?” well, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI?t=1964">Yes, it can.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 20 Minutes of Battlefield 6 Operation Firestorm Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>A spokesperson for EA confirmed the finer details about how cross-play works on console, and that is that when it's toggled on, the game will <em>prioritize</em> console-only cross-play, but not guarantee it<em>.</em> Players can select Cross-play Off to only play against people on their platform.</p><p>On PC, cross-play is on by default and cannot be turned off. Here are the two settings and their descriptions, as written by EA: </p><p><strong>Cross-play ON</strong></p><ul><li>On console, when cross-play is on, we will prioritize allocating you on servers with other console-only players, but players can expect to be in a larger matchmaking pool with players on all platforms. Cross-play On is the only option available on PC.</li></ul><p><strong>Cross-play OFF</strong></p><ul><li>You will only play against players on your platform (Xbox only if on Xbox, PlayStation only if on PlayStation). Joining with friends/parties containing players from other platforms will not be available.</li></ul><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">battle royale mode</a> is in development as well, and it <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1968006588784058548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">could launch on October 28. </a></p>

                <p>Florida has set its lasers to "sue" as the Sunshine State moves to attack porn games and their distributors in court.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/09/15/florida-targets-porn-video-game-websites-under-child-safety-law/86167331007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Tallahassee Democrat</a>, Florida's attorney general James Uthmeier filed two separate lawsuits against Lustyheroes.com and the parent company of Nutaku.net and SpiceVids.com. The dual suits allege that these websites have violated <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HB 3</a>, the state law that went into effect in January and forced explicit websites to verify the ages of Florida users.</p><p>According to Uthmeier, all three websites have skirted the responsibility of ensuring that people visiting them are at least 18 years old. As such, he's serving them fresh lawsuits to ostensibly make examples out of them.</p><p>"Florida is committed to being the best place to raise children," Uthmeier said in <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-james-uthmeier-files-complaints-against-pornography-websites-violating" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a press release</a>. "We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it. We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards."</p><p>Gethins Limited is the distributor of Lustyheroes, while Aylo is the parent company behind Nutaku and SpiceVids (as well as Pornhub). Although Gethins Limited has yet to publicly comment on the lawsuit, Aylo said both Nutaku and SpiceVids have complied with the legislation since it went into effect earlier this year.</p><p>"We intend to vigorously defend against these allegations in court," Aylo told the Tallahassee Democrat. "These platforms are committed to ongoing compliance with applicable state laws. We look forward to presenting the facts through the appropriate legal process."</p><p>This is the latest development in the ongoing battle against pornographic material by Republican lawmakers. If you're an explicit-material enjoyer--whether casual or otherwise--you may have seen age verification pop-ups when visiting these websites (depending on where you live in the US). GOP members are adamant that, to protect the kids, "graphic" and "harmful" material must be abated. But there are always ways to consume porn.</p>
