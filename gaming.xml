            <p>As the first Something Of Mana game to come out in 15 years, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions Of Mana</a> is bound to be exciting some of you out there. Well, funnel all that anticipation into your mouse-clicking finger, because developers Square Enix have just put up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">a playable demo of the bright JRPG</a> on Steam. I'm not sure how much the demo offers, as we're only told it includes "a section of the story, battles and exploration." But that's better than nothing, and with a full month before release, you have plenty of time to scope it out.</p>

<p>Playing the demo will also get you some flashy weapons when it comes time to play the full game, say Square Enix in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2490990/view/4360131627020109908">an accompanying post</a>. The Gladius, Falx, and Horn Lance will unlock at certain points in its full release, provided you have the data from the demo on your PC. However, actual progress from the demo won't carry over to the full game, we're told. This is the one thing that stops me playing demos - the gnawing fear that I will have to repeat something I have already done. An absolutely bone-shattering debilitation to have when one is a games journalist. Never mind.</p>
<p>In Visions Of Mana you play as Val, a young lad from the local "Fire Village", as he travels to the Tree of Mana with his Val pals, exploring "semi-open" environments and donking enemy monsters in party-based real-time combat. So far it looks very colourful and cheery, if a little conventional. It's still one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">75 most anticipated games of the year</a>. Our Jeremy has fond Mana-ly memories, for example, and is interested to see what Squeenix do with the first original game in the series since 2007 (we're not counting all the remakes). He's excited that Flammie, the Falcor-inspired mascot of the series, seems to be a party member in this entry. You can see the fluffy little dragon guy fighting alongside our heroes in the trailers.</p>
<p>The full game is due out August 29th. We may have more thoughts on it then. You should always check back when we have more thoughts. You have no idea how many thoughts we all have here. Listen, just keep us open in a tab for the rest of the month and hit refresh every day. The thoughts never cease. </p>

            <p>In Cleanfall you essentially play a Roomba that is trying to reverse the apocalypse because the apocalypse is <em>messy</em>. A Roomba capable of tunnelling through miles of procedurally generated, monster-infested crust so as to reorganise the Earth's core and bring about its ultimate objective - a sparkling living room. I enjoy the militant reductiveness of this character motivation. There are sprawling underground ecosystems to discover, yes, weird plants to harvest, fractious clumps of tentacles to appraise, avoid or slaughter. But all of these things are contemptible details to be swept up and bagged and thrown in the dumpster.</p><!--more-->

<p>"You are a small, unassuming cleaning bot that desires nothing more than a neat and tidy home," reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2769780/CleanFall/">the Steam page</a>. "But ever since the planet was dragged closer to the sun by a monomaniacal tech nerd, dust and death swirl across the surface, making for a very messy situation. If your house will ever be clean again, you need to fix the world. A clean world means a clean house. So, fix the world. Simple." Pretty sure this is how Genghis Khan got started.</p>
<p>Cleanfall takes the form of a 2D platformer roguelite with a surprising tower defence element. As the aforesaid cleaning bot, which you can upgrade into an extremely jaded robo-maid, you'll burrow through each biome in search of resources, items and hidden friendly or at least, non-hostile characters. You'll study the habits of organisms which look like spiders, tadpoles and octopods dosed up on Compound V. And you'll build hellish dangling labyrinths of "alchemic" turrets, ranging from mortars to drone hubs. Going by the trailer above, the action nears bullet hell intensity when there's a full complement of rancid kaiju spermatozoa involved.</p>
<p>I haven't had a chance to play, but there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3130820/CleanFall_Demo/">a demo on Steam</a>, and initial user reactions suggest that this is worth a pop. The full game is out in 2025. The obvious comparisons, which I will now crudely weld into a revolting headline, are Spelunky and Terraria with a touch of Carrion and Noita. </p>

            <p>After years of anticipation mixed with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">a few unexpected delays</a>, Team Folon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-fan-made-mod-out-today">Fallout: London mod finally released last week</a>.</p>
<p>The fan-made game-sized mod for Fallout 4 faced a number of challenges on launch, however. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-ian-explore-the-new-fan-made-fallout-london-mod-in-todays-live-stream">our Ian discovered when he gave it a whirl last week</a>, he couldn't explore very much of it because it kept hard crashing back to his desktop (he did get mauled to death by a fox, though, so still rates the whole experience very highly).</p>
<p>You can see Ian playing through some Fallout: London via the video below.</p>

<p>Thankfully for those like Ian who are eager to explore more of the mod - which despite its issues clearly holds a lot of promise - Team Folon is working on a fix.</p>
<p>Addressing the "reported technical issues" in Fallout: London in a post on social media platform X, the team said it will release an update "soon". It then thanked everyone for their patience in the meantime.</p>
<p>Team Folon also shared an installation guide which it said should help make the process "as hassle-free as it gets". <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/fallout_london/fallout_london_quick_start_guide_common_bug_fixes/page1">You can find it here</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Eurogamer has followed the development of Team Folon's mod for some time. Recently, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-cast-will-include-former-speaker-of-the-house-john-bercow">former Speaker of the House John Bercow would be lending his voice</a> to an AI robot. In addition to Bercow, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-adds-baldurs-gate-3-actor-to-its-cast">Neil Newbon - voice of Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3 - is also in the cast</a>.</p>
<p>As for Fallout more generally, it has had quite the renaissance this year, thanks to the popularity of Amazon's TV series. This Fallout adaptation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">watched by 65 million people in its first two weeks</a> and has just recently been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominated for 16 Emmy Awards</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">second season was announced to be in the pipeline</a> soon after the show made its debut in April. According to showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible"</a>. Well, Ghoul blimey!</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> staff are concerned a third round of layoffs could hit the streaming platform, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reportedly-set-to-lay-off-around-500-employees-later-this-week">500 job cuts earlier this year</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-lays-off-400-employees-as-part-of-latest-amazon-cuts">400 in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87">The Wall Street Journal</a>, which states Amazon paid almost $1bn for Twitch but it's now making less money and engagement has slowed.
</p>
<p>
The company is set to have an annual operational review this autumn and staff are concerned more job losses could follow. Amazon chief executive Andy Jassy has led a profitability review at Twitch and shown little tolerance for unprofitable business, the Journal reports.

<p>

Sources at Twitch are concerned the platform could become a "zombie brand" at Amazon. These are projects or acquisitions that are sidelined for not living up to expectations - Goodreads and Woot are two examples.
</p>
<p>
A spokeswoman for Amazon told the Journal it has always taken a long-term view of Twitch and noted its ability to attract harder-to-reach audiences. The company said it remains confident in Twitch's potential.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-isnt-profitable-admits-ceo-in-wake-of-recent-layoffs">Twitch CEO Dan Clancy admitted the company isn't profitable</a>, shortly after layoffs were announced.

</p>
<p>
Amazon doesn't publicly reveal revenue figures for Twitch, but internal documents reviewed by the Journal suggest it generated about $667m in ad revenue and $1.3bn in commerce revenue in 2023. This accounts for less than 0.5 percent of Amazon's total revenue for the year.
</p>
<p>
The Journal reports spending on subscriptions is down and, if internal projections are correct, Twitch could shed almost a quarter of a billion dollars in revenue by the end of 2025. Further, Twitch's advertising sales have plateaued since its boom during the pandemic.
</p>
<p>
According to network analytics and security firm Noka Deepfield, Twitch has dropped from the fourth largest source of US web traffic in 2014 when bought by Amazon to the 18th.
</p>
<p>
"We definitely are intending to be around for many years," VP of product Jeremy Forrester told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-twitch-safety-growth-and-the-importance-of-finding-community">Eurogamer at this year's TwitchCon EU event</a>. "Obviously the biggest action that we took was the layoffs... to try and put Twitch in a position to be sustainable for the long run. We want to be in a position where we can continue supporting creators for the longest time."

</p>
<p>
"I personally feel very confident about where we are right now," he continued. "We're structured in a way in which we have a good line of sight for the next few years of where we want to go and where we want to be."
</p>
<p>
A major part of Twitch's strategy is improving its mobile experience. At TwitchCon EU it announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">new mobile app would be released this summer</a> - that's now available for all users.

</p>
<p>
"Today, most of the hours watched on Twitch come from our desktop experience. But in any given month, over 50 percent of users primarily use Twitch on their phone, with 40 percent exclusively using their phone," reveals a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/07/29/find-content-you-love-faster-with-the-new-twitch-mobile-app/">blog post about the new app</a>. "Most of our desktop users also check in regularly from the app. This is even more pronounced with new viewers - almost three quarters start watching Twitch for the first time on mobile."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-could-definitely-offer-up-to-4x-ray-tracing-performance-of-base-model-but-path-tracing-will-remain-ambitious-leaked-specs-suggest.940143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-4x-performance-ray-tracing-path-tracing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro could definitely offer&nbsp;<span>up to four times the ray tracing performance of the base model claimed in&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked documents</a>, as some of the system's new ray tracing features </span>will indeed bring considerable performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3MlpJrJHXE">latest episode of their weekly podcas</a>t, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a look at some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/">leaked new ray tracing features that will be included in the RDNA 4 architecture</a> and will make their way onto the upcoming console, highlighting how some of them, such as double ray tracing intersect engine and BVH footprint improvement could indeed lead to much better performance. The former, for example, will improve the performance of the intersect engine that is used to repurpose texture units as ray tracing accelerators to do the smaller part of ray tracing, which is also the most expensive. The latter, on the other hand, should improve BHV compaction, which is used to reduce the memory footprint for what a developer needs to trace against. As of now, on PC, NVIDIA benefits more from BHV compaction, but this enhancement should improve things on AMD as well as on the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this recent leak doesn't go into any detail regarding specific hardware changes and does not make any mention of traversal, which is an important part of ray tracing. NVIDIA and Intel, for example, have hardware that takes over the traversal aspect of shooting a ray through the BVH structure, which is something extremely expensive and that is notoriously bad on a "normal" GPU. A patent from Sony a while back revealed a traversal unit that has yet to surface in any PlayStation 5 Pro leak, so maybe the console will have new hardware that will further improve ray tracing quality.</p>
<p>However, if the system really lacks traversal acceleration, then path tracing may be too ambitious for it. Older games with path tracing, like Quake 2 RTX or even Minecraft, could definitely run on the system, but more modern titles, like games powered by Unreal Engine 5, never could, no matter how simple they are. Since games will still need to run on the base model, the scale of ambition of the PlayStation 5 Pro is certainly limited.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #173: PS5 Pro RT Features, PS5 Pro No Man's Sky Settings, Fallout London Launches!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3MlpJrJHXE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed. If the system is indeed releasing before the end of the year, it will undoubtedly be finally announced within the next few weeks.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has today released a demo for its forthcoming Action-RPG Visions of Mana.
</p>
<p>
Included in the demo are story, battle, and exploration elements, plus players who complete it will receive three weapons for main character Val in the full game. It takes place partway through the first chapter, but progress won't carry over to the main game as the demo has been specially created.
</p>
<p>
The demo was surprise-released, with a new trailer below showing off some new gameplay.

The demo is available across all platforms: <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0082-PPSA19985_00-VOMPS5EUDEMO0001">PS5</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0082-CUSA46336_00-VOMPS4EUDEMO0001">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/visions-of-mana-demo/9nkcvgj43sts">Xbox Series X/S</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2490990/Visions_of_Mana/">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
Visions of Mana will be the first new game in the series for over 15 years - it began with Secret of Mana on the SNES back in 1993 and has seen multiple releases since.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, fresh details on its Elemental Vessels were revealed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/29/visions-of-mana-new-details-on-three-elemental-vessels-plus-deep-dive-video/">PlayStation Blog</a>.
</p>
<p>
The series has long revolved around elemental powers and Visions of Mana is no different. Here, acquiring Elemental Vessels has three effects: they provide methods of environmental traversal, and they impact combat by providing both elemental abilities and altering the class of the character they're assigned to.
</p>
<p>
"One of the most important elements of Mana games is that feeling that you're interacting with the elementals (spirits that control elements like wind, fire or darkness)," said director Ryosuke Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
"That's at the core of the design of Visions of Mana and something that was really important to me. It's such a vital part of that distinctive Mana series identity, and if the battles didn't capture it, there would be no point to the game at all!"
</p>
<p>
Said series producer Masaru Oyamada: "The Mana series has always featured eight distinct elementals with each embodying one of the core forces that shape the world. Naturally then, there would be eight vessels that house each of their powers. We came up with lots of interesting ideas for different objects to use, but ultimately aimed to create designs that would best capture the interesting aspects of each elemental."
</p>
<p>
New examples of the Elemental Vessels were provided in the blog. For instance, the Lumina Lantern houses the power of light which can use the power of reflection to create new walkways and reflect damage between enemies. Shade Sight, meanwhile, has the power of darkness and gravity, acting like a grappling hook.
</p>
<p>
More details on these Elemental Vessels are in the below video.

<p>
Yoshida also discussed how the elements are integrated into combat.
</p>
<p>
"Central mechanics like switching between three party members in battle, using ring menu and shortcut bindings are inspired by elements from past Mana games. However, I had a strong desire to put more weight on switching between different characters during combat," said Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
"One way we did this, for example, was through the Elemental Vessels and the gameplay options they offer. You have a party of three characters and can equip each one with a different Elemental Vessel that manifests different effects. It's possible to follow up after you use one of these effects by switching and using a different elemental power to create an even more potent compound ability. 
</p>
<p>
"In this way we create motivation and benefits for the player to switch between different characters in battle."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-releases-this-august-square-enix-announces">Visions of Mana is set for release</a> on 29th August. I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-returns-to-series-roots-but-is-yet-to-flower-into-a-truly-original-experience">hands-on with it earlier this year</a> and was impressed with its return to series roots.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/summer-games-the-lost-olympics<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Forgotten Gems is a regular column about notable games that have moved out of the public eye and may not be easily accessible anymore. To see all the other games I've covered so far, be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns/forgotten-gems"><em>13 previous issues of Forgotten Gems</em></a><em> in our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/columns"><em>Columns</em></a><em> section.</em></p><p>First-person shooters. Roleplaying games. Action adventures. Even though they’ve evolved significantly alongside the gaming hardware they run on, some of today’s most-popular genres are multiple decades old and are likely here to stay for good. It’s hard to imagine people not playing a Call of Duty game in 2030, just as it’s unlikely that fighting games like Street Fighter and Tekken will just be over and done with in the foreseeable future. </p><p>But some some genres have definitely diminished over the years to the point of almost disappearing entirely. Real-time strategy games – like StarCraft – at one time filled entire sports arenas of people eager to watch esports competitions. I haven’t heard anyone mention the “brain training” genre in years. Some bygone genres come complete with physical relics – literal skeletons in our closets: plastic guitars, fake drumkits, or even turntable controllers  One of you – yes, I’m talking to you – even still has that Tony Hawk skateboarding controller in his attic.</p><h2>We Have The Olympics at Home</h2><p>As a kid, I couldn’t have imagined that The Games would ever end. When we didn’t know what else to do, a “quick game” of Epyx’s Summer Games or Winter Games would inevitably fill an entire afternoon. As you may be able to guess just from their titles, Epyx’s sports games simulated events you would find at the Olympic Games or in Track &amp; Field competitions, with different control styles depending on the style of each event.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/29/summergames-ad-1984-1722297026057.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>While not licensed by the IOC, Epyx played to 1984's Olympic Fever in all its marketing.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite being one of the defining multiplayer game series of the ‘80s, these Commodore 64 (et al.) hits kept us busy until 1992 and then quickly vanished, essentially ending what we thought would be a game genre for the ages. </p><p>There’s not even a widely-accepted game sub-genre moniker to attach to them. “Multi-event sports” games, perhaps? But they were all the rage in the early ‘80s thanks to the genre-defining Olympic Decathlon created by Timothy W. Smith for the TRS-80, Tandy’s home computer system sold via their Radio Shack stores (TRS stands for Tandy Radio Shack). This ten-event “key-masher” really took off when it was ported to Apple II in 1982. It then got an even wider release year later on IBM PC under the name Microsoft Decathlon.</p><p>Summer Games, like Konami’s 1983 arcade hit Track &amp; Field (aka Hyper Olympic), took inspiration from Decathlon, but left behind the top-down track views of the original to try and create more realistic, TV-like visuals. The two games were developed in parallel, with Konami’s game out of Japan becoming a major success in arcades and Summer Games targeting home computers instead. The race was on – and a new gaming genre was born. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Decathlon was our first choice, because it seemed like it would be easy to break up into discrete tasks that each programmer could work on without needing to interact." - Scott Nelson</p></div><p>“I just remember the Apple II Decathlon game was being successful, or at least a lot of us were having fun with it at work,” said Jon Leupp, who came over from Starpath and ended up designing and programming a number of memorable events in Epyx’s Games. “The events were all so simple, and the fun was trying to beat each other’s scores and of course to always trying to improve your own best score just a tiny bit more. We realized we could take the graphics to a whole new level so it seemed like a great project to move forward with.”</p><h2>Getting Summer Games on Track</h2><p>In a now-archived <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020312054517fw_/https://home.arcor.de/cybergoth/epyx/summer1interview1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Epyx Shrine interview</a>, designer Scott Nelson, responsible for the framework and master control program, said that the choice to work on Summer Games was a pragmatic one: “When Starpath and Epyx merged, we needed a C64 game quickly. That meant a project that five or six people could work on at the same time, and still actually reduce the time to market. Decathlon was our first choice, because it seemed like it would be easy to break up into discrete tasks that each programmer could work on without needing to interact.”</p><p>But the team didn’t like some of the events included in decathlon and started from scratch to create a new list of events they wanted to include. “We had a big list of possible events, and picked the ones we thought would be easiest to do,” said Nelson. “Some of the events that looked hard ended up in Summer Games II."</p><p>The designers locked in six unique events and two variants – Pole Vault, Platform Diving, 4x400m Relay, 100m Dash, Gymnastics, Freestyle Relay Swimming, 100m Freestyle Swimming, and Skeet Shooting – and delivered the final game for release in 1984. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Summer Games (1984, Epyx) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While most of the events used a 2D side view, Skeet Shooting, developed by Leupp, took a different angle as the sole first-person perspective event.</p><p>“We were trying hard in those original games to keep details like the scoring systems fairly accurate to the real world events. We also wanted to capture something of the feel of the mechanics, though clearly with a joystick and a button that’s a bit of a stretch,” he told me. “For Skeet Shooting I wanted the gravity of the gun barrel to come into play and force you to account for that as you swung through to lead the target. I studied the real world event rather than looking at any similar game mechanics, so that may explain my ‘unique’ approach.”</p><p>This courage to depart from the visual and gameplay templates of other events in the same package and include unique physics quirks to create wholly new experiences would become a defining trait for the Epyx Games series for years to come.</p><h2>Sprint to the Finish</h2><p>While lightning fast by today’s standards, the actual development process turned out far more interactive than Nelson originally envisioned, according to Leupp. “We were all in the same office. I believe we all designed our events ourselves but we discussed the initial designs as a group so we had buy-in from everyone,” he recalls. “We were a good collaborative group so we’d ask for and offer each other advice throughout development. There were no egos getting in the way. We all played each other’s games as they came together, more for fun than as an official process, but of course that helped make all the games better.”</p><p>Obviously, hitting a summer release window was crucial timing for a game called Summer Games – but more importantly, it arrived in time for the much-hyped 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Whether it was the perfect timing or the design team’s wise decision to avoid the joystick-breaking, button-mashing approach of its contemporaries, Summer Games was a hit! </p><p>It seemed like the design team at Epyx had come up with a perfect formula for success. Critics and gamers liked the varied, and more technical approach to sports events – and this type of game could be developed fast while still maintaining a high quality level if the individual designers all delivered on their respective parts of the whole.</p><p>“One fun thing is that different designers bring different approaches to events, so I think that brought a fun variety of experiences to the package that might not have been true if a single designer had made them all,” said Leupp. “Another nice thing about multi-event games is it’s easy to create more events, so when Summer Games turned out to be a huge hit, it only made sense to do Summer Games II, Winter Games, California Games, and others.”</p><h2>Faster, Higher, Stronger, Gone</h2><p>Long before Activision and EA  talking about “annualized franchises”, Epyx started releasing a new “Games” title every year. Winter Games hit just months after Summer Games in 1984. Summer Games II followed in 1984. World Games in 1985. California Games in 1987. In 1988, the year of the Summer Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea, and the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, Epyx released two games under the new brand names The Games: Summer Edition and Winter Edition. But despite securing an official licensing deal from the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team, The Games weren’t able to recapture the excitement of the earlier titles. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Epyx Games: Complete Playlist</h3><p>From Summer Games to Winter and back to the sun of California, here are all of Epyx's sports games over the years.</p></div><p>The inevitable California Games II arrived almost as a footnote in 1990 for DOS PCs and was ported to other platforms, including the SNES, two years later. By then, Epyx had downsized significantly, laid off all but 20 employees – a tenth of its workforce just four years earlier – and shifted to exclusively work on Atari Lynx games. Whether it was oversaturation, or the company’s choice to back ailing Atari instead of aligning with new market leader Nintendo, Epyx kept shrinking until its remaining assets were sold off to Bridgestone Multimedia and the company ceased to exist. </p><p>“Epyx went bankrupt because it never really understood why it had been successful in the past, and then decided to branch out in a lot of directions, all of which turned out to be failures", programmer Stephen Landrum said in an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090504083458/https://www.fomalhaut.de/c64.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived interview</a> on a German fan site. </p><p>While Epyx’s sports games are not a household name today, you’d be hard pressed to find gamers in their 50s who grew up playing games on C64 or Atari computers and couldn’t immediately tell you their favorite. For me, personally, it never got better than the original Winter Games. Gorgeous art aside, there was just something special about how well that game rewarded players for learning the intricacies of its very technical controls. The Biathlon mode is almost a mini-adventure game of its own; the way it cycles through multiple screens before getting to the gun range! I have fond memories of playing arcade game competitor Track &amp; Field as well (I used improvised contraptions such as a pen and pen-cap "seesaw" for maximum buttonmashery, just so I could rank higher than our local arcade machine’s top-ranked players... Curse you, “ASS” and “SEX”!) -- but in the end, Summer and Winter Games will always remain my favorite sports games from those days.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/wintergames-1722298240315.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Instead of rote button mashing or joystick waggling, Winter Games' Biathlon event requires players to balance  their skiier's movement and watch their pulse to ensure a steady hand during the shooting portion.</figcaption></figure></output><p>However, most of my friends will point to California Games as the one that stuck with them. Not only did California Games tackle surfing way before it became an Olympic discipline, programmer Jon Leupp blazed trails to create the first – and many would argue still best – surfing video (mini) game of all time. </p><p>“For better or worse in my career, I never stopped to consider how difficult a task might be. If it was fun, I wanted to do it. So, the first challenge was to make an animated wave. Clearly that wasn’t going to be done with sprites, so I wrote a character set animation tool and Susie Greene did a great job building a rolling wave with it”, recalls Leupp. “I studied wave physics and initially tried simulating those, then quickly punted and just used tables that I tweaked to make the motions feel reasonable. In the Lynx version the designer went wild and allowed quadruple flips and those sorts of things which actually made it super fun. I think that was the right thing to do for that new handheld device, and that new generation of games. In the original I was still trying to simulate real world competitive surfing. “</p><h2>Where Can You Play it Now?</h2><p>Just like MOBAs taking over from competitive RTS games or Rocket League becoming this generation's NBA Jam, there is, of course, an heir to the decathlon-likes. All it took was for control methods to evolve – namely, via Nintendo’s Wii Remote and Nunchuk – and suddenly every game publisher under both the summer and winter sun released multi-event sports competitions once again. Only, this time, players used gestures and Wii’s version of button mashing, the dreaded “waggle”. Even Mario &amp; Sonic got in on it and headlined a series of officially-licensed, whimsical takes on the Olympic Games that lasted until the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.</p><p>Wii Sports started the fad and became one of the most-played video games of all time, but like Epyx’s Games, the new-found trend didn’t last. Too many people waggled far too much in too little time and what looked like a new way to play quickly became an old way to never play again.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The genre feels timeless to me so I’d be surprised to not see new incarnations of it in the future." - Jon Leupp</p></div><p>“The genre feels timeless to me so I’d be surprised to not see new incarnations of it in the future,” agrees Leupp, who left the games industry to work on slot machines for the last 27 years and just retired from that job in February to spend more time traveling with his wife and his two Australian Shepherd dogs. “Maybe online leaderboards have replaced the charm of trying to outdo your friends scores on a single simple event, or a series of events, but I can still imagine creating games where those components are appealing.”</p><p>You can, of course, gather friends and family for a great time playing modern, more raucous takes on multi-event games like Nintendo’s own Mario Party. But if you want to revisit the dinosaurs that didn’t quite make it, you can pick up a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/30/the-c64-mini-review">Commodore 64 Mini micro-console</a> and play California Games, Summer Games II, World Games, and Winter Games with period-appropriate joysticks. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/c64mini-1722299437857.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The most authentic way to relieve the glory of (at least some of) the Epyx Games is via The C64 Mini. Check <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/30/the-c64-mini-review">our review</a> for more.</figcaption></figure></output><p>If you don't want any additional hardware in your home, Pixel Games UK licensed the rights for some of Epyx's games and put out a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/summer-games-atari-2600cpcmaster-systemspectrum">2022 Summer Games compilation</a> on Steam -- but there's a catch: it collects only the inferior ports (from Atari 2600 to ZX Spectrum), not the classic C64 edition or the decent Atari 8-bit conversion. The famed Atari Lynx version of California Games saw a re-release this year via <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-epyx-collection-handheld">The Epyx Collection: Handheld</a> on Nintendo Switch, courtesy of the same publisher. The lack of an IOC license is actually an advantage for game preservation as it’s much easier for the games to get reissued without changes, so we're bound to also see the C64 originals in more places in the future. </p><p>The idea behind Summer Games lives on. I’m hopeful that someday, someone will pick up the torch and assemble an ensemble of talented game designers to create the most realistic take on the world’s most enduring athletic competition. Until then, you may just have to travel back to 1984 to relieve the genre’s glory days. Or watch the real Olympics on TV.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/PeerIGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Peer Schneider</em></a><em> leads game guides and tools strategy across IGN, Map Genie, RockPaperShotGun, VG247, and Eurogamer.

In Behaviour Interactive's post-apocalyptic multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/meet-your-maker">Meet Your Maker</a>, you raise grim forts of rusty blocks, pop-out manglers and robot ambushers from the desert sands. Each base harbours a cannister of genetic material and other resources, and the idea is to fiendishly arrange traps and defences to stop people taking your precious genmat while doing your best to clean out their bases. Sound like good wholesome fun? You might want to check out the current free trial on Steam. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear from the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1194810/eventcomments/4514380244078925809?snr=1_2108_9__2107">announcement release</a> how long the trial will last. It's also not entirely clear how long Meet Your Maker will last. The shoot-o-builder launched to a largely positive reception, but has seemingly struggled to build a following. <a href="https://meetyourmakergame.com/news/whats-next-for-meet-your-maker/">As of March this year</a>, Behaviour have "[shifted] the team's attention towards new and exciting projects within the company" following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">layoffs in January</a>. Since then the game has received more superficial-sounding updates in the form of seasonal Expedition level-up tracks for cosmetics items. Behaviour <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">made another, much larger round of layoffs in June</a>.
</p>
<p>
All that notwithstanding, Meet Your Maker can be a hoot and a holler. The advantage of theming the whole thing around raiding bases, of course, is that the game is better equipped to weather the shrinking of the active player base. I tried it back at launch last year, and while I didn't manage to fulfil my overall objective of recreating the Central Perk cafe from Friends  with a cast of bellowing cyborgs, I did enjoy getting slaughtered by other people's cheeky contraptions. Lava cube above the floor spikes, is it? You scalliwags!</p>
<p>"Curious is the trapmaker's art - his efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes," ponders the Ancestor from Darkest Dungeon. Not in this case, Mr Ancestor - Meet Your Maker comes with a Replay Station that lets you watch other people raiding your maps. Smash a few of those together with the Benny Hill music and you're surely in the running for a BAFTA. As for those "new and exciting" projects at Behaviour - I wouldn't be surprised if a few had been shelved during the company's last round of cost-cutting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> remains Behaviour's flagship production, bolstered by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lara-croft-is-the-next-survivor-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">a steady stream of guest stars from other games</a>.

			<p>Developer Keen Games announced the release of a new major update for the survival action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/enshrouded-2024-early-access-roadmap-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enshrouded</a>. 'Back to the Shroud' adds support for AMD FSR 3, upgraded from FSR 2, although it should be clarified there is no frame generation (yet). They just updated FidelityFX Super Resolution to the latest version, thus improving its quality.</p>
<p>From a gameplay standpoint, the update's highlight is the addition of several difficulty modifiers that allow you to customize your Enshrouded experience. The developers have set four standard settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Default</strong>: this difficulty is still present as the baseline and would be the recommended setting for first-time players.</li>
<li><strong>Relaxed</strong>: reduces the amount of enemies and provides you with more resources and loot. A perfect mode if you are most interested in base-building and light-hearted adventuring.</li>
<li><strong>Hard</strong>: increases the amount of enemies and makes them more aggressive to give you a tougher combat experience.</li>
<li><strong>Survival</strong>: for those who seek some punishment with additional survival mechanics on top of more aggressive enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, over thirty individual settings can be tweaked to the player's preferences, from enemy damage to boss health, player skills, and even a starvation mode similar to other survival games, to the duration of buffs, the length of day and night cycles, and the duration of the Shroud. All these tweaks are available both in single player and co-op mode, including when playing on dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Keen Games also introduced new character customization options with this update for skin color, eye color, eyebrow color, and six additional character presets. Moreover, equipment like armor pieces and weapons can now be displayed in your base by attaching them to newly available craftable props; collectible props can also be found throughout the world of Enshrouded and then displayed on decorative shelves. Last but not least, the crafting menu was improved, the block and parry system was refined, and several points of interest have been expanded.</p>

<p>Enshrouded has sold nearly three million units to date. The full version is still planned to launch at some point next year on PC and consoles.</p>

<p>The World Series of Warzone Global Final has just been given a location by Activision Blizzard, and this year, it’s headed to Las Vegas, Nevada. Last year, the tournament took place in the United Kingdom, but Call of Duty is slipping away from Europe dramatically quickly. This time around, players will travel to the Orleans Arena in LAs Vegas to compete for a portion of the $1 million prize pool.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard has left the organisation of the World Series of Warzone very late this season. On September 14, the best Warzone players in the business will travel to Las Vegas to take part in this million-dollar event, but with just six weeks of notice until the tournament takes place, many are grumbling about the close schedule.</p>



<p>Activision recently revealed the teams (trios) competing at the World Series of Warzone Global Final:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a stunning list of players, and there’s a $300,000 prize reserved for the number one squad. Last year, that squad was Team Biffle, with Biffle, Shifty, and Sage winning the top prize in an epic fashion. </p>



<p>Las Vegas’ World Series of Warzone event will also herald the return of SoloYolo, a winner-takes-all tournament with a one-shot match and a $50,000 grand prize for <strong>one player</strong>. This has historically been one of the most exciting tournaments in the Call of Duty: Warzone space, and it’s all over in a matter of minutes. </p>



<p>This is a fairly huge deal for Call of Duty fans – Activision has invested more in the World Series of Warzone this year than in previous years. It’s easily one of the most popular events in the battle royale space, pulling in hundreds of thousands of viewers. </p>



<p>It all kicks off on September 14 – will you be watching?</p>

<p>Call of Duty is one of the most electrifying FPS franchises ever made. It has a history that stretches back more than twenty years, and for the last decade, it has been coming up as one of the most popular esports games in the business. In this guide, we’re breaking down everything you need to know about Call of Duty esports, from the best tournaments to the most notable players who have spearheaded the growth of the competitive scene.</p>



<p>If you want to know as much as possible about COD esports, look no further than this guide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-an-esports-game">Is Call of Duty an Esports Game?</h2>



<p>Typically, any game that boasts a competitive, multiplayer-based platform can be an esports game – that’s all that’s technically needed. However, Call of Duty transcends that, with the series being the home of a multi-million-dollar esports ecosystem backed up by Activision Blizzard and some of the best esports organisations in the world.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has been growing as an esports game for more than ten years, with the first big-budget, mainstream Call of Duty tournaments surfacing in 2012 with Black Ops II. That was when the first Call of Duty World Championship tournament took place, but thanks to MLG and similar organisations, the origins of COD esports still go back a little further.</p>



<p>It might not be as big as Counter-Strike or as valuable as Dota 2, but Call of Duty esports are still popular enough to pull in hundreds of thousands of viewers with each new tournament. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-tournaments">Best Call of Duty Tournaments</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of Duty esports scene would be nothing without the tournaments that make it so popular. Every year, the best Call of Duty teams fight for millions of dollars and immense bragging rights, taking to grand stages around the world to face off against their opponents.</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of the best Call of Duty esports tournaments:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Call of Duty League</strong>: The top-tier competitive league in COD esports which takes place annually</li>



<li><strong>Call of Duty Challengers:</strong> The second-level tier of competitive Call of Duty that is played alongside the CDL</li>



<li><strong>World Series of Warzone</strong>: Call of Duty Warzone’s foremost tournament, which is played on a global level</li>



<li><strong>Esports World Cup: </strong>Call of Duty appears at the Esports World Cup with a multiplayer and a battle royale category</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-valuable-call-of-duty-tournament">What is the most valuable Call of Duty tournament?</h3>



<p>The most valuable Call of Duty tournament is the Call of Duty League, which is the highest tier of competitive COD. It has a prize pool that exceeds $5 million per year.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-the-most-popular-call-of-duty-tournament">What is the most popular Call of Duty tournament?</h3>



<p>The Call of Duty League remains the most popular COD tournament in 2024, boasting peak viewership counts that almost reach half a million users per event.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-pro-players">Best Call of Duty Pro Players</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of the best Call of Duty esports players, but for now, here’s a small assortment of the top COD players in history:</p>



<h3 id="h-damon-karma-barlow">Damon ‘Karma’ Barlow</h3>



<p>In 2024, Karma became the first COD player with four ‘rings’ after winning the Call of Duty League Championship as OpTic Texas’ coach. He has secured three world championships as a player and won the first-ever title in BO2 in 2012 with Fariko Impact.</p>



<h3 id="h-ian-crimsix-porter">Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter</h3>



<p>Crimsix is the winningest COD player ever, boasting more ‘chips’ and rings than any other player. He is retired from Call of Duty now, but his legacy lives on and he’s regarded as a Hall of Fame player by many.</p>



<h3 id="h-seth-scump-abner">Seth ‘Scump’ Abner</h3>



<p>Scump was known as the King of Call of Duty before his retirement in 2023. He has been the face of COD esports for years and is one of the most popular creators and gamers in the COD space.</p>



<h3 id="h-chris-simp-lehr">Chris ‘Simp’ Lehr</h3>



<p>Simp is considered a prodigy in Call of Duty esports, being one of the most consistent players ever seen by fans. He has represented Atlanta FaZe for years and has become one of the wealthiest players thanks to his many wins and close finishes.</p>



<h3 id="h-matthew-formal-piper">Matthew ‘FormaL’ Piper</h3>



<p>FormaL now plays competitive Halo, but in his Call of Duty days, he was a force to be reckoned with. Many consider FormaL to be the greatest controller-based esports player ever, and he’s one of just two people in the world with an esports world championship win in two different games.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-call-of-duty-esports">How to Watch Call of Duty Esports</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard often changes where the Call of Duty League is broadcast – some years it’s Twitch, others it’s on YouTube. That’s the sum total of the debate, though – it’s one of those platforms. </p>



<p>Every year, the most popular COD streamers will also sign up to ‘co-stream’ any gameplay in the Call of Duty space, so you’re spoilt for choice when it comes to figuring out how to watch Call of Duty online.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-call-of-duty-teams">Best Call of Duty Teams</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The roster of Call of Duty teams is chopping and changing all the time, but these days, the core organisations tend to remain the same. The players that represent these organisations will regularly change, but their make-up mostly remains static.</p>



<p>Here are some of the best Call of Duty teams in the esports scene right now:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>OpTic Texas</strong></li>



<li><strong>Atlanta FaZe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Toronto Ultra</strong></li>



<li><strong>New York Subliners </strong>(brand shut down following acquisition by C9 in 2024)</li>
</ul>



<p>Because the Call of Duty League has a franchised structure, the teams won’t ever really change that much. There are plenty of teams outside of the CDL that deserve a spot on this list, though:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lore</strong></li>



<li><strong>OMiT</strong></li>



<li><strong>Decimate</strong></li>



<li><strong>WaR</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-are-cod-esports-played">How are COD Esports Played?</h2>



<p>Traditionally, Call of Duty esports won’t change too dramatically year-over-year. The game modes that are represented in these tournaments have remained the same for a very long time, and usually, only one mode will be dynamic.</p>



<p>Three core game modes make up the beating heart of COD esports: Search and Destroy, Hardpoint, and Control. Usually, each match will be a ‘best-of-five’, except for a grand final in a tournament, which tends to be a best-of-seven or even a best-of-nine. That means that most often, the first team to win three ‘maps’ will be crowned the victor.</p>



<p>Every team has four players and a coach, and almost every event known in the Call of Duty space is played on PC rather than on consoles. Players are only allowed to use controllers in COD esports, which has led some diehard esports fanatics to question the ‘legitimacy’ of the skill levels of COD players.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-call-of-duty">Can You Bet on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty is one of the more popular games when it comes to esports betting, particularly in North America and the United Kingdom. The most populated event for COD betting is the Call of Duty League, which has plenty of market coverage across the staggering variety of esports betting sites out there.</p>

<p>Making a career as a professional Fortnite player is not something that happens overnight. Many pro players did not find success until later seasons in the game’s lifecycle. The majority of these players’ success can be attributed to their Fortnite settings in-game – that’s why we’ve compiled a catch-all guide to the top Fortnite pro player settings.</p>



<p>Making sure you have the best Fortnite settings is optimal if you want to make a career within the competitive world of this immensely popular battle royale game.</p>



<p>Here are the top Fortnite pro player settings.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-settings-for-fortnite">Best Settings For Fortnite</h2>



<p>While specific Fortnite settings vary among different pro players, there are still a few that are considered the best Fortnite settings if you plan on competing within the game.</p>



<p>If you are playing Fortnite just to have fun and want to enjoy some good graphics, then none of this is for you. But if you want to play at your best ability with the least amount of screen tear and lag, then following these Fortnite pro player settings is highly recommended.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>From different equipment to settings within the game, here are the best Fortnite esports settings.</p>







<h2 id="h-display-settings-for-fortnite-esports">Display Settings For Fortnite Esports</h2>



<p>Having the best display settings in Fortnite is crucial for a smooth competitive experience. Unless you have the strongest and fastest PC in the world, then you will want to make sure you use the most optimal display settings when playing the game.</p>



<h4 id="h-settings-to-low">Settings to low:</h4>



<p>This is not an understatement. Everything that allows you to turn it to low, do so. This means options like Textures, Digital Image Processing, Effects and View distance should be turned to low. The lower you have them the less CPU your computer needs to use, giving you the best frame rate possible.</p>



<h4 id="h-frame-rate">Frame Rate:</h4>



<p>Depending on your computer and your monitor, limit your frame rate! If you allow it to go too high for your PC then you are risking screen tear issues. If you have a 144 hz monitor, then there is no reason to let your FPS run any higher. </p>



<h4 id="h-performance-mode">Performance Mode:</h4>



<p>Performance Mode is the route you want to take when playing competitive Fortnite. Many of the top Fortnite pro players use this setting. Performance Mode basically lowers everything to optimize the game’s performance.</p>



<h4 id="h-anti-aliasing">Anti-Aliasing:</h4>



<p>Turn Anti-Aliasing off.</p>



<h4 id="h-resolution">Resolution:</h4>



<p>Your resolution can stay at 1920×1080. Just be sure to follow the guidelines above for the best experience possible.</p>



<h4 id="h-additional-fortnite-settings">Additional Fortnite Settings:</h4>



<p>Settings such as VSync, Motion Blur and Ray Tracing can be turned off. The majority of these will already be set to off when switched to Performance Mode, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-keybinds">Keybinds</h2>



<p>There are no specific keybinds that are considered the best. Every Fortnite pro player has different keybinds set up. It just depends on what works best for the player.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The best advice is to watch a few of your favourite Fortnite pro players and study their keybinds, then try out a few and see which feels the best for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-keyboard-and-mouse-or-controller">Keyboard and Mouse or Controller?</h2>



<p>While many believe it simply just matters what you grew up on, a keyboard and mouse is the recommended way to play Fortnite if you want to be a pro player. In fact, in 2023 at the Fortnite Globals in Denmark, only one duo out of the 50 used a controller.</p>



<p>It is just a simple fact that reaction time can be displayed differently (faster) with a keyboard and mouse, making it the optimal way to play the game.</p>



<p>Overall, the top Fortnite settings may vary a bit across different pro players within the esport, but a large majority of players follow everything listed above. Many specifics, though, such as mouse sensitivity and more, are best figured out by the player.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-fortnite-pro-settings-for-ps5">Best Fortnite Pro Settings For PS5 </h3>



<p>Unfortunately, consoles allow for very little leeway when it comes to changing settings within the game. Display settings will have to be kept as is, making it much more difficult to compete with PC players. This guide might address the PlayStation 5, but the rules are mostly the same when you’re hunting for the best Fortnite settings for PS4.</p>



<p>But for those competing in the PlayStation Cups, there are still a few settings you can change to have the advantage.</p>



<p><strong>Fortnite PS5 Controller Settings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Builder Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>Builder Pro allows players to build much easier, while still having the necessary settings to fight in combat. </p>



<p>Make sure to also have your build sensitivity much higher than your aim sensitivity when establishing your Fortnite settings on the PS5. This allows you to build faster while still having control over your aim.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-fortnite-pro-settings-for-xbox-series-x-s">Best Fortnite Pro Settings for Xbox Series X|S</h3>



<p>The Xbox Series X|S follows the same pro settings guide as the PS5 does. Unfortunately, though, Fortnite does not have an Xbox-only tournament, but there is a yearly Console Cup that Xbox players can compete in. </p>



<p>Again, this part of the guide is for the Xbox Series X|S but it still applies if you’re looking for the best Fortnite settings for Xbox One.</p>



<p><strong>Fortnite Xbox Controller Settings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Builder Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>Similar to PlayStation, Xbox players should have their controllers set to Builder Pro and their build sensitivity much higher than their aim sensitivity.</p>

Now, let’s begin the Character Edition Showcase.</p><p><strong>■ Synopsis</strong></p><p>First, here is a synopsis of the story. On a special mission to save the prince, the protagonist attends the king’s funeral to assassinate the mastermind, the great <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal Louis. Suddenly, the giant face of the supposedly dead king appears in the sky over the Royal Capital, and the “election magic” is triggered. “Whoever can win the most support from the people by the deadline will be the next king.” Thus began an unprecedented uprising for the throne, allowing the citizens to be a candidate to become the next king.</p><p>Gathering popular support is not an easy task for regular citizens who have no electoral experience. That is when Sanctifex Forden of the Sanctus Church, a leading figure in the country, declares the “Tournament for the Throne” as an opportunity for people to put their powers on display and gather support. In this “Tournament for the Throne,” those who have put themselves forward as candidates for king are tasked to visit the major cities in the kingdom, proving their worth to the public as they tackle tough challenges. The first destination, Port Brielhaven, will host the “Exhibition of the Brave,” in which candidates compete to see who can bring in the biggest monster head. Those who make it through will head to Altabury Heights to take on the next challenge.</p><p>It is Batlin, a Sanctus crier, who is responsible for informing the public about the Tournament for the Throne, which has become a truly national event. His lighthearted play-by-play keeps the public engaged in the tournament.</p><p><strong>■ Candidates Vying for the Throne</strong></p><p>Now, in this national election campaign, candidates with various agendas come forward. The two most powerful men leading the tournament from unassailable positions are Forden and the protagonist’s arch-nemesis, Louis.</p><p><strong>Forden</strong></p><p>Forden is the supreme authority of Sanctism, the state religion of the United Kingdom of Euchronia, and is also the head of the Crown Theocracy, the government ruled with Sanctism at its center. In the turmoil following the sudden death of the previous king, he has garnered wide support from the population, given his position as the leader of the moderate faction.</p><p><strong>Louis</strong></p><p>Louis, on the other hand, in contrast to the moderate Forden, is an army officer with military prowess who believes in true meritocracy, wielding overwhelming combat and magical skills that enable him to defeat the humans. His policy of valuing skill and rationality over birth or circumstance has garnered tremendous support, especially among radical youths.</p><p>Of course, these two are not the only ones who will be competing in the Royal Tournament campaign. Other candidates also put their names forward in the campaign, each with their own quirky platforms.</p><p><strong>Gideaux</strong></p><p>The first one I would like to introduce is Gideaux. He is Forden’s primary bodyguard, as well as the Captain of the Monk Army, the enforcement arm of the Crown Theocracy. He himself does not intend to be king, but he doesn’t seem to take kindly to the arrival of the “filthy” elda protagonist.</p><p><strong>Godell</strong></p><p>Next, Godell. Known as “Godell the Black Hound,” he is Louis’ subordinate, but is a rather ambitious man who is running for election on the platform of rising to power. He makes no effort to hide his open hostility, which may eventually become a thorny issue for you.</p><p><strong>Milo</strong></p><p>One of the oddballs is Milo of the ishkia tribe, who preaches an agenda where those of beauty will strip all the hideous of their titles. Wherever he goes, you’re bound to hear the high-pitched screams of his fans.</p><p><strong>Loveless</strong></p><p>Next, the third son of a tavern owner, with the slogan of “All you can drink all year round.” Without giving much thought to the future of the kingdom, some might be tempted to agree with Loveless’ pledge, which falls in line with his hedonistic paripus traits.</p><p><strong>Rudolf</strong></p><p>Rudolf, another bloodthirsty candidate .He pledges to establish a roussainte military dictatorship. His appeal for greater control of the roussainte tribe seems to have attracted the support of those who feel repressed by the rule of moderate clemars.</p><p><strong>Lina</strong></p><p>Lina, a eugief candidate and the only daughter of the family that runs the Kayden Workshop, is participating to promote the gauntlet runner family business. </p><p><strong>Goddard</strong></p><p>Goddard, a demolitionist of the rhoag tribe, is a representative of the elderly, with his pledge to give preferential treatment to the old and tax the young.</p><p><strong>Roger</strong></p><p>Roger, a young man of the clemar tribe, believes in his own righteousness and is pushing forward with his vision of a truly free country with no taxes, no laws, and no religion</p><p><strong>Jin</strong></p><p>Jin from the nidia tribe is intent on winning no matter what, changing his campaign pledge depending on where he goes and who he needs to please at the moment.</p><p><strong>Julian</strong></p><p>We also have Julian of the ishkia tribe who is very conscious about pro-animal rights even when it comes to monsters that threaten people. </p><p><strong>Edeni</strong></p><p>Edeni, an island chief of the mustari tribe, decides to participate in the tournament as a pagan advocate for religious freedom.</p><p>And others with various agendas and objectives will appear.</p><p>As you can see, the “Tournament for the Throne” has a festive aspect with a truly diverse field of rival candidates. But maybe Gallica is right. If one of these candidates become king, the country will face bigger problems.</p><p>The candidates we’ve introduced are all powerful people who have expensive gauntlet runners at their disposal. And I think you will find that there are many who want to represent the tribe they come from and increase their influence. However, some of these rivals are so impacted by the protagonist’s <a title="Genres > Action [2,042 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s down the line that they later become his supporters. I won’t go into detail now, but I hope you will look forward to that as well. Posters highlighting the candidates’ pledges are posted in cities with influential power. You may want to listen to people’s opinions as you walk the streets to see what they think of the candidates’ promises and claims made in speeches.</p><p>During the election period, the protagonist’s popularity ranking in the race can be checked by pressing a specific button in the overworld. At the beginning, the protagonist’s support ranking starts in a rather low position, around 8,121st place as you see here. This is not a <a title="Genres > Simulation [529 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation game</a> where the popularity ranking fluctuates in real time, so it is only a flavor element of the game. But these rankings will change significantly as the campaign progresses.</p><p>The protagonist is a nobody at the lowest level in the country. Of course, he is not the kind of person that anyone would expect to be king. You will feel the dynamics of this royal tournament campaign as you watch the ranking gradually change with the results of completing your missions and through your actions towards the people of the city!</p><p><strong>■ Followers that Support the Protagonist</strong></p><p>Now, while there are rivals in the tournament who stand in the protagonist’s way, there are also encouraging allies who will support your campaign. In the cities that the protagonist will stay at, there are many people with various kinds of problems. By listening to them and helping them, they will become strong supporters of the protagonist.</p><p>Of course, the allies who travel with him, such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, are also important supporters of the protagonist. But he will also meet unique supporters on his journey who do not directly participate in battle. The unique feature of interacting with supporters, or followers as we call them in this title, is that you can acquire powerful Archetypes that you can equip and use in battle.</p><p>Let us now introduce you to what kinds of followers we have.</p><p><strong>Brigitta</strong></p><p>First, there is a rhoag follower named Brigitta who owns an ignitor shop in the Royal Capital. She notices that the protagonist is an elda and asks him to take on a quest to test his strength. If you can complete said request and gain her trust, she will be a powerful follower. When she becomes a follower, the protagonist will not only be able to awaken to the Merchant Archetype, which offers more rewards in battle, but he will also be able to make purchases at the ignitor shop in the Royal Capital, which is usually not available to the elda.</p><p><strong>Maria</strong></p><p>Next is a girl named Maria who lives at the Hushed Honeybee Inn located in the Royal Capital. Separated from her parents and having no friends due to her rhoag and ishkia mixed background, she eagerly awaits the souvenir of stories that the protagonists bring back through encounters they have on their travels. If you can help her feel less lonely, she will also be a powerful follower. The bond with Maria awakens the Healer Archetype, which specializes in healing and purification.</p><p><strong>Bardon</strong></p><p>Next is Bardon, a roussainte who is the captain of the guard corps in Martira. He is a simple, clumsy, but likeable and earnest man who faces new problems after an incident that happens in his town is solved. By supporting him, he will become a strong follower. Your bond with him awakens the Commander Archetype, which can bend the flow of battles to your will.</p><p><strong>Alonzo</strong></p><p>Like Bardon, we meet Alonzo in Martira, an elusive and enigmatic young man of the nidia tribe. His smooth talk leads the protagonist to undertake a certain quest. Even though he swings the protagonist around with his words and actions that go back and forth, he ends up being a one-of-a-kind follower. If you can strengthen your bond with him, you will be able to awaken the Faker, that can be used as a trump card to tackle difficult enemies.</p><p><strong>Catherina</strong></p><p>Last but not least is Catherina, a bounty hunter. She is one of the protagonist’s followers, but she is also a candidate herself who stands up for her tribe—the paripus—which is often looked down upon, with the pledge to make them wealthier. From the bond you form with her, you can awaken the Brawler Archetype, which can deliver decisive blows. While they may be rivals in the campaign together, they do form a strong bond, allowing the protagonist and Catherina to create a unique relationship. We invite you to see for yourself how the competition between the candidates will play out.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Party [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> Members</strong></p><p>In addition to the followers introduced here, you can also bond with fellow party members such as Strohl and Hulkenberg, and build a follower relationship with them. Interacting with characters of all ages, tribes, and values, and from different perspectives, will give you a new experience unlike any you have had in previous titles.</p><p>Strengthening bonds with followers can lead to the evolution of Archetypes to higher levels and the unlocking of abilities that will give you a strategic advantage. So please be proactive and talk to your followers when you see them in town or in gauntlet runners. You can check the status of your interactions with your followers, as well as the Archetypes and abilities you have acquired through them, at any time in the main menu, which will help you strategize how to use your time during the operation periods.</p><p>In addition, the follower characters are also voiced by talented voice actors, which we believe will provide a deeper game experience.</p><p><strong>■ Closing</strong></p><p>How did you like it? We are pleased to announce that we have released new information on quite a few characters. Was there a character you liked among the unique candidates and followers? Let us know your favorite in the comments.</p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of this game system is the fact that the bonding process increases the number of very powerful Archetypes. Thinking about what battles you can fight with the Archetypes you acquire from the followers you meet will play a large role in your strategies. It is up to you, the player, to choose a follower in favor of strategy or choose a follower whose circumstances are of interest to you. It is well worth giving thought to, so I hope you look forward to it.</p><p>Up to this point, we have introduced the battle system, the dungeons, the story, and the characters. However, a new and different aspect of <em>Metaphor</em> is the element of enjoying daily activities on your journey. In the next Showcase, I will finally introduce the journey aspect in detail, so please stay tuned.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled for release this fall on October 11, 2024. Both the physical and digital editions are available for pre-orders, so please pre-order your copy or add it to your wishlist. Along with the standard edition, a Digital Deluxe Edition commemorating the 35th anniversary of the ATLUS brand is also available. You can also get additional pre-order bonuses, so make sure to pre-order today. See you at the next ATLUS Exclusive Showcase! Thank you very much for your time today!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While Rowling did not directly contribute to Quidditch Champions, she benefits monetarily from sales for the game. In 2022, US Quidditch and Major League Quidditch--real sports leagues inspired by the fictional game--<a href="https://www.usquadball.org/news/quidditch-changes-name-to-quadball" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rebranded to Quadball in response to Rowling's transphobic statements</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/how-to-make-movie-theater-popcorn-flavacol-secret-ingredient<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re like me, you enjoy a snack of popped corn while watching a movie. And if you’re also like me, you like experimenting at home with flavors. Popcorn toppers, real butter, ghee, heck I know some hippies out there love nutritional yeast. But if you want to recreate the genuine “movie theater” popcorn, do what the pros do: spend 10 bucks and get yourself some Flavacol.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I love additional profits! Credit: <a href="https://shop.gmpopcorn.com/products/original-flavacol-2045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gold Medal</a></figcaption></figure><p>Flavacol comes in a big 32 ounce milk carton that looks like it has not changed since Eisenhower was in office. Gold Medal, the company that makes it, has been making <a href="https://www.gmpopcorn.com/company/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carnival-adjacent snack supplies since 1931</a>. It’s made in Cincinnati, which is exactly where I want my artificial popcorn flavoring to be made. The side of the carton implores the reader “FOR <em>additional </em>PROFITS TRY THESE GOLD MEDAL PROFIT-MAKERS: Sno-Kones®, COTTON CANDY, NACHOS, HOT DOGS &amp; MORE!.” This is the industrial stuff they use in theaters, it’s a radioactive orange powder that is roughly the same hue as the cheese that comes with Kraft.&nbsp;</p><p>The ingredients in Flavacol are essentially salt, flavors and coloring. It costs less than 10 dollars for about 32 ounces or 827 servings, and unless you are running a theater you will not run out of it for several years. Part of what makes Flavacol work is that popcorn salt is very finely ground, so unlike table salt it permeates every single nook and cranny of the kernel. It gives the popcorn a&nbsp; light orange hue and that “movie” taste that we all know and love. They sell <a href="https://shop.gmpopcorn.com/collections/popcorn-supplies?_=pf&amp;pf_v_brand=Flavacol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several varieties of Flavacol</a> including a “Better Butter” variant, “Premier” variant without yellow #5, and a Color Free version that comes in a 4 pound bucket. I just stick to the normal stuff because I bought it once and have no reason to get anything else until retirement.</p><figure><figcaption>I only have the stuff on the left because I bought it once and have not needed anything else. Credit: Golden Medal.</figcaption></figure><p>There are many ways to prepare popcorn, but I prefer a <a href="https://www.whirleypopshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whirley Pop</a> over an air popper. It’s a big aluminum kettle you put on your stove. It has a crank that you can use to constantly agitate the kernels while also mixing in whatever oil and additives you want. The Whirley Pop is cheap, and simple and unless you need an <a href="https://www.whirleypopshop.com/products/whirley-pop-stovetop-popcorn-popper-with-metal-gears-stainless-steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">induction-compatible model</a> or are afraid of aluminum it’s your best bet for the money.&nbsp;ew</p><figure><figcaption>Traded my air popper in for one of these ages ago and I have never looked back. Credit: Whirley Pop</figcaption></figure><p>People are very particular about their popcorn workflow, so feel free to experiment with your preferred oil and salt ratio, as well as the order of operation for when to add your Flavacol. Some people prefer to use special butter flavored popcorn oil. Those people are valid, but for my money you can’t go wrong with Flavacol and coconut oil, the preferred combo of many popcorn enthusiasts. Ghee is nice to experiment with as well, and it’s shelf stable so easy to keep around. I have heard from fellow “corn heads” that a <a href="https://www.popcornsupply.com/stainless-steel-dredge-salt-shaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stainless steel dredge</a> is also nice to have, since it’s cheap and easy to get at a restaurant supply store, but you can do without it. You can also get a big reusable tub so you can pretend your living room is the weird independent multiplex near your house that’s slightly cheaper for some reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Popcorn itself is a surprisingly deep rabbit hole, too deep to discuss here, but if you have an opportunity, at the very least experiment with different popcorn varieties. <a href="https://amishcountrypopcorn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amish Country</a> is a good supplier and they sell big sampler boxes of all their different varieties, but you should at least give Mushroom a shot – it’s the big puff ball one that you usually see in kettle and caramel corn. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popcorn/comments/thru38/mushroom_or_butterfly_discuss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some people love it, some hate it,</a> and I personally go back and forth between that and the standard butterfly depending on my mood and toppings.</p><p>Happy cornin’.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> come in a lot of different themes, but war is one of the most popular ones. And for good reason – war board games can be incredibly fun and exciting. All of the games below will give you a feeling of epic battle. Some may do it in an evening, some may take all day, but none of them will sell you short on battle strategy along the way. Gather some friends, get the snacks and drinks together, and settle in for a long haul thrill ride.</p><p>Here are a few tips to help longer games run smoothly: If you can, get a PDF copy of the rulebook (most publishers make them freely available) and have everyone read it before the game. Insist players do "admin" tasks like sorting their hands or counters outside their turn. You may also want to impose a time limit per turn if all players agree. Now, on with the games!</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best War Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#blood-rage">Blood Rage</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#dune">Dune</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy / Undaunted: North Africa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#root">Root</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</a></li></ul><h2 id="sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h2><div id="164399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Fans of the video game series might be surprised by the close-quarters action depicted in this tabletop adaptation, but that shouldn’t discourage you from its considerable charms. The stealth aspects are wholly intact, as the sniper player is trying to stay slow and silent while up against a punishing clock, and the roving squads controlled by the German player who are trying to sniff him out. In addition to that ever-escalating tension, it’s also got a sense of historical veneer that the video game lacks, with thematic components and more realistic combat. The game comes with two different boards and a variety of sniper loadout options and squad specialists for the German player, ensuring it’s got tons of replay value and tactical decision-making to explore.</p><h2 id="twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</h2><div id="158887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition</h3></p></div><p>Games don't get more epic than this all-day affair of sci-fi civilization building. It's got everything you could want from the genre. A range of bizarre aliens research technology and build fleets to fight over a random galactic hex map. There's inter-player diplomacy, of course, but also in-game political decrees to vote on. Yet while dealmaking is important, it rests on a rock-solid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic core</a> to challenge you. The strategy card system, where each player picks a special focus each round, is a particular mechanical gem. This fourth edition retains the sweeping scope but trims lots of fat, making it more accessible. </p><h2 id="blood-rage">Blood Rage</h2><div id="196921" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Blood Rage</h3></p></div><p>In Blood Rage, you control a Viking clan heading into the end times of Ragnarök and trying to gain as much rage, axes and horns as they can to win glory for their warriors and a place in Valhalla. As delightfully angsty as that all sounds, the violent exterior and great-looking components hide a game of considerable strategic subtlety. You’ll be drafting cards to support your actions each round, carefully marshaling your limited supply of warriors and monsters to try and pillage map regions and fulfill quests to earn that all-important glory. Of course, everyone else has the same designs, so you’ll frequently be fighting them for the privilege using an exciting blind battle card system. A fantastic blend of tactical challenge, theme and outright brutality, this is a definitive conflict-based classic.</p><h2 id="dune">Dune</h2><div id="158888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dune</h3></p></div><p>Dune is a very different kind of futuristic game, (not to be confused with <a href="https://zdcs.link/PjB0D?_ga=398378208.1708462773&amp;object_uuid=0abb9d39-5c55-4637-acfd-0bb89acb5f8b&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a>). Based on Frank Herbert's famous novel and first released in 1979, it was years ahead of its time. There's little randomness in Dune. Instead, the game rests on a fascinating balance of hidden information and asymmetrical strategy.</p><p>Each player takes the role of a faction from the book, with asymmetric special powers. The Atreides, for example, get to peek at cards as they're auctioned off blind, while the wicked Harkonnen know all the secret traitors in play. The result is an astonishing evocation of the narrative and political themes of the novel. This new edition has cleaner rules and spanking art.</p><h2 id="kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</h2><div id="196922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kemet Blood and Sand</h3></p></div><p>Imagine all the gods and mythical creatures of ancient Egypt were real, and that they came down to the desert sands one day to tear each other into itty-bitty pieces. That’s Kemet. You could talk about the tech pyramids that allow you to tailor your strategy with special powers across attack and defense, and feed those into your board play. You could talk about how everyone starts with the same battle cards to use in fights, leading to terrible mind games as you try and out-guess what your opponent will play and what they’ll discard. But mostly this is all about out-and-out violence at a breathtaking pace, as the peculiar board layout means there’s no hiding, and everyone is a mere skip away from tearing everyone else’s mummified guts out.</p><h2 id="rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars: Rebellion takes a more liberal approach to reconstruct a favorite franchise on your table. It's clearly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars</a>. The Rebellion player is the underdog, trying to survive militarily while winning planets over to their cause. The Empire, meanwhile, wields the power of huge armies to crush the slightest sign of dissent. It's a fascinating asymmetric struggle, peopled by well-known characters and events from the movies. But beyond the famous faces, the unfolding narrative is up to you. It's all woven together with tight strategic strings to ensure each turn is full of challenge and variety.</p><h2 id="conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</h2><div id="196924" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Conflict of Heroes: Awakening The Bear</h3></p></div><p>Tactical wargames, where the action is depicted at the level of squads or individual soldiers, are a tricky genre to get right. There’s so much detail available that it’s easy to get bogged down in over-complex systems, which, in turn, slow down what should be a pulse-pounding encounter. No game gets the balance better than the Conflict of Heroes series, which uses a simple system of action points, dice and differing front and rear defense values to offer players excitement, realism and tactical challenge all in one neat package. While it starts out simple, it soon expands to include artillery, vehicles and tanks for a full World War 2 experience. And the command point system, a tiny pool of extra actions you can invoke during your opponent’s turn, is a stroke of genius, with every point spent feeling like giving blood.  </p><h2 id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy &amp; Undaunted: North Africa</h2><div><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><div id="158885" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><div id="173903" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted Stalingrad</h3></p></div></div><p>While in no way a simulation, the way these games leverage the deck building genre to conjure the tactics of infantry combat from just a few rules is astonishing. Officer cards let you add new unit cards to your deck, imitating the issuing of orders and supplies to soldiers in the field. Those unit cards, meanwhile, let you move the matching troop counters on the modular scenario map, fighting the enemy and seizing objectives. Casualties thin your deck, making units less able to act as their morale erodes under fire. With tense firefights and pivotal moments aplenty, you won't find a more accessible or engaging way to refight the Second World War. </p><h2 id="root">Root</h2><div id="155278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p>One of the shorter games on the list, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-review">Root</a> is a bold design that throws asymmetry to the fore. There are four factions fighting for control of the woodland realm, each with its own unique rules and feel. The Marquise de Cat and the Eyrie play standard, if quite different, conquest games. The Woodland Folk are guerrilla fighters against those invaders. Finally, the Vagabond is a lone trickster-hero. Don't let the cute theme and quirky art put you off – this is a red-blooded game of brutal strategy, where each play asks big questions about politics and governance in the real world.</p><h2 id="twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h2><div id="196923" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h3></p></div><p>The original Twilight Struggle is often counted among the best board games ever made, but there’s a problem: It’s complex and takes three or four hours to play. This version keeps the core card-play of the original that made it so compelling, with players facing endless dilemmas whether to risk triggering key events for their opponent as they navigate their hand of cards, but cranks down the play time to a mere hour or so. It’s still full of meaty, awkward decisions to navigate, but a new scoring mechanic helps ratchet up the excitement in the shorter game. And for history buffs there’s the chance to explore this little-known corner of the Cold War as it unfolded in East Africa, with real historical events simulated on the player’s cards through the game mechanics, and a book of designer’s notes to illuminate their view of the history.</p><h2 id="got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h2><div id="158891" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Speaking of politics, this game recreates all the conniving and backstabbing of the books and TV show. To do so, it borrows a trick from classic Diplomacy: only one player can win, but no player has the resources to win alone. Alliances and eventual treachery are thus inevitable, keeping everyone on a knife-edge. It's governed by a thrilling secret order system, meaning you can't know your opponent's intentions until it's too late. Atop this time-tested formula are lots of sweet bells and whistles from the world of Westeros to add strategic interest. A great game in its own right, it's a must for fans of the franchise. </p><h2 id="war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</h2><div id="158892" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>War of the Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p>Another top game for lovers of the source material, this is by far the best of the many attempts to board-game Tolkien. At its heart is a brilliant division into two games on the same board. First is the epic clash of armies across Middle-earth, as the free peoples wake up and resist the threat of the dark lord Sauron. Beneath is the quest of the Fellowship to throw the One Ring into the fire before Sauron conquers all. The genius of this design is the way the two halves interweave at every turn, leaving a tricky tactical balancing act for players to master.</p><h2 id="eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</h2><div id="158886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Eclipse: 2nd Dawn for The Galaxy</h3></p></div><p>While the Twilight Imperium series has tended to emphasise warfare and diplomacy over long-term planning, Eclipse attempts to bring more strategy to sci-fi civilization-building. Smart systems for initiative and technology upgrades mean you’re always having to look several steps ahead as you branch out from your starting hex into the unknown reaches of the galaxy. That tactical depth doesn’t detract from the feeling of exploring the cosmos, designing ships and taking the fight to your opponents. It’s just that when you get there, you need to be more reliant on having the right tech and the right units than falling back on the luck of the dice. </p><p><em>If you like these, be sure to check out our picks for the overall </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><em>best board games</em></a><em> and the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><em>best board game deals</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>What Counts as a Wargame?</h2><p>In hobby circles, “wargame” is a surprisingly loaded term. Folk who spend a lot of time in gaming circles tend to use it to exclusively refer to a small genre of games that simulate historical conflicts. Although it’s a niche interest, a lot of titles that fit the bill are published every year, often commanding high prices for boxes that contain map sheets and dozens of cardboard counters, because the major effort in getting these games to market is the detailed historical research required. Awakening the Bear and Twilight Struggle: Red Sea are our examples from our list, and they’re at the more approachable end of the genre.</p><p>However, even in this apparently neat definition, there’s room for a lot of grey areas. A few games seek to bring the simulation angle to conflicts that might have happened, but either didn’t, or haven’t, such as the Cold War erupting into World War 3. Others, like Undaunted, take the historical setting but have limited interest in being simulations. Finally, the smallest group of all are games that try to be realistic about entirely fantastic or science-fiction scenarios. Do any of these count as “wargames”? Some gamers will say yes, others no.</p><p>Fundamentally, of course, these kinds of semantic discussions are of limited interest to anyone who doesn’t play these kinds of games. So we’ve gone for the widest possible definition, which is games that explore conflict from a variety of different perspectives, from historical simulation to fantasy diplomacy. But if a particular subsection of conflict games appeals to you, and you want to explore it further, there will be enthusiast sites out there to help you.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning.939960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
2024’s small but growing avalanche of games that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-we-just-went-an-entire-year-where-every-game-was-as-short-cheap-and-existentially-harrowing-as-clickolding-thatd-be-great-thanks">trap you in a room with a nasty little freak</a> continues with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arsonate">Arsonate</a>, in which the nasty little freak wears a gasmask and wants to set you on fire. He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trouble is, you can only flip cards on your half of the board, with the conflagration beginning in the middle. So "set you on fire" is wrong, actually: the gist of Arsonate is to carefully sculpt a mutually threatening blaze so that you get incinerated <em>last</em>. Integral to this are fire cards that trigger events. These range from giving you an extra turn – typically, not very welcome – to awarding you a random utility you can use to twist the odds. 
</p>
<p>
Utilities emerge from a weird little dumbwaiter to left of the table, and must be secured in a locker before you can play them. They include fire extinguishers, which let you re-flip a fire card, spy-glasses, which let you peek beneath a tree card, and crowbars, which let you steal a utility from one of your opponent's lockers. Don’t worry, he’ll happily do the same to you: on normal difficulty, the game tells you outright that your enemy loves to cheat. Utilities are executed with pleasing literalness: I have yet to win any real-life cardgames by embedding a fireaxe in the table, but I'm keen to try it during my next round of Cosmic Encounters.
</p>
<p>
Each game of Arsonate should take under 30 minutes, and there are three possible endings. It’s all obviously reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">Buckshot Roulette</a>, a named influence <a href="https://nashset.itch.io/arsonate-demo">on the Itch.io page</a>, and less obviously of Inscryption, though I’m not sure the demo is as gripping as either. Arsonate’s Host doesn’t have the abject animatronic wrongness of Buckshot’s dealer, and the card game isn't as viscous with flourishes and variables as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>’s equivalent. Still, it <em>is</em> a demo, and it’s getting there.</p>
<p>Why do we like video games that trap us inside with a nasty little freak? I wonder if it’s down to the suspicion that most video game developers are nasty little freaks. "Entertainers", my eye - video game developers are Cartesian demons who immerse us in predatory stagecraft and perform mean tricks on us from behind the veil of code. In games such as this, you can at least savour the pretence of confronting the sadistic fucker and, if you play your fireaxes right, cooking their goose.
</p>
<p>Arsonate is also on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2822980/ARSONATE/">Steam</a> - there's no release date yet. Question for the thread: favourite fire system in a game? I’ll see your oh-so-predictable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-far-cry-2-is-the-best-in-the-series">Far Cry 2 shoutout</a> and raise you one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games leaker tez2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1817699079876407495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> today that Grand Theft Auto V may soon launch on PC Game Pass. The game has previously been on Xbox Game Pass, but only for consoles; it would be the first time on PC.</p>
<p>While the addition of such a high-profile game is always welcome, it is doubtful many gamers would still need to take advantage. Grand Theft Auto V launched on PC on April 14, 2015, nearly two years after its debut on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It's been available for over nine years on various stores, such as Steam, the Epic Games Store (where it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-free-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> to grab for a limited time back in 2020), and Rockstar's own launcher. Moreover, it's currently priced at just $15. The PC version is also still behind the next-gen console version, which was enhanced with ray traced ambient occlusion and shadows a while ago.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is currently the second best-selling premium game of all time, having recently broken the milestone of 200 million units sold. Only Minecraft, with its estimated 300 million units sold, stands above it; of course, it has a much larger target audience than Rockstar's M-rated game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto V did not receive any single player DLCs. There was at least one in production featuring the character Trevor, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-rockstar-dev-says-kick-ass-gta-v-standalone-trevor-dlc-was-scrapped-to-milk-gta-onlines-cash-cow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> aside in favor of GTA Online support once Rockstar noticed the incredible popularity of the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online itself is still regularly updated to this day. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>the Bottom Dollar Bounties update last month, and there's more to come throughout the Summer. As for Grand Theft Auto VI, the long-awaited sequel is slated to launch in Fall 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, while a PC version is likely coming around a year to a year and a half later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games"><u>best Star Wars board games</u></a>, you have a lot of great choices. The Queen’s Gambit, for instance, recreates the multi-front finale of The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: Rebellion captures the breadth of the original trilogy in a three-hour epic. The Mandalorian Adventures is the latest tabletop take on Star Wars, and it’s shooting for a somewhat smaller scope. This new release is content to capture several key moments from the first season of The Mandalorian, presenting these encounters as 40-minute firefights with color, tension, and a minimal amount of overhead. Just like the show upon which it’s based, this is a splendid slice of Star Wars that packs some new surprises while managing to call back to the spirit of the franchise. </p><div catalogid="068db5aa-26cf-442f-bd55-e367b98276dc" id="205353"><div id="205353" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Mandalorian Adventures Board Game</h3></p></div><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-adventure-book-game-review"><u>The Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game</u></a> immediately comes to mind, as the structure here is similar. Play is focused around a spiral-bound book that forms the board. Each new scenario moves on to a subsequent page, allowing for quick setup and minimal storage space. While there is a main rulebook, missions themselves introduce new rules and tweaks that are printed alongside the map. It’s a relatively seamless experience to work through the book and internalize the additional details.</p><p>The core system is simple and surprisingly interesting. Players cooperate to take down game-controlled foes and accomplish the scenario objective. You can choose between characters such as Mando, IG-11, and Greef Karga. Each possesses their own unique deck of cards and abilities. On your turn you perform two actions, but the effectiveness of each action is variable and depends on the card you play. So, if you play a four-strength card to move, then you will move four spaces. A two-strength card to attack means you inflict two damage, and so on. Some cards include special ability text that offers additional benefits. This system is interesting because it’s a blend of a straightforward two-action turn with variance in action points. Furthermore, the way enemy response plays off this card system is splendid.</p><p>These action cards are played in slots on the board. All of the cards any player spends to move go into the “move” slot, for instance. Once one of the slots receives a total of five or more strength total, the enemy phase triggers and a card is drawn. This emphasizes the strength of the game in presenting tense and nuanced systems with the absolute minimal amount of rules weight. It enforces timing constraints and facilitates discussion between players, because you may hold off on throwing down that powerful card so that one of your buddies gets to go before the enemies trigger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game.</p></div><p>This tension is important, as it’s the primary source of drama. All damage is set by the power of your attack card or the activation card drawn for the enemies. No dice are rolled, so the dynamism is entirely encapsulated in the card play. This works to increase the speed of the game and achieve that brief playtime at the expense of a more nuanced combat system. That makes sense, as this game is aimed at less experienced players as well as dedicated hobbyists.</p><p>Despite the relative simplicity, Mandalorian Adventures has an almost puzzle-like feel. The difficulty, while able to be tweaked, is formidable enough that it requires thought and discussion on how players will approach their turns. Often, you will use what information you have in combination with gut instinct to formulate a plan. Analyzing the board state is essential to success.</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects is in how it bridges the gap between those two levels of players. Each scenario is standalone, as this is not a campaign game. However, it wants you to engage the missions in order on your first playthrough. This is because there is an accompanying deck of cards that gives you step-by-step instructions on what to play next. It’s a key component in introducing new rules in bite-sized pieces, rules that you can then apply to all games going forward. New content is also added to play and the system adjustments are considerable. By your fifth session, the game will have grown quite a bit in density, but it will have been an effortless journey.</p><p>In addition to this large deck of cards, there are two full-sized envelopes. They contain additional ways to play or modify existing scenarios. Once you have finished revealing everything, you will have numerous ways to enjoy the game. It’s an interesting concept, one indicative of publisher Unexpected Games’ design philosophy. They presented a similar approach with their debut title, The Initiative (<a href="https://zdcs.link/BdvJv?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">see at Amazon</a>). That game also presented new content during the course of play and shook up expectations. </p><p>This methodology, of breaking up the experience into a gradual arc of play, and then throwing in several optional modules to re-experience existing scenarios, is very effective. One such example, mentioned in the game’s core rulebook and hence not technically a spoiler, is the inclusion of a traitor mode of play. This is a set of cards where players are given a randomized loyalty with the chance of one character being a traitor to the group. This is excellent as it touches upon the themes of trust and honor present in the television series. You can add these cards into any existing scenario to spice it up. This mode is completely optional and not the standard way to play. In fact, it’s probably best to hold off on this until you’ve played several sessions, as the traitor mode is somewhat fragile and can result in uneven plays. Yet, when it comes together with a perfectly timed reveal, it’s wonderfully cinematic. </p><p>There's a good deal of depth here in exploring the system and additional content. It manages to elevate the experience, achieving a status above the comparably mellow Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game. The Mandalorian Adventures is not likely to supplant Star Wars: Rebellion or Imperial Assault for fans of those more robust and weighty titles, but it’s a surprisingly devious game that captures a solid amount of tension with simple and interesting systems. It is very flexible, supporting solitaire play or even multiple participants sharing characters by shuffling all of the cards into a single deck. This really is a stellar box that offers much more than appears on the surface.</p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPWJO?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/weoVq?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eRXD?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Unexpected Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 29, 2024 7:43 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>This apparently modest board game unveils itself over multiple plays, presenting an escalating series of surprises that tweaks the overall ruleset through additional content.
