			<p>Getting Cyberpunk 2077 to run on Nintendo Switch 2 did not require a gigantic effort, although getting it to play well was among the challenges CD Projekt Red had to face during the port's development.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>, CD Projekt Red SVP of Business Jan Rosner revealed that the team managed to get the game running on Nintendo Switch 2 fairly quickly and without a gigantic effort. However, bigger challenges were to ensure the game would play well, use some of the Nintendo Switch 2's unique features, and that it suited the handheld format. With the game's disastrous launch on previous generation consoles in mind, CDPR wanted to ensure the game played well on the system, even with some visual compromises that, according to Rosner, don't impact the game's artistic vision. In this regard, the CDPR SVP of Business feels the team achieved their goal of having a big AAA RPG on the go playable from start to finish without making any <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch2-surpass-ps4-graphics/">significant compromises</a>.</p>
<p>The attention CD Projekt Red placed on the Nintendo Switch 2 release of Cyberpunk 2077 and the console's audience is well highlighted by the fact that the retail edition will include the full game on the cartridge and won't require any additional download. The team made this decision based on their experience with The Witcher 3 on the original Switch, which proved how important physical editions are for the Nintendo audience, and, as such, putting the entire game on the cartridge to offer a plug-and-play experience was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console debuts worldwide, with a few exceptions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-seikyu-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ace Entertainment and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, and it won't be long before you get to live an idyllic life amongst the yokai.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2340520/view/535474378243048018" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>will be arriving on PC via Steam Early Access on May 21st, and yes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">unlike&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, that's May 21st this year, not next.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, you'll be building your dream farmhouse, all while shapeshifting into various yokai forms in order to make exploration and day-to-day life easier. Think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spirittea" rel="nofollow"><em>Spirittea</em></a>, but where you get to transform into the creatures, and you're not a million miles away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-release-date-world.jpg?itok=9a3NF-5p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-release-date-world.jpg?itok=PyKN8ExZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>The game takes place on the titular island of Seikyu, where yokai residents "longing to freely express themselves in human form" dwell. Together with your sister Kon, you'll build a life among these mythical beings.</p>

<p>Forms you can shapeshift into over the course of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>include the Crow Tengu, which grants you flight, as well as the water-dwelling Slime and the farmland-tending Boar.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a life sim like this, you can grow and tend to crops, raise livestock, and build your homestead, kitting it out with custom-crafted furniture to add that all-important personal touch. Of course, you can also cook meals from the ingredients you grow and source from the local area.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>also features a romance system, with "a variety of romanceable partners" available, each of whom has "their own unique personalities and heartwarming stories". The game's "extraordinary" villagers will have a range of quests for you to complete as well.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2340520/Tales_of_Seikyu/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 21st. There's no word of a console release for the game yet.</p>

Again, how reflective that is of the finished game remains to be seen, but Rockstar Games has certainly earned itself the benefit of the doubt in many quarters over the years, especially between <em>GTA V </em>and <em>Red Dead Redemption VI</em>. The footage was running on a PlayStation 5, which is also a boon to those worried the game might only really pop on a PS5 Pro (it’ll also be on Xbox Series X/S but a PC port won’t be ready at launch).</p><p>We’ll see if that widespread enthusiasm remains once the game’s price is announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">With Microsoft</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">and Nintendo</a></span> both moving to $80 for their most premium games, it’s not inconceivable now that <em>GTA 6 </em>could blow past that and come in at $100 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553">as some analysts have speculated</a></span>, potentially with an even higher price tag for early access or other deluxe edition bonuses.

Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him.

Jason’s friend and a fellow associate of Brian’s, Cal feels safest hanging at home, snooping on Coast Guard comms with a few beers and some private browser tabs open.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The psychopaths are in charge.

One of the few to transform his time in the streets into a legitimate empire spanning real estate, a strip club, and a recording studio — Boobie's all smiles until it's time to talk business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Top quality cuts. Boobie might seem like he's just out for himself, but it's his partnership with the young aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan for Only Raw Records that he's most invested in — now they just need a hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Boobie Ike Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Dre'Quan Priest</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Only Raw...

Viral hooks. Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez have been friends since high school — girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One hit away from fame. An early hit single with local rapper DWNPLY took Real Dimez to new heights.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/06/rockstar-just-unveiled-the-second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Grand Theft Auto VI is the gaming industry's most anticipated game, but after <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/02/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-to-may-2026">last Friday's news that it would be delayed into May of next year</a>, it seemed like it would be a while before we saw any new details about the game. Today, Rockstar decided to surprise the internet once more, but with good news this time: a second trailer. You can check it out below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This trailer spends a bit more time introducing the audience to Jason Duval, the game's male protagonist, by giving us a glimpse into his day to day life. It seems to be as much about showing off the new and improved Vice City, as Jason lifts weights on the beach, cruises down the highway, and avoids police at night. Eventually, he picks up Lucia Caminos, the other protagonist, from prison, and the game wastes no time showing how head over heels they are for each other. It's almost an even split between action shots and intimate romance, further suggesting that GTA VI's story will have a Bonnie and Clyde vibe.</p>

<p>Additionally, developer Rockstar has <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">updated its website</a> to include more information and images, including screenshots, new characters, and more. Here's the new synopsis of the game's plot, revealing more of the story's stakes:</p>

<p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is over a year away, giving ravenous fans plenty of time to dissect this new look at the game and mine it for more information. Regardless, we can't wait for May 26 of next year. For more GTA 6, you can <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/04/grand-theft-auto-vi-revealed-with-first-official-trailer-alongside-2025-release">rewatch its reveal trailer</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/humor/2023/12/05/watch-two-florida-men-analyze-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer">see what Game Informer's resident Floridians thought about Rockstar's adaptation of their home state</a>.</p>

            <p>Rockstar has begun lifting the lid on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, releasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-second-trailer-is-here">new trailer today</a> that gives a deeper look at its pair of protagonists and the setting of Leonida.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">game's website</a> has also been updated to show off its cast of characters and locations - Vice City, and beyond.</p>
<p>Judging by its sexy trailer, it looks like GTA 6 is set to be something of a love story, but there's a strong music industry theme too.</p>

<p>First up, our protagonists are Jason Duval and Lucia Caminos. The hunky Jason is a former army soldier turned drug runner, while Lucia is fresh out of Leonida Penitentiary, having previously lived in Liberty City with her family.</p>
<p>Both characters seem to be seeking a way out of their current lives, leading to the events of GTA 6.</p>

</figure>
<p>Next up is Jason's friend Cal Hampton described as living "at the low tide of America and happy there". He appears to be something of a lovable fool.</p>
<p>Cal is also an associate of Brian Heder, a drug runner "from the golden age of smuggling in the Keys" who owns a boat yard with his third wife, Lori. Brian is allowing Jason to live rent-free at one of his properties, as long as he helps out with some jobs. I imagine it's a slippery slope for Jason, setting up his meeting with Lucia.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then there are the music industry characters. Boobie Ike is a local legend of Vice City, owning a recording studio, a strip club, and real estate as part of a grand empire. "The club money pay for the studio, and the drug money pay for it all," he says.</p>
<p>Boobie has partnered with aspiring music mogul Dre'Quan Priest for the Only Raw Records label. Dre'Quan is "more of a hustler than a gangster", though the music industry has always been his goal.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Boobie and Dre'Quan | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Only Raw Records has signed a pair of troublesome female rappers, Bae-Luxe and Roxy aka Real Dimez. They are "girls with the savvy to turn their time shaking down local dealers into cold, hard cash via spicy rap tracks and a relentless social media presence".</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The GTA games have always been recognised for their brilliant soundtracks - shout out to Vice City's classic 80s tracks - but I'm particularly excited to see the developers lampoon the current state of the music industry and its reliance on social media. We already saw elements of that in the first trailer.</p>
<p>The last character introduced is Raul Bautista, a "seasoned bank robber always on the hunt for talent". No guesses for which pair of desperate anti-heroes he's about to hire.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Raul Bautista | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Rockstar has also hinted at some of the locations we'll be exploring in GTA 6.</p>
<p>Vice City - a spoof of Miami - is of course at the core of Leonida, representing the "glamour, hustle, and greed of America captured in a single city". It contains the white sands of Ocean Beach, the "bustling panaderías" of Little Cuba, the "bootleg brands" of the Tisha-Wocka flea market, and the VC Port.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The glamour of Vice City | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Further out are the Leonida Keys, where life "isn't flashy but it's easy" - presumably this is where Jason starts out. Grassrivers are the "untamable jewel of Leonida's crown", known for their gators and other "weirder discoveries".</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The thrills of Leonida Keys | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Port Gellhorn is full of cheap motels and shut-down attractions, presumably a spin on Florida's notorious theme parks and tourist areas. Ambrosia is the "heart of Leonida" where "American industry and old school values still reign supreme" - it includes a sugar refinery offering jobs and a dominating biker gang.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Nighttime in Port Gellhorn | <span>Image credit: <cite>Rockstar</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The final location is Mount Kalaga National Park, a national landmark on the state's northern border full of hunting and fishing spots, off-road trails, and hillbilly mystics.</p>
<p>How big will GTA 6's map end up? We don't know yet, but judging by these locations it's going to be expansive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">GTA 6 was recently delayed</a> from later this year, and will now be released on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This new trailer is the latest look at the game since the previous trailer, released in December 2023. Hopefully it won't be such a long wait for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-giant-bomb-polygon-layoffs-valnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke highly of its early goings on the podcast</a>, and I gave it a thumbs up in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my review</a>, though I’m still wrapping my head around the full RPG spectacle of its final act biting off a bit more than it could chew for my liking.</p><p>While a not-insignificant portion of the internet is embroiled in debates over whether <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s runaway success stems from its refreshing flavor of turn-based RPG mechanics, conveniently overlooking the <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-unique-turn-based-combat-final-fantasy-lost-odyssey-yakuza-dragon-quest-baldurs-gate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stellar lineup of similar RPGs</a> we’ve been spoiled with lately, or gaming’s latest case of recency bias, one thing is indisputable: <a href="https://lnk.to/clair-obscur-expedition-33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its soundtrack slaps</a>. I spoke with composer Lorien Testard about how he went from making tunes once a week on Soundcloud to landing his first game project.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p>This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&nbsp;</p><hr><h2>Getting started</h2><p><strong>Isaiah Colbert:</strong> What was the process like getting approached by director Guillaume Broche to collaborate with Sandfall Interactive on <em>Clair Obscur</em> five years ago?</p><p><strong>Lorien Testard:&nbsp; </strong>Usually, I write one song a week, so it was a really long process for me. After one year [of posting songs], Guillaume found me on a web forum about indie games. He listened to some song off my SoundCloud, and he really liked what he heard, and he loved my music. So he asked me to do the job for <em>Expedition 33</em>.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> What details were you given about the game to help guide your approach to crafting music that complements its narrative and setting?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I was really free. I created what I wanted and what I liked. But we had the same tastes on the video game — the melancholia and the nostalgia we wanted to put into the soundtrack, a sensitivity of sadness and a lifting up [element too].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Is there a particular emotion or atmosphere you strived to convey through the music?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It depends on which la ville (town) you are in. When you are in the Gestral village or just at the start, it’s not the same atmosphere. It was like seeing each part of the game and thinking, “What will be the best fit?” When you were in the <a href="https://youtu.be/Ms4Mmb9kY4E?si=SWwtUt7EkQtd4Hyn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Gublu”</a>, we had a lot of submarine sounds and some crazy ideas for the water and aquatic stuff. But after, in <a href="https://youtu.be/2tl5ekssCZg?si=NOk3FQY_FAmIUSom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Sciel”</a>, for example, we have more beautiful, poetic, dense, soft music to help describe the environment.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> I <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/composing-the-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read</a> that you alternated between your home studio and working with the Curieux <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FIMsKKvBRM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orchestra</a> at the Midilive Studios in Paris while making the game’s soundtrack. Did you use any unique instruments or production techniques that worked best in one setting over the other?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I was working for five years in my own studio, and then we chose a section of tracks and we did a little orchestra session. It’s not like I did a back-and-forth with the orchestra. It was only three days at the end of the project, so [the soundtrack] was really made at my own place. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And, yeah, you have a lot of musical techniques. I love to find my sound on the soundtrack. For example, I really like to layer the piano sound of the game. Sometimes, it's like 12 different pianos to do the sound of one track. I really love this concept of taking the part I like in the virtual instrumental piano and layering it with the other part I like to have a distinct sound for a piano track.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><h2>Finding sound through inspirations&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong>With <em>Clair Obscur</em> being your first contracted game, how did you manage the stress while stepping into the role of sonic leader for the project? Did you face any creative blocks or challenges, and how did you work through them?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Honestly, at the start, we're like, we are three [songs] at the start. Then six. Then 10. So I didn't feel any pressure at all, because it was a thread on Discord, and we did the game and the soundtrack together at the start. And then we hired and grew bigger. From the beginning, I was here to write, so I didn't feel like “It's now my job.” It was a dream project to be with your friends and create music from the start.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Were there specific moments during the process where inspiration struck you?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It's happened often. Every song has a particular story that I really love. So for each song, I can say there’s a story.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>One song that struck me was the “<a href="https://youtu.be/sN91jLQJjcQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirene</a>” theme. It reminded me a lot of the music I’d hear in <em>Nier Automata</em> or <em>Nier Replicant</em>, where it goes into a <a href="https://youtu.be/CqzlvuJs9-4?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballet kind of playfulness</a>. But it’d also have <a href="https://youtu.be/RRCK_Co8c9c?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moodier</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/1KiFMEj7DtQ?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">darker undertones</a> to it with a boss fight that kicked my ass.</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> With “Sirene,” I wrote it early in the project, and I wrote the guitar part. So all is coming from the guitar. The main idea and concept for “Sirene” was the softness of the whole environment and the bosses. Then I added a low recorder to make the wind and environment like a circle.&nbsp;</p><p>In the level, you have the boss right at the start. You see it, and you have to do the whole level to be in front of her. So across the entire level, we wanted this voice that the player can hear everywhere. So we had the voice of Alice [Duport-Percier], the singer of the game, and the three elements together, and we created the track. Guitar first, then the low recorder, and then the voice everywhere in the level.</p><figure><figcaption>Lorien Testard and vocalist Alice Duport-Percier cooking in the recording studio. <span></span><span>Antoine Billet</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC:</strong> How did your approach to composing evolve over the five years you spent working on the game?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I knew pretty early the scope of the universe, the level, and the script, so I made my dream soundtrack. For example, I would take a level and would want to write three environment tracks, two battle themes, and one boss theme. I do that for the whole game and — one by one — I’d write the track for five years until the end.</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> <em>Clair Obscur</em> proudly draws inspiration from iconic RPGs like <em>Lost Odyssey</em> and <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, while adding its unique twist to the genre. What gaming soundtracks from childhood shaped your musical taste, and how did those influences come through in the tracks you created for the game?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I tried not to be influenced by other soundtracks. I was focused on my music for five years. But for sure, I have a lot of soundtracks I love from before. I love the music of Joe Hisaishi from Studio Ghibli. I listened to him often when I was younger. And I love <em>Zelda </em>music. I’m really a fan of <em>Zelda</em>'s sound and universe. So maybe we can feel my past taste in my music now. I also listen to a lot of French songs and French artists, so we can feel it too in the soundtrack.</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Who were some of those French artists?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Bashung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alain Bashung</a>.</p><h2>Picking favorites and getting Ben Starr to sing</h2><p><strong>IC: </strong><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack clocks out at a whopping 8 hours plus, with 154 tracks, some of which are remixes/permutations of a previous theme. Is there any specific piece of music from the game that stands out as a personal favorite, or one you're especially proud of?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's really hard to tell my favorite soundtrack, but I could give a story of the most challenging. I wrote three songs —“<a href="https://youtu.be/-i_nT9d-mK8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à peindre</a>,” “<a href="https://youtu.be/3kMbTzomh94?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à t'aimer</a>,” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/10m7CzhQrFs?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Une vie à rêver</a>”— three eleven-minute tracks that were important for a confrontation in the game. They’re really important songs, and I spent a lot of time writing them with Victor Borba and Duport-Percier. It was challenging to create, and it took me the most time of the whole project.&nbsp;</p><p>When you discover it in-game, the cutscene and all the transition between the songs happens. It creates so much emotion to feel that. I have seen some reactions of players when they discover that’s in-game. It's insane to see that it works so well, because you have silence, and then you have something that happens, and the track is coming, and it's so powerful. I really love it.</p><p>And “<a href="https://youtu.be/EWEK2-6whZI?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aux Lendemains non Ecrits</a>,” the one before the end. It’s a favorite song of my father. I shared the eight hour soundtrack with my father. He listened to every song and said to me, “I really love the lyrics of this song,” and I think about it too. I’m proud of this lyric. It’s authentic and really simple. But for me, it worked well for where the song is put. In English, it’s “To Unwritten Tomorrows” and the song plays at a special place.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Sandfall Interactive</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>IC: </strong>Even with my limited understanding of music, I noticed that <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s soundtrack features a leitmotif — a catchy “Dim dim dam dada” melody — in Lumière’s theme, performed by vocalist Duport-Percier. Where did the inspiration for this earworm of a tune come from?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqizXvvWnmM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lumière</a>” was one of the first tracks I wrote for the project. I wrote it on the guitar first and I really love the leitmotif of the song, because we had an internal playtest of the game, and we had a first draft of Lumière and Gustave walking on the roof of the city, and we put the credits of everyone who worked on the game. When I saw it, I knew it was the perfect atmosphere for “Lumière.” When I found that I really liked it, I decided to [use it] for the whole part of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we have the melody in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztbPkvqRiGg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gustave</a>” because it’s his city, it's like his own city, and he cares about those who came before and those who come after. So, we find this motif in his team, and we find it often in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>When you come back to Lumière, it's not the same. So the song could not be the same after what happened. But in the camp, we have some variation to remember where they came from and where they must go. You always have the Paintress in front of you, so the melody is really powerful to give this feeling of “My home is at my back and I have to think of it and protect it, but I have to move toward the adventure in front of me.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC:</strong> Are there other recurring themes or motifs within <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s music that carry deeper, symbolic significance?</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> The main motif of the game is “Alicia.”We find this melodic motif in a lot of songs. I think “Alicia” is the most used theme in battle, and then we have “Lumière.” For example, when you had the music of the Gommage, it plays. It’s the music of Sophie when she turns to dust. And I use it for another place in the game, but it’s become the theme of Sophie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Lorien Testard, Alice Duport-Percier - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 - Alicia (Orchestral)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNu5UvsRNI8?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>As is tradition in RPGs, each party member in <em>Clair Obscur</em> has their unique musical theme. How would you describe these character themes, and what approach did you take to give each one its own distinct sonic identity?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>It's so funny to do that. Honestly, I see that like a gift. I've played so many games, so I know when you write a theme for a character, it's for the life of a character. So it's really important that I give all my love to do that. I spent a lot of time looking at the concept art and trying to feel the mood and the whole soul of the characters.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, “Gustave” was written really late in the production. We can think [of it as] one of the first songs, but “Gustave” was written six months ago. It's late because, at first, I thought “Lumière” would be the “Gustave” theme. But one day, I found Gustave's piano melody, and I knew it was his, so we put it in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IC: </strong>How about Maelle’s theme?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>Maelle’s theme was special. It's the last theme on the soundtrack, and I put it in last for a good reason. You understand why, but seeing the song take life was special because it's the last song we recorded with the orchestra. We filmed the session with a dancer, and when I saw the dance with the whole song we recorded with a beautiful voice in French and the full orchestra, I knew it was like my farewell to Maelle. It was emotional for me to see it end. I could not have ended up happier with Alice and Victor’s help.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Until Next Life" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>IC: </strong>We’ve talked about collaborating with incredible vocalists like <em>Devil May Cry 5</em>’s Borba and mezzo-soprano Axelle Verner, but the score also saw gaming’s babygirl, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Starr</a>, join in too. I’ve <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/expedition-33-composer-music-ben-starr-verso-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heard </a>Ben’s involvement might have come after a couple of beers, prompting him to lend his vocal talents to Verso and its soundtrack. Would you mind recounting how Starr’s musical debut came to be?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LT:</strong> It was a chaotic good proposition at Christmas. I wrote the song “<a href="https://youtu.be/a9P0Qgi4wAM?list=OLAK5uy_lJbuSXw4Bfo2tDlP6s_CNznTfYGe0GEBM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Next Life</a>” a year before meeting Ben Starr. The song is about Verso and what happened in his life. I told Broche it would be cool to have Verso’s voice actor singing it. We forgot about it, and then, one Christmas, I met Starr, and we shared a clip of the orchestration to show what we did. I remember saying, “Yeah, let’s go. I really want to do ‘Until Next Life’ with you. Would you like to try to sing?” He said yes, and the next morning, we recorded together. It was impressive to see him have a good instinct on the song, so we can have it feel really deep with the voices of Verso, and it works well in contrast with Alice, who is singing like an angel.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>IC: </strong>Do you have any advice for aspiring composers looking to create music for video games?</p><p><strong>LT: </strong>I will advise them to play like [they’re] a composer. For example, I thought, “What does a composer do?” Every day, a composer writes music. So I wrote music every day for video games. After playing [music] for a long time, you become a composer.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bob-barker-mic-gameshow-sony-ecm-51-match-game"><h3>Bring Back Those Long-Ass Game Show Mics</h3></a><p>The long microphone used Bob Barker on the Price is Right and Gene Rayburn on Match Game haven't been produced in years.

The new trailer is — like the first — pretty heavily focused on setting up the characters and world, without much in the way of gameplay (though the developer does call it “the biggest, most immersive evolution of the series yet”).</p><p>But we do have a few more details about the story.

		<p>Given that the game has recently been delayed no one was expecting <del>the Spanish Inquisition</del> a second official Grand Theft Auto VI trailer, but here it is!</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for another crime story. The announcement trailer introduced us to Lucia, the series’ first female protagonist, and an unnamed male counterpart. Lucia seemingly starts off the game getting out of prison after a bit of “bad luck”.</p>
<p>The new trailer names that male counterpart, he’s called Jason, and seems to be working as a handyman. After that its exactly what you would expect from a GTA game: Car chases, gun fights, boats, planes, and a bit of sexy stuff on the side. It’s all sound tracked by the brilliant “Hot Together” by the Pointer Sisters, a nod to the relationship between Jason and Lucia.</p>
<p>Rockstar has announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>

<p>The statement on <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026">the Rockstar site</a> reads:</p>
<p>:Grand Theft Auto VI is now set to release on May 26, 2026. We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank<br>
you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game.</p>
<p>With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and<br>
deserve.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing more information with you soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Rockstar Games</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games has just dropped the second Grand Theft Auto VI trailer. This one is heavily centered on Jason Duval, whereas the <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first trailer from December 2023</a> was arguably focused more on Lucia Caminos. We see her again, too, and it's clear the two are very much meant to be GTA's version of Bonnie and Clyde - two robbers very much in love. As for the rest, it's classic GTA to its finest - car chases, explosions, and larger-than-life characters briefly introduced to the fans.</p>
<p>The brief YouTube description of the video says:</p>
<p><em>Vice City, USA.</em></p>
<p><em>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</em></p>

<p>Rockstar Games has also launched the <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Grand Theft Auto VI website</a>, which has already crashed due to excessive load. Thankfully, the developer also sent the press a copy of the first details on the game's characters and locations, as well as a boatload of new images.</p>

<p><em>Jason wants an easy life, but things just keep getting harder. </em><em>Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new. Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out, but right now, it's hard to tell.</em></p>
<p><em>Lucia’s father taught her to fight as soon as she could walk. Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. Sheer luck got her out. Lucia’s learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.</em></p>
<p><em>More than anything, Lucia wants the good life her mom has dreamed of since their days in Liberty City — but instead of half-baked fantasies, Lucia is prepared to take matters into her own hands. A life with Jason could be her way out. Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia’s committed to her plan — no matter what it takes.</em></p>

<p>Vice City is described as offering something different in each neighborhood: Ocean Beach, Little Cuba, Tisha-Wocka, and VC Port. There's also the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the 'primordial expanse' of the Grassrivers, the forgotten coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and the wild country of Mount Kalaga.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the game was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to May 26, 2026. We still have a year and 20 days of wait left.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/second-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released a second&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer just a few days after announcing that the game would, in fact, no longer make its intended release window of fall 2025.</p>

<p>Last week, Rockstar announced that&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>will be launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow">on May 26th next year</a>, acknowledging that the date is "later than [fans] expected" but reaffirming its desire to "try and exceed [players'] expectations" with the game.</p>

<p>Now, the developer has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer in which we get a closer look at the lives of protagonists Jason and Lucia, although the trailer still doesn't contain any actual "on-the-ground" gameplay, so to speak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=jbwGECVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-2-lucia-jason.jpg?itok=lZTJt_Bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>trailer is here, but it doesn't say much about the game's gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we're reacquainted with our two main characters, both of whom were first introduced as part of the original&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em><em>VI&nbsp;</em>trailer all the way back in December 2023 (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025" rel="nofollow">yes, it really has been that long</a>).</p>

<p>At the outset of the trailer, we see Lucia getting out of prison, with Jason at the gates to greet her. What follows is a fairly typical montage of&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-style debauchery, with heists, partying, and over-the-top action setpieces all playing out against a backdrop of 80s music.</p>

<p>Over the course of the trailer, we hear Zenglen's "Child Support", Wang Chung's "Everybody Have Fun Tonight", Tammy Wynette's "Talkin' to Myself Again", and the Pointer Sisters' "Hot Together", all of which will presumably be on&nbsp;<em>GTA VI</em>'s soundtrack alongside Tom Petty's "Love Is a Long Road" from the debut trailer.</p>




<p>We also get to meet a number of the characters who will populate&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>'s fictional state of Leonida, and it looks like everyone's favorite gun-toting maniac Phil Cassidy will be making a return from his&nbsp;<em>GTA: Vice City&nbsp;</em>glory days, too.</p>

<p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI&nbsp;</em>launches for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26th, 2026. You can find lots more info about the game, including details about its characters and story, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the official website</a>.</p>

And oh wow, this game looks incredible.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195922,196345" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Footage of the game has been incredibly slim, Rockstar aware that the <em>GTA</em> series delivers its own publicity whether it’s seen or not. Simply not showing footage gets the entire industry talking. So, it’s something of a (fantastic) surprise that a brand new trailer should appear in the wake of the game’s delay into next year.</p><p>Originally intended to release this fall, with multiple games changing their launch plans to try to avoid it, Rockstar said the game needs another six months development time to be up to the standard it wants. Hence, the new release date of May 26, 2026.</p><p>Those who were disappointed, or even worried about the state of the game, should have their mind put slightly at ease by the new trailer. It’s definitively a <em>GTA </em>game, with no big surprises or twists, but rather a bunch of Miami-like vibes and a lot of butts.</p><p>The return to Vice City looks stunning, although it’s not entirely clear from the trailer what’s in-game and what’s cutscene, albeit that it’ll all be made in the same engine.</p><p>The official description for the new trailer reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them. But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida—forced to rely on each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.</p></blockquote><p>Don’t expect to see any more of the game for a good long while now. Rockstar will likely go back into its bunker and get on with completing the game, not worrying itself about producing any more ads. The game’s going to sell a billionty-million copies either way, if only it gets finished.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That good games, whether they come from Microsoft or otherwise, top the sales charts. That’s perhaps no surprise. It’s also no surprise to see these games do well on PlayStation. The PS5 was screaming out for a game like Playground’s wonderful racer, Forza Horizon 5, so its April launch on the console was hotly anticipated. Then there’s The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which is scratching that Bethesda itch across PC and console, and the eternally popular Minecraft, even more popular now with the Minecraft movie going viral and breaking records.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is now the new normal for Microsoft, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-coming-in-summer-even-on-playstation">just announced Gears of War: Reloaded</a> for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation coming in August. It seems inevitable that Halo, what was once the flagship Xbox exclusive, will also make the jump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-gaming-boss-phil-spencer-wont-rule-out-any-xbox-exclusive-making-the-jump-to-playstation-including-halo"><u>Microsoft’s gaming chief Phil Spencer said there were no “red lines” in its first-party lineup when it comes to going multiplatform</u></a> — and that included Halo.

Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><div id="xbox-games-series-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3><h3>Xbox Games Series Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>As former Xbox executive Peter Moore told IGN last year</u></a>, bringing Halo to PlayStation will have been a topic of discussion at Microsoft for some time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, if Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's had its ups and downs, but look, Xbox wouldn't be what Xbox is without Halo. But yeah, I'm sure those conversations are happening. Whether they come to fruition, who knows? But they're definitely happening, I'm sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft does face a potential backlash from hardcore Xbox fans who are already disgruntled after what they feel is a devaluing of the Xbox as a console, the lack of exclusives, and Microsoft’s marketing strategy for its gaming business. Losing Halo to PlayStation could spark yet another angry response, but Moore told IGN that won’t deter Microsoft from doing what’s right for its business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The question would be, ultimately, is that reaction enough not to make a fundamental business decision for the future of not only Microsoft’s business, but gaming in itself?” Moore said. “Those hardcore are getting smaller in size and older in age. You've got to cater to the generations that are coming through, because they're going to drive the business over the next 10, 20 years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all.

To know this game, it’s useful to know how <em>Ether One</em>, <em>The Occupation</em>, and <em>Dahlia View</em> were brought to life.</p><p><em>Ether One</em> (2014) was an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,254 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> through the brain exploring what it’s like to live with dementia and the fragility of our core memories. The experience was deeply meaningful to us and taught us that we don’t need to be explicit with story. Instead, respect player input and they’ll place the pieces in order. In <em>The Occupation</em> (2019), the emergence of headlines, and not knowing what was true, whilst also being constrained by the ticking clock, forced the player to make choices about paths they were uncertain about. <em>Dahlia View</em> (2021) brought us a tragedy of how a missing child can impact a community of people and how to weave incredible characters into a thrilling experience. </p><p>The Ripper will create horrific circumstances forcing you to choose a path. The path will have consequences for someone, you just don’t know who. You have to figure out where your moral judgments lay. Power is all around us and how power is used relates to the scenario you’re placed in. </p><p>The thriller genre is underserved. We have media on TV, in movies, documentaries and podcasts, but we have few game examples. We want <em>I AM RIPPER</em> to cater to all those people who love gritty thrillers, but don’t have an interactive way of exploring the themes, situations and challenges in a non-linear way. </p><p><em>I AM RIPPER</em> builds upon everything we’ve learnt about story delivery, tactile gameplay and meaningful consequence. It’s not a puzzle game, or a horror game, or a detective game, but it has all the key components of those genres to create something that feels rewarding, explorative of core themes and characters that feel real and grounded in their world.</p><p>We hope you resonate with our work and we’d love to chat to you more about our game if you have questions.</p><p>Thank you for your time,<br>White Paper Games</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
