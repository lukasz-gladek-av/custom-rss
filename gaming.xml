<p>We've had a little go, and typing in either of the main stars (of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">ever-so-slightly delayed film</a>) will get you a little emoji and message, with a "well, excuse me princess!" accompanied by a cute little elf emoji for Bo, and Benjamin earning a quite amusing "KYAAAA!

<p>Of course, as experts on everything Nintendo, you'll all be well aware that these quotes are references to the Legend of Zelda cartoon series, and a nod to the exasperated sounds that Link likes to make when he does anything more strenuous than cook a bird leg. Honestly, how's this guy saving worlds when he's having to roar like that swinging an axe?</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda movie is due to hit cinemas on the 7th May, 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has confirmed that Battlefield 6 will receive its reveal trailer on Thursday, July 24 at 8 AM Pacific Time/11 AM Eastern Time/5 PM Central European Time. The trailer's official tagline is:</p>



<p><em>Prepare for the ultimate all-out warfare experience in Battlefield 6.</em></p>



<p>A few days ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-rumored-unveil-3-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got word</a> from insiders and content creators that a reveal event was on the way. Yesterday, some enterprising users <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> that DICE and EA are preparing an Open Beta to go live in early August, providing players with the first public hands-on experience with Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Granted, a few lucky Battlefield Labs testers already got their hands on the game in the past few months. Several videos even <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked out</a>, showing promising content and features for the next iteration in the military shooter IP.</p>



<p>Back in April, the development teams (of which there are four dedicated to Battlefield 6: DICE, Motive, Criterion, and Ripple Effect Studios) <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> about the renewed importance of destructibility in the game, which will allow players to shape the environment to their needs to gain a tactical advantage. Furthermore, rubble will stay on the map, potentially becoming useful for cover and protection.</p>



<p>Unlike its predecessor, Battlefield 6 will also include a full-fledged single-player campaign. Motive Studios is handling this story, which will be thematically <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inspired</a> by movies like Civil War and TV shows like Lioness.</p>



<p>The hype for this reveal is certainly enormous among fans, especially after the disappointing Battlefield 2042. Publisher Electronic Arts also has massive expectations, with rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointing</a> to a $400 million budget that EA hopes will be recouped and more with a target 100 million player base.</p>



<p>EA previously said the game would launch within this fiscal year, but if there really is an Open Beta coming in the next couple of weeks, the release date may be relatively soon. Stay tuned on Wccftech to get all the official Battlefield 6 details on July 24.</p>

And on top of a new trailer for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675508/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-nintendo-switch-2">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></em>, there’s a new Switch 2 bundle featuring the game, too.</p><p>The — and you’re going to want to sit down for this, since the name is apocalyptically long — Nintendo Switch 2 + <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition bundle will be available on October 16th for $499.

            <p>You need to buck your ideas up and start doing better. No, it's not what your parents say whenever you tell them what you're up to for a living, it's what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead are basically telling players with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s latest major order.</p>
<p>Get out there with those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-lets-you-impale-baddies-with-flags-as-the-bots-take-aim-at-the-democracy-space-station">stabby flags</a> and murder-death millions of the enemies Super Earth's citizens are most afraid of, in order to restore their faith in your ability to protect them by murder-deathing things. It's not all tough love, though. There's also another free cape for folks who helped solve a puzzle in May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The relentless assault on Managed Democracy is taking its toll on our citizens' sense of well-being," reads the fresh order that just gone live in the game, "Surveys indicate that citizens fears of invasion, disenfranchisement, and dismemberment of loved ones is at an all-time high." I mean, given the divers' efforts to defend the Democracy Space Station from the Automatons in the previous mission ended in defeat, you can see how we got to this sad state of affairs.</p>
<p>So, Super Earth's bigwigs have ordered the creation of three new "Maximum Security Cities" dubbed Fort Union, Fort Sanctuary, and Emeria. The names aren't quite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">as catchy as gun</a>, but you can't have everything, I suppose. That's clearly not enough thinly veiled and chuckle-worthy satire, though, so this latest order tasks folks with killing millions of the enemies that "arise most frequently in citizen nightmares", as part of a galaxy-brain PR campaign.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>MAJOR ORDER: The relentless assault on Managed Democracy is taking its toll on our citizens' sense of well-being. The images of our cities in flames, and butchery of innocent citizens, broadcast on all news channels, are impossible to forget.</p><p>Surveys indicate that citizens fears… <a href="https://t.co/aYDL1hulHD">pic.twitter.com/aYDL1hulHD</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1947647862386348170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Break out the Big Smoke memes, because the order calls for 20 million Shriekers, 12.5 million Impalers, 6.25 million Factory Striders, 7.5 million Fleshmobs, and 3.75 million Leviathans to be splattered across space. It's a big mix of bugs, bots, and Illuminate squids to murder-death, so even a player base that's notoriously efficient at racking up big kill numbers might struggle.</p>
<p>Lucky then that Arrowhead gifted another free cape to players this morning. Rather than commemorating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/417-days-on-from-helldivers-2s-big-psn-backlash-players-have-finally-gotten-their-review-bomb-cape">some review bombing</a>, this one's dubbed the Ingress-81 cape and is a reward for folks who took part in the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-next-big-galactic-war-twist-looks-kicking-off-with-huge-station-81-tease-livestream">Station-81 alternate reality game</a> Arrowhead ran via Helldivers 2's Discord back in May. Basically, it was a tease that helped tee up the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-update-promises-victory-for-squidkind-as-the-illuminate-finally-invade-hated-super-earth">Illuminate invasion of Super Earth</a> later that month.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Attention, Helldivers!</p><p>We are beginning the distribution of the Ingress-81 cape to recognize those who bravely worked together many long hours to bring Station-81 back online in May.   </p><p>As always, please allow some time for the item to appear in your game and join our Discord… <a href="https://t.co/x9PNuSbpg8">pic.twitter.com/x9PNuSbpg8</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1947583094900363368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

Forget “could have been an email,” this Presents could have been a text message. “We’re adding a few new Pokémon to old games, and there’s a generic-looking puzzle game for kids.” That was the sum total of new information delivered, unless the information you’d been craving about this October’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> were the first names of about three characters.</p><p>Things didn’t start out well, with a bizarrely amateurish video promoting this year’s Pokémon World Championships, accompanied by what looked like camcorder footage of 2024's finals and a guy mumbling about how he hoped we’d come along. Traditionally, Nintendo and Pokémon like to open these videos with <em>something</em>, a fun tease or a cute reveal. But given the entire thing didn’t have a single piece of <em>something</em> to offer, it couldn’t appear there either.</p><p>There was a brief moment of happiness where we got to see a bunch of clips from the adorable stop-motion Netflix show&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, which has new episodes coming on September 4, before jumping over to UK stop-motion studio Aardman (they behind <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>) who have a new show with the astonishing name&nbsp;<em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu</em>. A brief clip was shown that absolutely did not deliver.</p><figure id="" data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-recommend-id="image://819dd88d89d7d37a5875f13894e7d736" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1074" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some crappy plastic figures on a tabletop." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But this was all as nothing compared to the cheek-chewingly awkward section on PokéPark Kanto, an as-yet unbuilt new section of some Japanese theme park that’s going to be Pokémon-themed. This included the excruciating moment in which Junichi Masuda,&nbsp;chief creative fellow of The Pokémon Company, told us how this would be a place “where Pokémon truly exist” accompanied by—I kid you not—shots of tiny plastic Pokémon on crappy little models, and then, somehow worse, plastic figures just plonked down in some random woodland. Oh my god. Also, I cannot get over how Masuda was shown looking ever-further away from the camera every time he appeared.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-recommend-id="image://8d0727825b0d833ec0b60449ff5f9a71" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man looks ever-further away from a camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It was then time to move on to a montage of old games receiving new Pokémon, which would usually appear after a couple of nice surprises, rather than someone putting some plastic figures on a table top and saying it’s a theme park. But then it was time for THE BIG NEW POKEMON GAME REVEAL!</p><p><em> Pokémon Friends</em> is...a generic-looking puzzle game, the sort that’s usually dressed up as “improve your brain” nonsense, just a bunch of sliding tiles and sokoban games. And I swear to you, this genuinely was the only new reveal for the entire Presents.</p><p>Rather than in any way acknowledging that there’s no new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, instead we were told about yet more nothingness for the three-year-old <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> games, a chance to get shiny versions of a couple of monsters in raids, and voiceover informing us that it runs better on Switch 2. We also got another quick glimpse at the turn-based strategy game<em> Pokémon Champions</em>, announced back in February, but not due until some point in 2026. And then it was the big event: a bunch of things we already knew about <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A. </em>Beyond the names of a couple of characters, the only actually new piece of information was that there was to be a Mega Dragonite. And <em>oh dear god</em> it’s some unholy monstrosity that should have been put down at birth.</p><figure id="" data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-recommend-id="image://fa4ea827a66c2d64deb4c98f1c2f5a65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="751" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mega Dragonite" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And then it was done. A two-month pre-announced event that felt like it had been thrown together by a kid who realized their project deadline was tomorrow. Just the most “Uh, shit, what have we got in the office we can use?” energy.</p><p>Surely there’s <em>something</em> they’ve held back about <em>Z-A</em> that we don’t know yet, some twist or innovative concept they could have mentioned? And who gave clearance on dedicating a full two minutes to a theme park that’s presumably currently a building site, doesn’t open until next year, and isn’t relevant to 95 percent of people watching? There wasn’t even a 3D CAD model of the thing to look at! I wish I could have been there to watch the team of people who had to lug some fiberglass Pokémon out to the nearest woods and film them, presumably all just looking at one another in bemusement over why they’d been asked to do this deeply mad thing.</p><p>I want to be generous and think that back in May, The Pokémon Company had convinced itself that it would be ready by now to make some early reveal of Gen X and next year’s new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game. Maybe the folks there thought they’d have a 10th-generation monster they could show us, or even just some elusive trailer revealing the new region. Sure, it’d be early, given the game likely won’t be out before October 2026, but it’d make some sense of why they’d bothered to organize the Presents in the first place.</p><p>Because what we got instead was the video streaming equivalent of a sweating executive saying, “Er, the reason I brought you all here today is...” and then pointing out the window and faking a heart attack.</p><p>It does make me worry about Pokémon overall. Missing the big game this year might have made sense, given how clearly overworked Game Freak were three years ago when <em>Legends</em> was a spring release, and <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>came out in the fall. But you’d imagine they’d want to let us know big things were coming? And where were the awesome new oddities? <em>Pokémon Friends</em> ain’t it. Instead, it all felt like just sticking a couple of new monsters in a handful of old games, and hoping they’d get away with describing old information about <em>Z-A</em> as “news.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-z-a-unite-champions-netflix-1851786687]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Supermassive Games has delayed its next game, Directive 8020, following a round of layoffs affecting up to 36 employees.</p>
<p>The British studio announced the decision in a social media statement, blaming the layoffs on its need to "adapt our team structure to better align with recent industry changes".</p>
<p>As a result, the studio's forthcoming sci-fi horror game Directive 8020 has been delayed into the first half of 2026.</p>

<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone," the statement reads. "Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected.</p>
<p>"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p>
<p>In addition, the studio confirmed there has been no impact on the development of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-gets-october-release-date-and-theres-an-enhanced-edition-of-the-original-on-the-way">due for release in October</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassives-dark-pictures-series-returns-in-2025-with-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020">Directive 8020 will be a continuation of the studio's Dark Pictures series</a>, which started with Man of Medan, followed by Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me. It stars James Bond and Marvel actress Lashana Lynch in the lead role of "ground-breaking astronaut" Young and is set to release across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Tom Phillips <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/directive-8020-is-a-notable-upgrade-to-the-dark-pictures-anthologys-formula">saw the game in action at last year's Gamescom</a>, calling it a "notable upgrade to the Dark Pictures Anthology's formula".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

<p>The park is split into two — a town area, and a forest area.

			<p>Despite the lack of an announcement, the rumored Starfield Playstation 5 port is reportedly still happening, but it could take a while longer to launch.</p>



<p>Replying to a follower's question on X regarding the long-rumored port of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda, known insider NateTheHate stated that the port is still happening, but the release may have been slightly delayed than originally planned. The insider added that a proper update on the matter will be provided when possible.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Starfield PlayStation 5 port releasing later than initially planned, while disappointing for those who are waiting to experience Bethesda's latest big role-playing game, is not exactly surprising, as it isn't the only project related to the game that will take longer to release. <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-second-expansion-unlikely-2025/">A few days ago</a>, NateTheHate revealed that a second DLC is in the works, but it's unlikely to be released this year. If this DLC ends up being more substantial than the Shattered Space DLC, bringing new features that could improve the base game's experience as well, it wouldn't be surprising for Bethesda to launch the port alongside the new expansion, which could be called <a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/">Starborn</a>.</p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive Games, the studio responsible for the likes of Bandai Namco's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>anthology series, has announced another round of layoffs.</p>

<p>Last year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off a number of employees</a> as part of a "reorganization" effort; the number wasn't revealed, but Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that around 90 Supermassive staffers were affected.</p>

<p>Now, in a <a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Supermassive says it's laying off "up to 36" employees as part of a new "redundancy consultation process". The studio cites the "challenging and ever-evolving environment" of the gaming industry as the reason for these newest cuts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=V1-arE7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/supermassive-games-layoffs-2025-man-of-medan.jpg?itok=fhZFXXN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Dark Pictures&nbsp;</em>developer Supermassive Games is going through another round of layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>As part of this layoff wave, Supermassive also says that its upcoming "cinematic sci-fi horror adventure"&nbsp;<em>Directive 8020&nbsp;</em>will be delayed until the first half of 2026. You can read our very own Andrew's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/directive-8020-enhances-gameplay-putting-stealth-and-scares-in-players-hands" rel="nofollow">preview of that game here</a> to find out what he thought of it.</p>

<p>If you're worried about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares III</em>, you needn't be; Supermassive says that these layoffs will have "no impact on the development" of the upcoming horror puzzle-platformer, and the October 10th release date, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced last month</a>, will go ahead as planned.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Supermassive isn't even the only studio to lay off staff in the last week or so; it joins&nbsp;<em>GreedFall II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Steelrising&nbsp;</em>developer Spiders, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs across its animation and rig team</a> this week.</p>

<p>These layoffs are also part of a broader pattern that has seen thousands of industry employees losing their jobs over the last couple of years, as well as project cancellations and studio closures galore.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see how else Supermassive Games' latest layoffs affect the studio's operations. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
EA and DICE have decided to let players choose between locking weapons to classes in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, or being able to equip any weapon to any class. It might sound like a throwaway technicality, next to the existential terror of reports that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">EA want the new shooter to find a following of 100 million players</a>. In practice, the decision to give players the option of locking weapons to classes is Serious Business. it's the latest manifestation of a debate that goes back to Battlefield's formative squabbles with rival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> Call Of Duty in the noughties.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
First, the what, when and how. Battlefield 6 is currently in beta via the Battlefield Labs program, a program that is in theory clandestine but in practice, has proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam%22%22">leekier than a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup</a>. Oh sorry, that's me reminiscing about lunch. I mean: leakier than a colander that has been used as a helmet... possibly after being used to make a delicious bowl of nourishing vegetable soup - we can't confirm at the time of reporting. 
</p>
<p>
Among other things, we've been treated to sneaky early glimpses of the game's classes: recon, assault, engineer and support. The restoration of something like Battlefield's old class system is welcome tidings indeed for those who hated <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">Battlefield 2042's Specialists</a> - a group of wonky named characters equipped with customisable loadouts, plus a unique speciality and trait. 
</p>
<p>
However, EA spiked the enthusiasm some by revealing that while each Battlefield 6 class will have a "signature weapon" that gives them specific bonuses, any class can use any weapon. This being a bid "to have the interconnected systems and fundamentals of each class shape their role, while granting the freedom to customize how to execute that role," as detailed on <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1943692970106269912">MechaHitler.com</a>. 
</p>
<p>
EA's reasoning has bred a backlash, with players complaining that this is just the old Specialist system wearing a different shade of khaki - and now, EA have relented. "Open Weapons vs Closed Weapons," declares a new post on the <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1947310614411616383">Muskvine</a>. "Why not both? Starting at Open Beta players can choose official playlists with Signature Weapons locked to class, or not. More to come."
</p>
<p>
So, what makes this more than a patch note? Well, Battlefield has always sort of been celebrated as the shooter in which classes play you.  This isn't Call Of Duty, a game in thrall to the individual killing spree, but a sim that thrives on large-scale teamwork and apocalyptic attrition.</p>
<p>That said, the teamwork focus has arguably hindered Battlefield's efforts to expand beyond the PC jarheads who fuelled its initial success, and earn the affections of casual players who just want to peacock and drop an airstrike or two. It makes the game less approachable and immediately gratifying, more reliant on people having trustworthy mates. Hence, DICE's efforts to soften the focus with more customisation options, such as the Specialist system.</p>
<p>
I don't doubt DICE feel a lot of pressure to let players customise as they please in Battlefield 6. I imagine they will be very nervy about introducing anything that constrains a newcomer's choices in a game that - if rumour breath true - has cost over $400 million, and wants to amass a playerbase equivalent to the population of Vietnam. I guess giving people a choice of playlists is the best way forward. We'll hopefully be able to bring you some hands-on impressions soon - the game is due to be formally unveiled on Thursday 24th July.

On mobile devices, the game is free-to-play with microtransactions. Which isn’t great, but it’s hardly unexpected from a mobile game meant to make you check in with daily puzzles and challenges (and maybe spend a buck or two). Where things get weird, however, is that the Switch version is a $10 purchase, but still has all the microtransaction elements intact.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Basic Pack”</a></span> on Nintendo’s console includes “30 puzzles, 70 craftable plush, and all 11 yarn types.” On top of this, there are two “Puzzle On!” packs that cost $15 each, or you can buy them together for $26.

The intended trade-off here seems to be that you can play <em>Pokémon Friends</em> on your Switch without ever being hit with a puzzle limit, but you lose the chance to try the game out to see if you even like the thing, as you can do on your phone. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p><em>Pokémon Friends </em>was one of the only real reveals during today’s Pokémon Presents showcase, but there was plenty of other news about the company’s already-known mobile games, a new look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a breakdown of the story and characters of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-friends-switch-price-free-microtransactions-1851786692]]></content:encoded>

<p>Today's Pokémon Presents began with a quick look at what to expect during the 2025 Pokémon World Championships happening next month in Anaheim, California, including details about where it will be streaming and more.

<p>Ahead of the release of Pokémon Concierge Season 2 (or at least, the next batch of episodes), The Pokémon Company and Netflix released a new look, and you can check it out in the trailer below. There's plenty of new Pokémon, like Sealeo, characters, like Haru's ex-boyfriend, and of course, lots of gorgeous animation. This new batch of Pokémon Concierge episodes hits Netflix on September 4.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzL8NUUgwdc?rel=0&amp;controls=0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzL8NUUgwdc?rel=0&amp;controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><h3>Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu</h3>

<p>Not only did we get our first look at what <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit </em>studio Aardman Animations is cooking up with its upcoming Pokémon series, we also got the official title for the show: Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd &amp; Pichu.

<p>We knew PokéPark Kanto, a Pokémon theme park of sorts, was coming to Japan sometime in the future. Now, we know it will be stretched across 26,000 square meters of Tokyo's verdant Tama Hills, tucked into a corner of Yomiuriland. It is the first-ever permanent outdoor Pokémon attraction, and will hold its grand opening next year. Advance ticket sales are expected to begin later this year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Riot Games has revealed the eighth character for its upcoming 2v2 fighting game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a>. Vi is punching through to the roster, and will be playable by the public at the Evo fighting game event early next month.</p>
<p>A closed beta for 2XKO has also been announced, starting on the 9th September. All players who have been granted access to previous Alpha Lab tests will automatically be thrown into this closed beta. Not only that, but this closed beta will roll into the games' full release.</p>
<p>With Vi's addition, 2XKO will have eight characters in total. She'll first be playable at Evo, the massive fighting game event taking place early next month. After that, you'll need to get into that closed beta to try her out, or wait until launch.</p>

<figcaption>Watch the new Vi gameplay trailer here!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quGZjIkigu4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>This reveal also comes with a gameplay trailer for Vi, showing her off in-action. She's looking like an ultra-aggressive brawler with the ability to carry enemies across the screen with relative ease, and pick 'em up off the ground for extended combos. A pure rushdown character!
</p>
<p>As for when the launch will actually be? Well, the game is still aiming for a 2025 release date as far as we know. We also know the team is targeting a 10 champion launch roster. This means, assuming plans are the same, that between today and December, we're still due two more champions reveals.</p>
<p>Vi obviously is a popular champion. Since the release of Arcane and that series' sheer popularity, both Vi and Jinx have proven fan-favourites among the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> community. Vi is also a character early 2XKO fans have speculated about for a while, given her fist-fighting style and her presence on some wall art at the 2XKO development office.</p>
<p>Are you happy with the Vi pick? Let us know down below, as well as who else you'd like to see make their way to 2XKO!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/heads-up-arcane-fans-vi-has-been-revealed-as-2xkos-eighth-fighter-ahead-of-its-final-beta-landing-in-september]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Supermassive’s space horror adventure, and the next game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> has been delayed to early 2026 from a planned October launch.</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, the studio writes:</p>


<p><em>We’ve made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. </em></p>
<p><em>The reaction to the game so far has been incredible, and we believe that taking a bit more time will help us deliver the very best experience for you all. Everyone at Supermassive is deeply grateful for your patience and ongoing support. </em></p>
<p><em>We can’t wait for you to board the Cassiopeia.</em></p>

<p>It’s a shame that the game will miss its target release, especially when October is the traditional launch window for all sorts of scary games, looking to make the most of the Halloween spooky season. At the same time, the old saying “A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad” is still relatively wise, even if it’s always been misattributed to Shigeru Miyamoto, and we now live in an age where games can be patched and made good with enough extra time and effort.</p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in The Dark Pictures series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship.</p>
<p>The team is using Unreal Engine 5 for the first time, and really looking to push the cinematic scope of the story that they’re telling. Compared to earlier games under the Dark Pictures banner, there’s full third person character control, instead of fixed camera angles – something Supermassive already did away with in later games – but Directive 8020 is pushing further toward action game territory with its take on sci-fi horror.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing more and hope that the rest of development goes smoothly.</p>

<p>Just a little longer now...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Whilst we already knew that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_champions">Pokémon Champions</a>, an upcoming battle-focused game for Switch and mobile platforms, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/pokemon-champions-a-new-battle-focused-game-announced-for-switch-and-mobile">was a thing that is happening</a>, extra details have been fairly thin on the ground this far, including when we'll actually get our hands on the game.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a brand new gameplay trailer which was just shown during the latest Pokémon Presents, we have some more info to dig into, most important of which, perhaps, is that the game won't arrive until <strong>2026</strong>. There's no further info on exactly when we can expect a drop, but this is a little longer than we'd expected, given that we've known about the new entry for a little while now.</p>
<p>Outside of a narrowing down of the release window, we also learned a few more positive things about the game itself, including its compatibility with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> - allowing you to transfer your collection of critters from other games into Champions.</p>
<p>You'll be able to fight in Ranked, Casual, or Private Battles and recruit Pokémon to your team using Victory Points.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for yourself above, it's certainly looking action-packed we have to say, and the inclusion of the ability to recruit in-game Pokémon to use in 1v1 and 2v2 battles sounds rather neat indeed.</p>

<p>Lookin' Mega</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprising absolutely no one, today's Pokémon Presents showcase left us with yet another look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, with a lengthy trailer detailing the game's story, side missions and new Mega Evolutions. And yes, there was more than a little Dragonite thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Let's start with that delightful dragon, shall we? The trailer brought us our first proper look at Mega Dragonite, which sports several "Dragonair-like features" — wings on the head, a pearl on the tail, you know the drill. We can't say that we're completely sold on the design, but more Dragonite is always a good thing.</p>
<p>You'll need to rely on newbies like this one to tackle the rogue Mega-Evolved Pokémon that are springing up across Lumiose City at their own accord. The trailer gives a closer look at that Xenoblade-style combat that we were so interested in after the reveal, and yep, it still looks cool.</p>


<p>For those who weren't watching the presentation live, TPC split the Legends: Z-A section into two trailers, so you can check out the other half below to find out what the game's story will have in store.</p>

<p>If all of that takes your fancy but you haven't picked up a Switch 2 yet (and you don't want to face the Switch 1 version), Nintendo has revealed that a special <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-its-very-own-switch-2-bundle">Legends: Z-A Switch 2 bundle</a> will be launching alongside the game on <strong>16th October</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Supermassive Games released a statement in which it confirmed that the studio has laid off 36 people, cuts that it says were made for the studio to "<em>adapt our team structure to better align</em>" with the changes and challenges of the video game industry. The studio also confirmed that Directive 8020, which was due to launch this October, has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>The statement was published to the<a href="https://x.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211"> studio's official X account</a>, where it writes "<em>This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected</em>."</p>



<p>Directive 8020, which was announced last year at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">Gamescom 2024</a>, and was supposed to be out this coming October 2, 2025, will now release sometime in "<em>the first half of 2026</em>." Supermassive adds "<em>the response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Directive 8020 wasn't the only game Supermassive had launching in October of this year though, with the other being <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">Little Nightmares III</a>, which is due out on October 10, 2025, and only gets a short mention at the end of the statement, where Supermassive claims that these layoffs have "<em>no impact on the development of Little Nightmares III</em>."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-quarry-dark-pictures-dev-supermassive-layoffs-third-of-staff/">February 2024</a>, Supermassive Games laid off a third of its staff, once again citing challenges in the changing video game industry. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online a few days back makes the experience more immersive than ever before, introducing some choice improvements to main character V's behavior.</p>



<p>As the name implies, the More Responsive V mod, now available for download for free from Nexus Mod, makes the game's main character react more dynamically to the world. With the mod, V will respond vocally to being bumped, hit by vehicles, and in a lot of other scenarios where a voiced reaction is expected, such as stealing vehicles, MaxTac's arrival, and more. With the mod, which uses unused voice lines that seem to have been created specifically for similar scenarios, V will also respond to Johnny Silverhand's comments while driving in a vehicle. You can check out the mod in action by watching this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPyNvkZuaNE">video</a>.</p>



<p>Despite having been released almost five years ago, Cyberpunk 2077 is still receiving plenty of love from CD Projekt Red and modders alike. A new 2.3 patch went live <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">last week</a>, introducing new content and features on all platforms, such as AMD FSR 4, FSR 3.1 Frame Generation support on PC and proper VRR support on consoles. The introduction of VRR support, according to Digital Foundry, is the closest we will get to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vrr-support-closest-to-official-ps5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patch.</a></p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <p>Picture the scene. You and someone you like are gettin' it on. Maybe with Barry White crooning away in the background, scented candles, sweaty palms. Then, one of you touches a box and boom, a bloke who's clearly come out on the wrong end of a trip to an arts &amp; crafts shop walks in with some hooks and says stuff about pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>Such is (pretty much) the way of classic 80s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> film Hellraiser, and therefore such is the plot of the trailer for the very first full game based on it. Said game's a slice of singleplayer survival horror dubbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clive-barkers-hellraiser-revival">Clive Barker's Hellraiser: Revival</a>, from Evil: Within devs Boss Team Games and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> publishers Saber Interactive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Play the story of Aidan, who must use the power of a mysterious puzzle box – the Genesis Configuration – to help his girlfriend Sunny’s escape from the otherworldly hellscape of the Labyrinth," reads the suitable hellish blurb. "Wield the powers of the box to survive your bargain with the infamous Pinhead and do battle with the horrific cult devoted to the Cenobites."</p>
<p>In a fun twist, original actor Doug Bradley's reprised the role of Cenobite leader Pinhead in the game, and it'll be his first appearance behind the pin-laden visage in two decades.</p>

<p>Clive Barker himself's been looped in on crafting the story, and he's been a fan of Boss Team and Saber's dedication to the pursuit of gaming pleasure. "They’ve immersed themselves in the Hellraiser universe, capturing its essence — the seductive pull of suffering, the beauty within the grotesque — and forged a narrative that invites players to step beyond the threshold," the writer and filmmaker said. "I’m eager for both the curious and the damned to experience this new chapter in the Hellraiser mythos, where every moment balances on the brink of nightmare and revelation."</p>
<p>Sounds cool, but maybe make sure stray children aren't likely to walk in on you playing it, given <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1551980/">the Steam page</a>'s lengthy content warning. There's no release date or even window on that Steam page yet, so you'll just have to find joy in slightly less carnal pleasures for the minute.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-publishers-reveal-hellraiser-revival-a-singleplayer-horror-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead]]></content:encoded>

DJ Pikachu has been and gone, taking the latest Pokémon Direct (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvzYU-UIcU">Pokémon Presents</a> if you must) with him. And this time around, we got Pokénews aplenty, with small furry fistfuls of new Z-A details, some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> updates, a new Pokémon puzzler, and more. But if you missed it - or simply need a refresher - you'll find everything announced below.
</p>
<h3>A quick bit on this year's Pokémon World Championships</h3>
<p>
First up, a reminder that the Pokémon World Championships are coming to Anaheim, California this year. They're running from 15th-17th August, with competitors set to do battle across the likes of Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Pokémon Go, and Pokémon Unite. All competitors get a "celebratory" promo card, so hooray. There're <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">more details over on the Pokémon website</a>.
</p>
<h3>Here's a look at Pokémon Concierge's upcoming new episodes</h3>
<figure>
<p>

<p>
Pokémon Concierge - Netflix's gorgeously animated and well-received TV spin-off - is returning to the streaming service with more episodes, and we got an eye-catching trailer to remind us of that. Better yet, there's an air date for the new episodes, which we now know will be available from 4th September.
</p>
<h3>Wallace and Gromit animation studio is making a Pokémon show</h3>
<figure>

<p>
Aardman Animation, the studio behind the much-loved Wallace and Gromit series, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-meets-shaun-the-sheep-in-upcoming-aardman-stop-motion-animated-series">working on a new stop-motion Pokémon TV show</a>. It promises a unique look at the Pokémon world, told from the critters' perspective, all presented using the "signature Aardman sense of character and comedy and craft". It's called Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch and Pichu and - as you can see in its teaser trailer above - looks delightful. This one's due to arrive in 2027.
</p>
<h3>A quick peek at Japan's PokéPark Kanto theme park attraction</h3>
<p>
PokéPark Kanto - the first "permanent outdoor Pokémon attraction" - is opening within Japan's Yomiuriland amusement park "soon" and we got a little taste of the activities visitors can enjoy should they find themselves within its walls. It's divided into two area, Sedge Town and the Pokémon Forest. In the forest, visitors can see various Pokémon interacting with each other, while the town is an area where Pokémon and Trainers gather. It's opening in 2026, with tickets set to go on sale later this year.
</p>
<h3>Here's what to expect from the Pokémon Go Fest 2025: Max Finale</h3>

<p>
Next, a bit of news about Pokémon Go Fest 2025: Max Finale, which runs from 23rd-24th August, heralding back-to-back appearances from various Max Pokémon, and an opportunity for players to encounter Eternatus globally for the first time. There's also a promo code - GOFESTMAX - you can enter on the website for a chance of catching a Gigantamax Pokémon.
</p>
<h3>A quick round-up of everything going on in Pokémon's mobile spin-offs</h3>
<p>
And in other mobile news, Pokémon Masters EX will see Carmine &amp; Sinistcha appear in their featured Poké Fair from 29th July to 6th September, while Lapra - in its five-star sea captain outfit - is set to appear in Pokémon Café Remix starting 23rd July until 21st August. Sea adventure-themed decorations are also being added to café customisation soon, with Alolan Mouth, Totodile, and Minccino also on the way in special crew-themed outfits "one after another".
</p>
<p>
Over in Pokémon Sleep, players can research Raikou, Entei, and Suicune this September, and a new area - Amber Canyon - arrives in November. As for Pokémon Unite, Latios joins on 18th July and Latias arrives on 8th August, all to commemorate the games fourth anniversary. 
</p>
<h3>And a sentence about the Pokémon Trading Card Game</h3>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolution | Showcase Trailer" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sms37W1x3-M?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>
<h3>Pokémon Friends revealed and out today</h3>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Puzzles, Plush, and Pokémon Await in Pokémon Friends! 💡" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNJb21AX0-4?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
And if that's not enough spin-off games to be getting on with, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-friends-is-a-plushie-focused-puzzle-game-and-its-out-now">there's now Pokémon Friends</a>, a Pokémon-themed mini-game puzzler featuring sliding blocks, rotating tracks, and more. Solving puzzles unlocks digital plushies you can use to decorate your in-game "plush room", and it's available today on Switch, iOS and Android. 
</p>
<h3>Some Pokémon Violet and Scarlet news, including more Tera Raids</h3>
<p>
After a quick reminder Pokémon Violet and Scarlet now have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> update improving framerate and resolution, we got the news a fresh Tera Raid battle event starts tomorrow, 23rd July, featuring shiny versions of Wo-Chien, Chien-Pao, Ting-Lu, and Chi-Yu, with each being available for one week starting 23rd July and ending 14th September. However, just completing a battle isn't enough to secure the Pokémon - you can only add them to your team after they've been defeated 1m times by the community. Various weekly Pokémon Mass Outbreak events are set to run concurrently, and there's also a tracksuit apparel item you can acquire by entering the code STRACKSU1T or VTRACKSU1T into Scarlet and Violet respectively.
</p>
<h3>Another look at Pokémon Champions</h3>

<p>
The previously announced Pokémon Champions, which lets players battle each other in an arena using new or previous Pokémon Partners (you'll need to use Pokémon Home in order to access the latter), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-stadium-alike-new-game-pokemon-champions-gets-a-2026-release-date-in-new-action-packed-gameplay-trailer">got another airing during today's showcase</a>, offering a look at battling, the newly revealed training feature, and more. There's still no release date for Pokémon Champions yet, but it's coming to Switch, iOS, and Android next year.
</p>
<h3>And lastly, Pokémon Z-A returns with fresh details</h3>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="[UK] Start a New Story in Lumiose City with Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3W9npYPFk0?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
And finally, the big one: Pokémon Z-A. GameFreak had plenty to say on its latest mainline Pokémon entry - here seen running on Switch 2 - including a look at Lumiose City, its story, Z-A Royale battles, side activities (including character customisation <em>and</em> customisable Furfrous), plus photo mode. You can read more on Z-A's latest showing - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">details on Rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon</a> - elsewhere on Eurogamer. If you want to know what Pokés will be making an appearance, check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-pokemon-legends-z-a-returning">returning Pokémon</a> list. It's out 16th October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-bundle-announced">alongside a Switch 2 bundle</a>, and that, I'm afraid, is the end of today's news.
