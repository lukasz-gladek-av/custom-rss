		<p>If you’re looking for a cute, classic action-adventure, then going off the game’s demo, The Knightling should be high up on your list. Coming from developer Twirlbound, The Knightling sees you taking on the role of a rookie knight who, while waiting the return of his master Sir Lionstone, decides to try and do some good. Set in the realm of Clessia, which is bereft of a lead knight, it’s up to you to look after the populace. The only problem is that nobody takes you seriously because, well, you’re just a kid, and you don’t even have a sword. What kind of a knight doesn’t have a sword?</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Steam Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjOWFtKNGV4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Knightling has definitely taken a leaf out of Captain America’s comic book though, and he’s equipped with a massive shield that’s as good at offense as it is for defence. There’s the expected throwing and bouncing off things that Steve Rogers loves, but the Knightling can also use his shield as a makeshift sledge, hopping inside it and sliding down from great heights.</p>


<p>Captain America’s shield also doesn’t talk to you, or have a name. Magnustego – Magnus for short – is a legendary magical shield who gives you tips and hints as you go along, or berates you for using him in an unshield-ly way, and he’s a constant companion through The Knightlings adventure. You can upgrade him along the way, increasing the strength of your attacks or adding new moves to your repertoire.</p>


<p>The Knightling is a cheery soul, if a little perturbed that no one thinks they’re going to be able to do much, at least here in the demo. He’s thoughtful though, and keen to help, ingratiating himself with the townsfolk by helping them out with small-scale issues. There’s definitely echoes of Ocarina of Time here, just in the cheerful, colourful do-gooding and the playful music that bops along in the background.</p>
<p>Combat is fast and cute, smashing monsters with your shield before unleashing a huge special attack when you’ve charged the gauge. Healing is performed by snacking on whatever food you’ve been able to nab, pulling up carrots from the ground being the first of these, restocking the healing gauge, which you can then use when you’re in need. It feels pretty generous – this is not a Soulslike – but there’s still danger lurking from the monsters that roam the land.</p>
<p>You earn praise for everything you do, including, it seems, jumping to the top of houses and high vantage points. If anyone has played the Crackdown series they’ll know how satisfying and strangely moreish this, so I’m hoping it’s something that continues to appear throughout, pushing you to climb and jump higher and higher. There are some pretty tricky platforming sections just in this early section, and I can see things ramping up as you progress further and further into the game’s open world.</p>

<p>I love the look of The Knightling. It’s clear, it’s characterful and there’s just something adorable about the Knightling’s big eyes and the chunky world. The audio definitely helps with the atmosphere too, from the mumbled words everyone utters to the ebbs and peaks of the orchestral soundtrack. It creates a fantastical world with an economy of design that’s refreshing, but it’s nonetheless utterly beguiling, despite the simplicity.</p>
<p>I am massively excited to play more of The Knightling – it’s light-hearted, action packed, and full of character, and a change in pace to the glossy Unreal Engine 5 open worlds elsewhere. This gorgeous landscape is also yours to explore, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/">a demo available on Steam right now</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one, as it looks like it could be one of this year’s sleeper hits when it comes to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

But where does that leave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Rockstar parent company Take-Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">reiterated GTA 6’s fall 2025 release window</a>, but now we know Borderlands 4 is out in September, there’s no chance GTA 6 will be out the same month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So when? October? November? December 2025? All seem up for grabs now for GTA 6. The risk of course is that Take-Two ends up cannibalizing its big 2025 games by releasing them too close together. And let’s not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-mafia-the-old-country-to-gta-6-dev-says-theyre-not-as-similar-as-youd-think">Mafia: The Old Country launches at some point summer 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Take-Two’s big games, and by that we really mean GTA 6, end up doing more harm to each other than good by releasing too close to each other? That’s a question we put to Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick in an interview ahead of the company's third quarter financial results. As you’d expect, Zelnick said Take-Two is planning its releases to avoid a risk of cannibalization, insisting the timing is driven by a desire to “respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, I think we will plan the releases so as not to have that be a problem,” Zelnick said. “And what we found is when you're giving consumers hits, they tend to be interested in pursuing other hits. In other words, I've said this many times, even when the hits aren't ours, they're a good thing for the industry. In this case, we hope that the hits will largely be ours. So we feel really good about it and I think that we will time our releases so as to respect the consumer's need to spend a lot of time playing these hit games before they go on to the next.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the context of Borderlands 4’s just-announced September release date, when might GTA 6 come out? If Take-Two wants Borderlands 4 fans to spent “a lot of time” playing before moving on to, say, GTA 6, how long is a lot of time? One month? Two months? Three?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid all this speculation is of course the prospect that GTA 6 will be delayed either into early winter, or at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look, there's always a risk of slippage and I think as soon as you say words like absolutely, you jinx things," Zelnick responded when IGN asked how confident he was that Rockstar would hit fall 2025 for GTA 6. "So we feel really good about it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Borderlands 4, Zelnick insisted the brand remains “really strong” despite the disastrous <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/borderlands-the-movie">Borderlands movie</a>, which bombed at the box office and was mauled by critics and fans alike. In fact, Zelnick said that the movie’s failure won’t impact the potential success of Borderlands 4 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's no secret that the movie was a disappointment, but interestingly, it really benefited our catalog sales,” Zelnick explained. “So actually the effect was quite positive. It would've assumed been more positive if the movie had been better received. But the brand is really strong. We feel great about Borderlands 4.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach may not have featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>, but news on the game is expected soon.</p>
<p>On 9th March, director <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> will speak at a special panel event on the game at South by Southwest (SXSW), sharing new details. Could we finally get a release date?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1WtK_6q2P4">YouTube stream</a> for the event is already published, with the description stating the game will arrive "exclusively on PlayStation 5 later this year". That mirrors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">Sony's latest financial report</a>, which also confirms a 2025 release.</p>

<p>SXSW "celebrates the convergence of tech, film, music, education, and culture", so is a fitting setting for Kojima's next game.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kojima's brand and that of his games is enough to star in a standalone panel event, away from Sony's own State of Play.</p>
<p>Footage of the game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-officially-titled-on-the-beach-coming-2025">first shared at a Sony event</a>, though, back in January last year. This was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">Death Stranding 2 panel at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in September.</p>
<p>Since then, further details are eagerly anticipated - especially the release date.</p>
<p>Kojima has certainly been very active recently on social media, sharing posts suggesting he's busy working on a trailer for... something.</p>
<p>He also admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-ponders-advancing-age-and-how-long-he-can-stay-creative-as-death-stranding-studio-enters-crunch">Kojima Productions has entered "crunch time"</a>, as Death Stranding 2 nears completion.</p>
<p>"At this age, I can't help but think about how much longer I'll be able to stay 'creative'", he wrote. "I want to keep going for the rest of my life, but is it 10 more years? 20? Every day feels like I'm racing against the clock."</p>
<p>After Death Stranding 2, Kojima has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-teases-xbox-horror-od-with-enigmatic-first-trailer">Microsoft-backed OD</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">Metal Gear Solid spiritual successor Physint</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tides of Annihilation was another new game announced during the State of Play, and it is an action title set in a ruined London. In this reality, London was destroyed by an invasion originating from another world, taking out everyone except main character Gwendolyn. She is on a mission to find and save her family, using the power of spectral knights to take on foes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ3fDz_xCio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Tides of Annihilation, the spectral knights and enemies are all based off of Arthurian mythology. Each of the ten knights have their own unique powers that Gwendolyn can use to in her battles. London will also undergo changes as you explore, switching between Medieval and modern timelines, looking for grail shards to figure out how this invasion occurred. As you wander, you will see Colossal Knights walking around too, and they are not just part scenery but an additional challenge to take on. Developer Eclipse Game Studio also confirmed that those with a PS5 Pro will have access to an exclusive Enhanced mode that adds <em>“higher resolution, ray tracing, improved image fidelity, and smoother 60fps gameplay.”</em></p>
<p>A release date for Tides of Annihilation is yet to be confirmed, but it will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>During today’s earnings call, Sony revealed that the PS5 has sold over 75 units in its lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q3_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings call</a> today, the gaming and network services segment was the highlight of the show. PS5 crossed the 75 million milestone by selling 9.5 million units in Q4. PlayStation Networks’ monthly active users were up, too, increasing from 118 million in FY23 Q3 to 129 million in FY24 Q3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s not all; PS5 and PS4 topped 95.9 million units sold in software, gaining a 6.2 million increase from last year’s 89.7 million. During this time, 11.6 million units of first-party games were sold, which decreased from 12.3 million last year. Moreover, out of the 95.9 million, 74% were full-game digital software downloads, down from last year’s 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to PlayStation 5’s growing sales, the current-generation console is just 1.5 million units behind the PS4 in outselling it during the same period. The console manufacturer believes that this number will only increase with the release of first-party games like Ghost of Yotei and third-party games like GTA 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/days-gone-remastered-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Days Gone Remastered</a> is coming to PlayStation 5 with Pro and VRR support on April 25. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here’s everything that was announced</a> during PlayStation’s State of Play event yesterday. What are your thoughts on the PS5 selling over 75 million units?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
We interrupt our regular schedule of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-developers-warn-fans-to-watch-out-for-a-fraudulent-playtest">fish puns</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-is-powerwash-simulator-for-holes">naughty jokes about holes</a> to warn you that a huge chunk of celestial debris <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/2025/02/07/nasa-continues-to-monitor-orbit-of-near-earth-asteroid-2024-yr4/">has a 2.3% chance of impacting Earth in December 2032</a> and wiping out the city of Bradford. I name Bradford because it’s the first city that occurs to me and also, because several of my ancient enemies live there, but the asteroid could hit anywhere. Where do you live? Maybe wear a hard hat when you go Xmas shopping in 2032. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_YR4">Asteroid 2024 YR4</a> loiters somewhere along our planet’s orbital trajectory, like a rake in the grass.
</p>
<p>
If this were the 1980s we’d seek comfort in the pages of the Hitchhiker’s Guide To The Galaxy, which has the words “DON’T PANIC” in large, friendly letters on the cover. But it’s the twenty-twenties and nobody reads Douglas Adams anymore, so instead I’m playing Neal.fun’s free tool <a href="https://neal.fun/asteroid-launcher/">Asteroid Launcher</a>, which lets you pick asteroids of different sizes and compositions like you’re choosing brands of cereal, then splat them capriciously against world map data provided by Apple Inc.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
YR24 is said to be 130-300 feet across, and is made of stone. Let’s split the difference and say it’s 215 feet across, or a few short of 70 metres. According to Asteroid Launcher, if a 70 metre wide stone asteroid were to explode in the atmosphere 2.4 kilometres above my flat*, while travelling at 17 kilometres a second, the devastation would be catastrophic. The resulting 211 decibel shockwave would totally obliterate my favourite chippie down the road. My local Cafe Neros at the bottom of the hill would experience winds faster than the storms on Jupiter. My favourite curry shop in London would likely be levelled, which I guess is fine because I think they’re planning to move anyway. 
</p>
<p>
It sounds unbearable, but it could be worse. My favourite London takeaway joint would fall slightly outside the blast radius, and people eating in my favourite vegan pizza place might not even glance up from their Pepper-no-nis. Curiously, if the asteroid were 30 metres bigger, big enough to make landfall, the area-of-effect would apparently be smaller and the casualties, fewer, give or take a few extra from earthquakes. I can’t remotely speak to the accuracy of whatever science Asteroid Launcher runs on. I’m fairly sure it’s not a standard reporting tool at any major space agency. If it is, we have more immediate problems to worry about than YR24.
</p>
<p>
What drives somebody to read about an extremely unlikely asteroid impact and immediately load up a free browser game in order to simulate their own destruction? I don’t know, but it’s an instinct that informs a lot of video games. Patient zero could be the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. We’ve all had that moment in SimCity, right, when the infrastructure is humming and all your residential, industrial and commercial zones are in perfect equilibrium, and a rasping voice in your ear says “Screw it – die, you pack of filthy little law-abiding conformists”, and you push the Godzilla button.</p>
<p>It’s the same nihilism that flowers within my spleen when I read the label on a bottle of shower gel made by a company that whimsically declares its boss to be “Nature”. Video games are great at venting such feelings, which is perhaps less constructive when it means, say, dissipating pent-up anguish about climate change, but surely forgiveable enough when it comes to the fickle motions of marauding space rocks.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, if you need a pick-me-up after reading all that, I recommend sumptuous planet-nurser <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reus-2">Reus 2</a>. Oh look, it was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1875060/view/499436070246548643?l=english">recently updated</a>! With a selection of… natural disasters.

            <p>The flash flood of marketing that poured forth from PlayStation's State Of Play last night splashes wetly upon we PC players too. Among the teasers and crossover announcements, 2K revealed the release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> in a short 'n' shooty trailer. I'm not a big fan of this long-running looter shooter. But in showing us its release date Take-Two have given us an indication of when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will <em>not</em> release. And that's mildly interesting.</p>

<p>Borderlands 4 is coming out September 23rd, as celebrated by the maniacally cackling mascot at the end of the trailer. The lootsy shootsy was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-looks-ready-to-drop-the-hottest-memes-of-2011-in-first-look-trailer">announced shortly before Christmas</a> last year, and will have the usual 4-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a>, random weapons, and sense of "humour". This time your team of lootbox addicts will be battling "the oppressive Timekeeper, a ruthless dictator who dominates the masses from on high."</p>
<p>So, Borderlands again. Still, there's a fun bit of obvious deduction to glean here. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick reassured shareholders in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-hitting-consoles-in-autumn-says-take-two-boss-promise">an earnings call</a> last week that the company was confident they were giving enough space to their big releases. That's to be expected, publishers like to space out their games for maximum sales. All of which suggests GTA 6 probably won't hit the shelves in September. Or at least the weeks around Borderlands 4 will be a big buffer zone. Zelnick himself has twice confirmed the open world crim sim is on-target for an autumn 2025 release. </p>
<p>It's fun to speculate that the other big games of the season are playing "release date chicken" because of Grand Theft Auto 6, which still hasn't announced when it will arrive to nuke all the other games released that week from orbit. But studios can always reschedule once they see it coming, and some game buyers don't care about GTA at all. Still, it feels like Take-Two has eliminated at least a couple of possible weeks from the guessing game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Activision Blizzard staff have hit back at the eyebrow-raising claim made this week by former boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/bobby-kotick">Bobby Kotick</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bobby-kotick-says-activision-blizzard-fake-lawsuits-were-simply-a-union-plan-to-drive-up-membership">the company's harassment lawsuits - and an employee petition seeking the CEO's removal - were "fake"</a>.
</p>
<p>
The high-profile ABetterABK workers group, which spearheaded much of the company's employee activism at the time, <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1889787591056052523">responded to Eurogamer's coverage of Kotick's comments via social media last night</a> and stated that "the executives of our company did not protect us, and often made the situation worse or directly perpetuated the harm".
</p>
<p>
"The trauma, discrimination, and abuse that our coworkers and former coworkers endured is not fake or a 'plan to drive union membership'," the group stated. "Our unions were born from the very real and harmful way executives reacted when made aware of these situations."
</p>
<p>
Speaking via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo&amp;ab_channel=KleinerPerkins">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick had suggested the legal action Activision Blizzard had faced under his tenure, from multiple US government agencies, had been a "plan" by the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union to drive up membership.
</p>
<p>
"A common misinformation tactic used by companies during a union campaign is to assert that a union is a third party that comes in and makes changes," ABetterABK's statement continued. "This is not true. The workers are the union.
</p>
<p>
"We are not a third party looking for companies to prey on. We are workers with a vested interest in making our company the best it can be."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/judge-prepared-to-approve-activision-blizzards-usd18m-sexual-harassment-settlement-with-eeoc">Activision Blizzard ultimately settled</a> all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-settles-sex-discrimination-lawsuit-for-44m">of the legal action</a> - meaning payouts to staff who faced harassment at the company, and no evidence of systemic patterns of employee abuse ever proven in court.
</p>
<p>
Valentine Powell, a former senior UI engineer who led several employee walkouts, additionally responded with a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/valentineirl.bsky.social/post/3lhziyzv2oo2j">lengthy social media thread</a> commenting on Kotick's comments, and sharing their perspective on life at the company.
</p>
<p>
"During my time at Blizzard I was loud and I was vocal about the issues facing our company, I helped spearhead multiple initiatives to remove systemic tools of harm, and I worked with the newly hired DE&amp;I crew to help form several ERGs, set up our first attendance at Pride, and the Inclusion Nexus," Powell wrote.
</p>
<p>
"There were money barriers, there were political barriers, there were bad actors, basically we were only allowed to make small changes, and most of us knew we needed large ones. One of my first forrays into collective bargaining at Blizzard was the salary spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
"This was years before unionisation was ever discussed," Powell continued. "We gathered a list of about 50 ways people wanted to improve salary and promotions, and refined that list down to 10 bullets with the help of over 100 employees across Blizzard. We presented our list, and were told by leadership 'no'.
</p>
<p>
"We didn't discuss unionisation as a team until months after our first walkouts. We wanted to try to bring light to what was happening and try to fix it ourselves if we could. The first two walkouts were entirely employee run. It was terrifying and amazing and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
"After a couple months of us being loud, Activision Blizzard stopped being nice about it, especially Kotick. I was The One who started the petition to remove Bobby Kotick as CEO. I was the first name on the list, and that petition had nothing to do with CWA."
</p>
<p>
Powell concluded by noting that the CWA had offered support regardless of whether staff were part of the union or not - or whether they would ever join.
</p>
<p>
"Bobby Kotick is trying to paint a false narrative, but its unsurprising," Powell wrote, "he refused to listen to us for years when we tried to handle this stuff without unionisation, and only listened once we actually started unionising."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Kotick claimed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-activision-blizzard-takeover-sparked-by-both-companies-failing-to-buy-tiktok-kotick-says">Microsoft's Activision Blizzard takeover was sparked by both companies failing to buy TikTok</a>.

            <p>Sales of Sony's PS5 console have now reached 75m units, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>
<p>By the end of the previous quarter, PS5 sales had passed 65m. Now, in the latest quarter (ending 31st December 2024), Sony has sold a further 9.5m consoles - the console's best ever quarter.</p>
<p>Overall sales of games and consoles have increased by 16 percent year-on-year, with profits similarly increasing by 37 percent.</p>

<p>Sony attributes these increases to an increase in available units, a boost in non-first-party games (and DLC), and an increase in sales from network services.</p>
<p>The number of monthly active users on PlayStation Network was 129m in the last quarter - that's a record high, and a 43 percent increase from December 2017.</p>
<p>What's more, 42 percent of PS5 purchasers in the last quarter were new PlayStation Network users, thereby showing an increase in the overall userbase.</p>
<p>PS Plus revenue also increased by 20 percent year-on-year, which the company attributed to users moving to higher tiers. Digital game sales have also increased: 74 percent of game sales this year, compared with 66 percent last year.</p>
<p>Sony also released the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in this last quarter, and while it hasn't separated console sales in this report, this has likely contributed to the boost in hardware sales.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was a strong release for Sony in this last quarter - it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">previously stated 1.5m sales in its first month</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has also been an ongoing success for Sony in 2024. That compares to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> in 2023's equivalent period as the company's most prominent release.</p>
<p>Lastly, Sony confirmed that both Ghost of Yotei and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On the Beach are still on schedule to release this year. Neither game showed up in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/state-of-play-february-2025-everything-announced">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a> studio Housemarque sound like they're aiming to put more emphasis on the <em>lite </em>part of the roguelite formula with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, their next loop 'em up space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/genres/shooter">shooter</a> arriving exclusive to PlayStation 5 next year and likely on PC sometime after that, if past time loops are anything to go on.</p>
<p>You'll be exploring a lost space colony as Arjun Devraj, a "Soltari Enforcer" played by Midnight Mass actor and big nerd Rahul Kohli. The planet you're on is named 'Carcosa', perhaps suggesting a continuation of the cosmic horror bits that Returnal did so well.</p>

<p>It does sound <em>very</em> similar to Returnal otherwise, which is no bad thing. If you missed that one, it was a third person shooter with roguelite and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> elements that stood out from the pack through incredibly nifty gunfeel and enemy design, and a pretty singular atmosphere of sci-fi tinged dread. It was, dare I say, cosmic horror done right.</p>
<p>That said, it could also be very punishing until you got your bearings, which I imagine put some folks off early. Saros is aiming to do things <em>a little differently</em>. I can't write "a little differently" without my internal monologue making it sound like it's written in cool guy voice with The Fonz fingers. It is actually a little different though. From the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/12/announcing-saros-the-next-game-from-housemarque-coming-2026/">PlayStation blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A key gameplay distinction between Saros and Returnal is permanent resources and progression making every death valuable. After every death you will face a changed world, but in Saros you will be able to choose and permanently upgrade your loadout from an evolving set of weapons and suit upgrades to “come back stronger” to overcome the challenges you face on Carcosa.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roguelite meta progression?! Surely no valued RPS commenters will have strong and often insightful opinions on <em>that</em> universally good design feature!</p>
<p>It took the original Returnal a couple of years to come to PC. Sony have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-have-bought-housemarque-developers-of-returnal-and-nex-machina">scooped up Housemarque since then</a>, so whether this complicates matters I'm not sure. Sony have talked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-may-invest-more-in-its-efforts-to-bring-playstation-games-to-pc">focusing more on PC in the past</a>, and we've seen previously exclusive titles hit Steam with increasing frequency lately. They also finally dropped that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-finally-drop-the-psn-account-requirement-that-annoyed-every-pc-player">pesky PSN account requirement last month</a>. Oh, and do play Housemarque's other game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nex-machina">Nex Machina</a> if you haven't, it's excellent.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

<p>You play as an advanced battle android called a Hyper Unit which can dash, grapple and wall-run through levels dealing out damage with lots of big juicy weapons. As an extra twist you can also roll out, quite literally, by transforming into a massive metal ball and smashing into enemies. You have to battle through Moebius, a vast monolithic city high above the planet’s surface protecting the mysterious Hive Tower, and the world below, known as Vulcan. </p>

The points you get with a normal attack increase, and the number of coins that appear increases even more with a Shikigami attack.</p><p><strong>High Tension MAX System</strong></p><p>Equipped with a new function that satisfies your insatiable passion for shooting games!</p><p>A system that consumes one special attack to activate. There is a short period of invincibility when activated. A red gauge will be displayed at the top edge of the screen for a certain period of time, and until it runs out, “T.B.S. judgment will always be 8 times (≒ always in a high-tension shot state)” and “the amount of coins appearing will be 1.5 times.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a trailer below.</p><h2><span>Steam Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam &quot;Castle of Shikigami 3&quot; Promotional Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEMzQQ8jE0M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Steam『式神の城Ⅲ』プロモーションビデオ" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWQEGhsXoPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players will experience the opening tutorial and introduction, character and mech customization, an explorable space station, all three core game modes, a training room, and thirteen distinct mechs or “Strikers.” Other new updates in this beta include revised maps for the six-versus-six Operation VERGE and three-versus-three Ace Arena game modes, a player reputation system, balance adjustments to various Strikers, combat finishing moves, and new customization options for pilots and mechs.</p><p>The all new player-versus-player-versus-environment mode “Mashmak”—available to the public for the first time—sees pilots battling over the Mashmak Isles, which hold the largest reserves of Eruptive Inorganic Carbide (EIC), also known as “Corite.” The region recently came under the control of an organization known as Theia’s Vanguard, and their destructive actions are accelerating the spread of Corite, pushing the world to the brink of disaster. Constant battle for control of the islands has created unpredictable Corite pulse storms, which are capable of devouring everything in their path.</p><p>To handle these harsh conditions, new equipment has been developed to give Striker pilots an advantage. Pilots can choose to deploy a selection of new equipment including weapon pickups and weaponized gliders to dynamically enhance their Striker’s capabilities in close-quarters combat, healing, sniping, suppressive fire, and more in order to complete the mission. As the battle rages on, more powerful weapons and equipment will be made available for the truly hardened pilot.</p></blockquote><p><em>Mecha BREAK</em> is due out for Xbox Series and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, followed by PlayStation 5 later in 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Caught between paranormal containment failure, a military crusade, and chaos from a dozen realms, the world’s greatest minds must survive against the universe’s biggest threats.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Home to the world’s greatest minds, GATE operates a global network of secretive research laboratories, spanning every field of scientific study—and the realms beyond.</p><p>As a GATE employee you extend the bounds of human knowledge, and seek to explain the unexplainable—including anomalies and paranormal entities: from gravity-distorting artifacts to supernatural creatures with an unbridled instinct for violence. Safety, security, and secrecy are of the utmost importance… usually.</p><p>After a catastrophic containment breach, your workplace has become a cosmic battle zone: anomalous entities are on the loose, enemies from other dimensions are invading via portals, and an arcane military sect—known as The Order—is targeting personnel and entities indiscriminately, aiming to seize artifacts and put an end to the chaos.</p><p>Containment procedures have failed and help isn’t on the way. Stranded miles beneath the surface, it’s up to you and your fellow scientists to band together, plan your escape, and make this underground complex your new home—for now.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p><em>Abiotic Factor</em> brings a 90s science-fiction twist and rich character progression to the <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [443 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> open world survival crafting genre. Up to six players can choose their PHDs, build their scientist, gear up, and explore a massive subterranean complex, filled with supernatural artifacts, transdimensional foes, and science experiments gone awry.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Science Meets Violence</strong> – Between alien threats hunting their next meal, trigger happy soldiers, and the world’s most advanced robotic security forces attacking personnel working overtime, there’s no shortage of danger. As a scientist, fighting isn’t your forte, so you’ll need to put your PHD to work to outwit your opponents: craft ingenious and outlandish tools, weapons and gear, from simple nets and wooden bats to laser-cannons and elaborate traps – everything your big science brain can muster!</li><li><strong>Maintain a Healthy Work-Life Balance</strong> – Make yourself at home—you’re here for the long haul. Scavenge resources from vacant offices and empty labs, raid vending machines, and steal company property to build a new base of operations as you explore the facility.

<p>During the State of Play event, Split Fiction, the new project from Hazelight, received a new trailer showcasing some of parts of the campaign.</p>



<p>Hazelight is the studio behind popular titles like A Way Out and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=it+takes+two">It Takes Two</a>, with the latter winning the Game of the Year award in 2019.</p>

<p>Continuing their established style, Split Fiction is a cooperative game featuring two protagonists, Mio and Zoe. The two are writers who specialize in distinct genres; one focuses on sci-fi adventures while the other creates fantasy stories. In the beginning of the game, they find themselves trapped within their own narratives.</p>



<p>With a diverse level design, stunning visuals, and highly creative gameplay, Split Fiction could be a serious contender for Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Split Fiction will be released on March 6th for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, and the EA app. Players will also be able to invite a friend to play for free on any platform (with crossplay between PS, Xbox &amp; PC) using the Friend Pass.</p>
