<p>There are hundreds, if not <strong>thousands </strong>of esports teams out there in the industry. From grassroots-level organisations to multi-national corporations, the esports industry is a diverse place when it comes to the organisations that drive it forward. In this guide, we’re breaking down the most successful esports teams ever, breaking down the top esports teams by their total earnings in the time that they’ve been operational.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-best-esports-teams">What Are The Best Esports Teams?</h2>



<p>For this ranking, we’re simply looking at which esports teams have won the most money over the years. It’s often a subjective debate, and everyone has their idea of which organisation can be considered the best esports team in the world, but the numbers can’t be disputed.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at the most successful esports teams ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-paris-saint-germain-esports">10. Paris Saint-Germain Esports</h3>



<p>This esports team that’s attached to one of the world’s most famous soccer clubs isn’t the likeliest candidate for the top ten most successful esports teams ever, but here we are. This team has beaten the likes of Gen.G, Astralis, Cloud9, OpTic Gaming, and Vitality to make this ranking, and since being live, PSG Esports has won <strong>$19,734,315.30</strong> from 178 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-9-virtus-pro">9. Virtus.pro</h3>



<p>Virtus is a legendary organisation with some huge wins in the Counter-Strike and Dota 2 spaces, but over the years, the team has dipped in and out of almost every esports game in the business. By the time of writing, Virtus.pro had earned a whopping <strong>$20,356,050.84</strong> from a staggering 687 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-faze-clan">8. FaZe Clan</h3>



<p>FaZe Clan is synonymous with the gaming and esports industry and is arguably the most prolific pro gaming brand in the world. It fields teams in a wide array of esports games and has one of the biggest followings in esports. It just edges out Virtus.pro with <strong>$20,438,038.58</strong> earned across 763 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-team-secret">7. Team Secret</h3>



<p>Like many others, Team Secret has made it big thanks to Dota 2. The vast majority of this esports team’s earnings have been secured in the popular MOBA game, despite the organisation dabbling in many other titles. By today, the team has earned <strong>$20,664,835.51</strong> across 424 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-fnatic">6. Fnatic</h3>



<p>Fnatic is one of the oldest esports teams in the world – and one of the wealthiest esports teams, too. From Call of Duty to Hearthstone, and from League of Legends to StarCraft II, Fnatic has competed across one of the most diverse ranges of titles <strong>ever</strong>, raking in a serious sum of cash over the years – <strong>$21,434,276.82 </strong>from 1167 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-natus-vincere">5. Natus Vincere</h3>



<p>Natus Vincere is one of the best Counter-Strike teams on the planet, but don’t call it a one-trick team. Over the lifecycle of this esports organisation, huge stacks of cash have been secured in games like PUBG, World of Tanks, and Fortnite, but CSGO is where the team shone the brightest. In more than a decade, Natus Vincere earned <strong>$22,687,824.99</strong> from 786 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-evil-geniuses">4. Evil Geniuses</h3>



<p>Evil Geniuses is a legendary and timeless esports organisation with a stunning bankroll. It’s one of the best esports teams simply because of what it has contributed to the growth of the industry over the years, and it has dominated games like Dota 2 and Valorant. In 1019 tournaments, Evil Geniuses has claimed <strong>$28,567,423.99</strong> in prize money.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-team-spirit">3. Team Spirit</h3>



<p>Team Spirit is a remarkable organisation with a solid foundation. It was founded in 2015, which makes it one of the newest esports teams to make it big, but in that time, vast piles of cash have been secured by the organisation’s many squads. It helps that Team Spirit has won some of the most valuable esports tournaments ever, pulling in <strong>$31,046,277.40</strong> in 253 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-og">2. OG</h3>



<p>If you hadn’t guessed already, many of the most successful esports teams made their money in Dota 2 because of the value of The International, the most valuable esports tournament in history (well, behind the Esports World Cup). That’s no different where OG is concerned.</p>



<p>In both 2018 and 2019, OG won The International, along with several other tournaments, establishing itself as one of the best Dota 2 teams in history and bringing home some serious cash. By today, this esports team has won <strong>$38,552,932.44</strong> in just 192 tournaments.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-team-liquid">1. Team Liquid</h3>



<p>Team Liquid secures the number one spot on the list of the most successful esports teams by a staggering distance. This organisation was founded in 2000 and has since blossomed into one of the most powerful companies in the esports industry, working on a global scale to cover every major esports title. </p>



<p>It has been a driving force of success in Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, and StarCraft, netting an eye-watering <strong>$51,670,605.53</strong> from an insane number of tournaments – 2846 at the time of writing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/spectre-divide-ranked-mode-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mountaintop Studios has just revealed that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode is live <strong>now</strong>. It was penned as being a ‘surprise’ for the community, and it can be accessed by securing just five wins in the game’s casual queue. Spectre Divide entered early access on September 3, and by all accounts, it’s doing quite well.</p>



<p>It was confirmed by Mountaintop that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode will feature both solo and team play elements, with players having a separate rank for each category.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-be-challenged">Be Challenged</h2>



<p>In a press release published by Mountaintop Studios, it was revealed that Spectre Divide’s ranked mode will feature seasons that unravel over several months. There will be plenty of rewards up for grabs during these seasons, with players climbing the ladder to unlock rank sprays, gun charms, and skins.</p>



<p>If you think you’re an aspiring pro Spectre Divide player, you’ll want to try your luck in the ranked mode. This game isn’t likely to challenge more established competitive titles like Valorant, but it’s not doing too badly.</p>



<h3 id="h-spectre-divide-ranks">Spectre Divide Ranks</h3>



<p>For those playing Solo, the ranks are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Emerald, Ruby, Diamond, and Champion</li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re looking to secure Team ranks in Spectre Divide, you’ll be going through:</p>



<ul>
<li>Undiscovered, Prospect, Talent, Professional, Elite, International, Superstar, World Class, and Champion</li>
</ul>



<p>To level up, you’ll earn SR (Santai Rating) – but you can lose SR if you’re not winning your matches. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ranked-in-spectre-divide">How to Play Ranked in Spectre Divide</h2>



<p>To get access to Spectre Divide’s ranked mode, you’ll need to play and win five casual matches. Then, you’ll have to sit through five ‘placement’ matches. This is where you’ll earn your initial ranking, and from there, the only way forward is through gruelling combat and sweatier-than-normal competition.</p>



<p>Are you excited to start playing ranked mode in Spectre Divide? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<!-- cache hit 98:single/related:f5d54f3a2b88b90edcc4cf7dc33a85d0 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Friday, Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">announced</a> plans to introduce an open source generative AI tool that will allow game creators to build 3D environments and objects using text prompts, reports <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/09/06/1103707/roblox-is-launching-a-generative-ai-that-builds-3d-environments-in-a-snap/">MIT Tech Review</a>. The feature, which is still under development, may streamline the process of creating game worlds on the popular online platform, potentially opening up more aspects of game creation to those without extensive 3D design skills.</p>

<p>Roblox has not announced a specific launch date for the new AI tool, which is based on what it calls a "3D foundational model." The company shared a demo video of the tool where a user types, "create a race track," then "make the scenery a desert," and the AI model creates a corresponding model in the proper environment.</p>
<p>The system will also reportedly let users make modifications, such as changing the time of day or swapping out entire landscapes, and Roblox says the multimodal AI model will ultimately accept video and 3D prompts, not just text.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tP8nKzMbzVE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video showing Roblox's generative AI model in action.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3D environment generator is part of Roblox's broader AI integration strategy. The company reportedly uses around 250 AI models across its platform, including one that monitors voice chat in <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Moderation_system">real time to enforce content moderation</a>, which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROBLOXBans/comments/16us2oq/what_is_wrong_with_robloxs_moderation/">not always popular</a> with players.</p>
<h2>Next-token prediction in 3D</h2>
<p>Roblox's 3D foundational model approach involves a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">next-token prediction model</a>—a foundation not unlike the large language models (LLMs) that power <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/">ChatGPT</a>. Tokens are fragments of text data that LLMs use to process information. Roblox's system "tokenizes" 3D blocks by treating each block as a numerical unit, which allows the AI model to predict the most likely next structural 3D element in a sequence. In aggregate, the technique can build entire objects or scenery.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                

<p>Anupam Singh, vice president of AI and growth engineering at Roblox, told MIT Tech Review about the challenges in developing the technology. "Finding high-quality 3D information is difficult," Singh said. "Even if you get all the data sets that you would think of, being able to predict the next cube requires it to have literally three dimensions, X, Y, and Z."</p>
<p>According to Singh, lack of 3D training data can create glitches in the results, like a dog with too many legs. To get around this, Roblox is using a second AI model as a kind of visual moderator to catch the mistakes and reject them until the proper 3D element appears. Through iteration and trial and error, the first AI model can create the proper 3D structure.</p>
<p>Notably, Roblox plans to open-source its 3D foundation model, allowing developers and even competitors to use and modify it. But it's not just about giving back—open source can be a two-way street. Choosing an open source approach could also allow the company to utilize knowledge from AI developers if they contribute to the project and improve it over time.</p>
<h2>The ongoing quest to capture gaming revenue</h2>
<p>News of the new 3D foundational model arrived at the 10th annual Roblox Developers Conference in San Jose, California, where the company also announced an ambitious goal to capture 10 percent of global gaming content revenue through the Roblox ecosystem, and the introduction of "Party," a new feature designed to facilitate easier group play among friends.</p>

<p>In March 2023, we detailed Roblox's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/are-robloxs-new-ai-coding-and-art-tools-the-future-of-game-development/">early foray</a> into AI-powered game development tools, as revealed at the Game Developers Conference. The tools included a Code Assist beta for generating simple Lua functions from text descriptions, and a Material Generator for creating 2D surfaces with associated texture maps.</p>
<p>At the time, Roblox Studio head Stef Corazza described these as initial steps toward "democratizing" game creation with plans for AI systems that are now coming to fruition. The 2023 tools focused on discrete tasks like code snippets and 2D textures, laying the groundwork for the more comprehensive 3D foundational model announced at this year's Roblox Developer's Conference.</p>
<p>The upcoming AI tool could potentially streamline content creation on the platform, possibly accelerating Roblox's path toward its revenue goal. "We see a powerful future where Roblox experiences will have extensive generative AI capabilities to power real-time creation integrated with gameplay," Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/09/rdc-2024-robloxs-next-frontier">said</a>&nbsp; in a statement. "We’ll provide these capabilities in a resource-efficient way, so we can make them available to everyone on the platform."</p>

                <p>Did you know that there's a Devil May Cry 5 multiplayer game available right now? A tabletop multiplayer game, that is. Popular board game manufacturer Steamforged Games released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HW59Q8V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil May Cry: The Bloody Palace</a> a few years back. The board game originally carried a $115 list price, but it's now out of print and there's still some stock lingering at major retailers. Over at Amazon, you can grab the board game adaptation Capcom's demon-hunting series for $43. And if you prefer to go hunting for demons on your own, The Bloody Palace is playable solo, too.</p><p>Steamforged also has two board game core sets for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-World-Ancient-Forest/dp/B0CG9QTGD8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter World--Ancient Forest</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-World-Board-Wildspire/dp/B0CG9NQK7L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wildspire Waste</a>--as well as adaptations of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-The-Board-Game/dp/B0CHS43K99?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-2-Board-Game/dp/B07F3LJDCF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-Steamforged-Players-Gameplay/dp/B09F5L49B2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3</a>.

            <p>
Apple has unveiled the iPhone 16, claiming it'll be possible to play AAA games on all devices in the line-up - and not just on the pricier Pro models, as was the case last year.
</p>
<p>
Apple started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-triple-a-games-are-coming-to-iphone-15-pro-and-the-implications-are-mouthwatering">bigging up the iPhone's AAA gaming credentials</a> with 2023's iPhone 15 range, announcing the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> would all be playable exclusively on the ray tracing enabled iPhone 15 Pro.
</p>
<p>
12 months on and the iPhone 16 is here, offering what Apple claims to be a 30 percent CPU and 40 percent GPU boost over last year's model, courtesy of the new A18 chipset - designed to handle the company's computationally demanding on-device AI features, due later this year. And that extra oomph (which includes hardware-accelerated ray tracing on the iPhone 16) means AAA is no longer relegated to the iPhone Pro.

<p>
Apple says the base iPhone 16 is capable of playing the already released likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-directors-cut">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-assassins-creed-mirage-resident-evil-7-iphone">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-resident-evil-4-on-iphone-15-pro-targets-the-ps4-experience-but-doesnt-quite-hit-the-target">Resident Evil 4</a>, and Resident Evil: Village. Digital Foundry previously looked at all four games running on the iPhone 15 Pro, reporting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-full-fat-resident-evil-village-on-iphone-is-a-captivating-tech-demo-but-hard-to-recommend-playing">mixed results</a>, so it'll be interesting to see how this year's phones compare - even if claims of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-has-reportedly-flopped-on-ios-with-under-2000-sales">low AAA sales on iOS</a> mean we might not see an influx of new big-name titles anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
The iPhone 16 (which includes a new physical Camera Control button, and the previously Pro-only Action Button) starts at £799 for 128GB of storage and a 6.1-inch display. The 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus, meanwhile, costs £899 for the same storage, and it's only up from there. Over on the Pro side of things, pricing starts at £999 for the 6.3-inch/128GB model, or £1199 if you're after the 6.9-inch Pro Max. All models launch on 20th September, with pre-orders available from 13th September.
</p>
<p>
In related news, Apple has confirmed iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will both launch next Monday, 16th September. These new operating system upgrades introduce a new Game mode, designed to minimise background activity to improve frame rates - and there's promise of improved responsiveness for wireless game controllers and AirPods too.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-uk%E2%80%99s-gaming-expo-scene-might-suffer-another-loss-as-wasd-london-vanishes-online.976386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/uk-gaming-expo-london-wasd/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In May 2024, the United Kingdom’s Insomnia Gaming Festival was thrown into disarray following a spate of layoffs at Player1 Events, the organising body behind the iconic event. It came on the 25th anniversary of the expo, which had become the biggest gaming event in the UK, even after COVID-19 threatened to wipe them out forever.</p>



<p>Insomnia’s latest iteration should have taken place this past weekend, but it’s now generally assumed that the event has fallen into an irrevocable pit. In recent days, similar concerns have surfaced regarding WASD London, a smaller but still cherished gaming expo.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-is-wasd-london">Where is WASD London?</h2>



<p>It was recently noticed that WASD London’s website has disappeared – when you attempt to access it, you’re met with a message that it has expired. This could simply be an effort to rebrand, overhaul the site, or perform some serious front-end work, but it gets a little stranger when you probe deeper.</p>



<p>WASD London is hosted by Roucan Events, and when you try to jump over to <a href="https://www.roucan.co.uk/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the company’s website</a>, you’re met with a similar message of the site being expired. Furthermore, the social profiles for WASD London have stood mostly silent for just over eight weeks, which is uncharacteristic for the team.</p>



<p>I’ve frequented WASD London for years and can attest to how great of a showcase it is. It’s much more intimate and small-form and caters quite heavily to indie developers, but some big-name brands have made their way onto the show floor in recent years.</p>



<p>Looking back, I was one of the first people in the United Kingdom to play Dead Island 2 at WASD, and I got a hands-on experience with Lords of the Fallen weeks before it was released, to name a couple of great games. </p>



<p>We’ve reached out to representatives of Roucan Events to see if we can get a comment on the situation. Given that the Insomnia Gaming Festival has collapsed and EGX has merged with MCM to stay afloat, losing WASD would be another nail in the coffin for the UK gaming expo scene.</p>

That's a 22% price drop from its original $150 MSRP and the best price we've ever seen for an officially licensed 1TB Xbox expansion card. In fact, it's lower than the Amazon Prime Day deal, which was easily our top selling item for the entire event. The C50 is one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">best SSDs for the Xbox</a>, which isn't surprising since your options are pretty limited.</p><h2>WD Black C50 1TB Expansion Card for Xbox for $117</h2><div id="188326" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>WD C50 1TB Expansion Card For Xbox Series XS</h3></p></div><p>The WD Black C50 expansion card is essentially a 1TB NVME SSD encased in a specialized Xbox-compatible shell. Unlike the more complex PS5 SSD installation process, which involves opening up the PS5 to access the SSD slot, the WD expansion card simply plugs into its dedicated port on the back of the Xbox. This expansion card offers the same speed as the internal SSD, ensuring that you won't sacrifice performance or encounter extended load times as you might with a regular USB drive. With a 1TB expansion card, you can double the storage on your Xbox Series X console and triple the storage on your (white) Xbox Series S console.</p><p>If you're looking for an officially licensed storage solution (which we strongly recommend), your options are limited to either the WD or Seagate expansion cards, underscoring the importance of seizing a good deal when you find one.</p><p><em>Looking for more Xbox accessories?

<p>With so many players enjoying the fight against the Tyranids, a few bugs and glitches will undoubtedly crop up occasionally. A few already have, and we’ve covered some previously. But there’s a new one making the rounds. A black screen on startup in Space Marine 2 is plaguing the game for many, and it’s a troublemaker. But we have a few potential fixes!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-fix-a-black-screen-on-startup-in-space-marine-2">How to Fix a Black Screen on Startup in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>When you boot up the game, you might notice the intro video begins to lag until it inevitably stops working, and then you’re left with nothing but a black screen on startup in Space Marine 2. It’s a pain, considering how much you spent on the game, along with the insane hype levels surrounding the overall experience. Here are a few potential fixes that may help you move past the black screen bug:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Restart</strong>! If your game doesn’t work because it’s stuck on a black screen, but this isn’t usual, then attempt to restart your Steam, Epic Games, console, or PC. </li>



<li><strong>System Requirements</strong>! Check to ensure your computer meets <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/here-are-the-space-marine-2-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s minimum system requirements</a>. If you don’t, there’s a good chance the game is a bit too powerful for you to run on your current system. If that’s the case, upgrading components is the only surefire fix, but it’s costly and time-consuming.</li>



<li><strong>Corrupted</strong> <strong>files</strong>! Check your game for corrupted or missing files by verifying its integrity. You can do so by right-clicking Space Marine 2 in your Steam Library, selecting <strong>Properties</strong>, <strong>Installed Files</strong>, and <strong>Verify Integrity of Game Files</strong>.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Update</strong>! You may need to update the game or your graphics drivers. To do so, close out of the game and your launcher (Steam, Epic Games, etc.). Once you relaunch, if there’s an available update, it should automatically begin downloading and installing. Alternatively, verify the game’s files using the method mentioned above. For your graphics driver, check the associated app that comes pre-installed with your system, such as Nvidia GeForce, to check for a recent update.</li>



<li><strong>Reinstall</strong>! It’s certainly not the go-to fix, as redownloading the entirety of Space Marine 2 doesn’t sound entertaining (It’s a big game!), but sometimes it’s a last resort. Alternatively, you can reinstall Easy Anti-Cheat, which can resolve some launch issues, too.</li>
</ul>

However, while they are indeed Astro Bot related, they were originally made for the PSVR game Astro Bot Rescue Mission, rather than the new Astro Bot game that launched on PS5 last week. That said, the shirts simply mention Astro Bot, so they look like official merch for the new PS5 exclusive. Ripple Junction added these to Amazon in May of this year, likely to capitalize on the new game's popularity. Nevertheless, they all feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-face-of-playstation-and-the-technomagic-behind-astro-bot/1100-6526261/">PlayStation's newest platforming mascot</a>, and are an affordable way to add some official Astro Bot merch to your collection.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you haven't checked out Astro Bot on PS5 yet, you probably should.

			<p>Ubisoft Stock Prices have dropped another 7% as shareholders are uncertain about the company's future and worry that it isn't performing well enough. This year, several major Ubisoft releases have been released on rocky ground. The most recent game to be published by Ubisoft is Star Wars Outlaws. While it was well-reviewed by critics on Metacritic, it wasn't as well-received by Star Wars fans.&nbsp; With the release of Star Wars Outlaws, shares fell to a new 10-year low, and now the shares have fallen a further 7%, which isn't spelling out anything good for Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The stock price fall happened after a request from a "significant minority shareholder" at the company pressured Ubisoft into making the company go private or use the French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and begin a sale process.</p>
<p>In addition to the demand to make Ubisoft go private, the <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor has also requested</a> that the current management be replaced by a new CEO who will "optimize the cost and studio structure for a more agile and competitive company as Ubisoft should be."</p>
<p>Even though Ubisoft has launched a couple of great games in recent years, such as Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, it, unfortunately, doesn't come close to the negativity and player reviews for their more recent games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. In addition to the falling Ubisoft stock prices, XDefiant is now at risk of losing post-launch support, as player numbers have continued to fall, a game that previously contributed to the financial success of Ubisoft.</p>
<p>However, if the player count doesn't increase by season 3 of XDefiant, the game will lose the needed post-launch support that makes it more playable for those who are still dedicating time to it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares are worth 13.67 euros, roughly $15.09. In total, Ubisoft shares have decreased by 7.13% today alone, reaching a low of 13.31 euros, which is $14.69.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In their open letter, shareholders AJ Investments argue that Ubisoft is an undervalued company whose stock prices should be worth 40-45 euros per share. Unfortunately, Ubisoft is not coming close to hitting the mark. AJ Investments suggests they go private "with Tencent as a significant partner and shareholder to progress the company." To accompany that statement, they also want Ubisoft to "implement a comprehensive cost reduction and optimize staffing levels to be more comparable with industry leaders."</p>
<p>If Ubisoft takes note of its words and follows through on its actions, the industry can expect to see more layoffs, all to benefit shareholders.</p>

		<p>ZzzzzZzzzzz. That's me, the guy who was standing in a wedding this weekend, which means he was part of late night events on both Saturday and Sunday. I'm happy for one of my oldest friends, but it's one of those days where you wake up and go "god, I can't wait to go back to sleep tonight." (Related, this is also how I felt when the Bears, showing off their flashy new QB, had scored basically zero points at halftime. <em>Pain.</em>) But we've got another busy week at Remap, which has already kicked off as you read this—Remap Hotline is already in podcast feeds.</p><p>-pk, who is excited his deluxe <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> disc is coming in the mail today</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>We published the latest edition of Remap Hotline, where we start off by considering Rob's enormous slate of devices, and whether it's time for him to get another one. But in all seriousness, it's a lot of discussion about the role different devices play in our lives, and how it's frustrating when you can't make one thing work for everything. We answer a lot more than that, too.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>After talking over what's expected to be the announcement of a PlayStation 5 Pro, we'll record another episode of HOA. We've gotten really behind on reader questions, so we're going to make that the focus, but, uh, I recently discovered my front door frame was falling apart, so...yeah. Doors! You'll hear that podcast next week. In the afternoon, we'll squad up as a trio to check out <em>Space Marine 2</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> Because of our GeForce Now streams, we're moving Remap Radio recording to Wednesday. So, we'll get that in the bag. There's plenty of games we didn't end up having time for last week.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>The wheel must turn, and it falls on us to turn it.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>We'll publish Remap Radio, and most likely, another letter series between Rob and I. We're trying to make these something for every Friday. Next week, I think, we'll do our next Nextlander x Remap team up, too. <br></li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/wow-war-within-review-expansion-is-it-good-1851643832<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> has a lot to live up to. The first in a trilogy of expansions Blizzard has dubbed The Worldsoul Saga and the followup to the stellar previous expansion in <em>Dragonflight</em>, it’s easy to imagine it crumbling under lofty expectations. Luckily, however, <em>The War Within</em> builds wonderfully on the best aspects of its predecessors while adding worthwhile new ways to play, even if it plays it a bit safe while building the foundation of what is billed as the biggest story in the game’s twenty-year history. </p><p><em>The War Within</em> doesn’t mess around in its opening moments. Following a warning from the soul of the planet Azeroth herself, we find ourselves in imminent conflict with the menacing void known as Xal’atath. This harbinger of the void is puppeteering various factions throughout Khaz Algar, the expansion’s new continent. Like the best <em>WoW</em> villains, Xal’atath shows up in each zone of the expansion, making her feel dangerous as she schemes and manipulates vulnerable minds to achieve her dark aspirations.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-recommend-id="image://dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-recommend-id="image://dc60d40a98fd5074fa874d615e3cb0dd" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An armored Earthen, a dwarf who appears carved out of rock, stands proudly in a city environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I love how <em>The War Within</em> succeeds in introducing entirely new factions, fleshing them out, and tying them to the sprawling established lore in very cool ways. The first group we meet are the Titan-forged proto-dwarves known as the Earthen. Protectors of The Isle of Dorn, on which we’ve disastrously crashed, the Earthen become our central allies throughout the expansion. Because they follow ancient edicts, we outsiders aren’t exactly welcome, but out of necessity, we have to wedge our way into their strict society. Our interference causes many Earthen to struggle between adhering to the ancient edicts they are programmed to follow and adapting and embracing the potential new allies who have crash-landed on their doorstep. From there, we travel underground, where the rest of the expansion resides.<br></p><p>Khaz Algar is expertly crafted, and something unlike Blizzard has created before. Sure, <em>World of Warcraft</em> has had underground zones in the past, but nothing as vast and as interesting as what’s been created for <em>The War Within</em>. The Isle of Dorn and the zones beneath feel like a cohesive place that exists naturally, rather than a handful of disparate biomes that happen to border one another. And with the return of <em>Dragonflight</em>’s excellent Dragonriding mechanic, now known as Skyriding, which has been expanded to just about everywhere in the game, you can explore these new zones (as well as familiar ones) in the best way possible. It’s a blast navigating <em>The War Within</em>’s areas on dragonback, or whichever flying mount you’d like, soaring down the cavern in the center of the Earthen city of Dornogal down to the Ringing Deeps, taking a sharp left into the radiant Hallowfall next door, and continuing into the depths of Azj-Kahet where the creepy crawly Nerubians reside.</p><figure id="" data-id="4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-recommend-id="image://4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-recommend-id="image://4310056be9342af8d8622bd8463f57a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The region of Hallowfall, with a massive glowing crystal hanging down from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>My favorite of these zones is the hauntingly beautiful Hallowfall, which, despite being deep below the surface, is unexpectedly open and bright. A mysterious crystal protrudes from its ceiling, illuminating the area like a surrogate sun. Despite being deep below the surface, Hallowfall is unexpectedly open and bright. Here, we meet the Arathi, a faction making its debut in <em>The War Within</em>. While they come from the other side of the globe, they share ties to the humans and elves from our hemisphere of Azeroth. Stranded for years after being teleported to Hallowfall, the Arathi are in a constant struggle to keep their holy fires burning and, in so doing, to keep the insect-like Nerubian invaders from even deeper below at bay. On top of that, the large shining shard in the sky keeps shifting to an ominous void-y glow, empowering the evil hordes flooding from the darkness. With its impeccable art direction, fascinating story, and lore implications, Hallowfall is instantly iconic and easily my favorite zone Blizzard has created in years.<br></p><p><em>The War Within</em>’s story expands the existing <em>Warcraft </em>mythos in meaningful ways, and there’s plenty to look forward to regarding long-running storylines with characters like Anduin Wrynn and Magi Bronzebeard. Unfortunately, without getting into specifics, some of the more powerful story beats often pull their punches, defanging the situations in which characters find themselves. I’d be much more invested in the coming patches and the next expansion if some of these moments didn’t cheapen the threat Xal’atath truly poses to our heroes throughout the mainline quests.<br></p><p><em>The War Within</em>’s main narrative questline can be breezed through much faster than those in previous expansions, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t plenty to do and see. Each zone only has about three central questlines that get to the meat of <em>The War Within</em>, but the abundance of side quests adds wonderful detail to the outlines the main story lays down. Some of the most interesting quests and storylines are found off the beaten path, and I’m happy I took the time to play through them. For instance, after being saved by a new race called the Harronir that seems to be the missing link between Night Elves and Dark Trolls, you’ll be rewarded with a cool series of quests that involve corrupting yourself with blood from an Old God to fight Eldritch horror hallucinations, but only if you make an effort to seek them out. Much of the expansion’s best stuff is in its side content, and it shouldn’t be skipped if you’re a sucker for some of that sweet, sweet lore.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-recommend-id="image://427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-recommend-id="image://427edf3acb8f9f5d3ef98f2114561d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu of Hero Talents is pictured, with a skill tree called Elune's Chosen and one called Keeper of the Grove displayed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of the story, <em>The War Within</em> introduces a handful of great new features. First, in lieu of expanding the existing talent trees that were re-established in <em>Dragonflight</em>, it brings us Hero Talents. Taking inspiration from the class artifact weapons from <em>Legion</em>, Hero Talents provide you with new choices about how to play your character, which pays off in spades in enhancing and realizing class identity. Each class has a handful of Hero Talent paths to choose from, with two accessible paths available for each specialization. While leveling my Protection Paladin, I initially took on the talents of the Lightsmith, allowing me to imbue my weapon and armor with the power of the holy light while spreading those benefits to my allies. Alternatively, I could choose the Templar route, giving me access to more holy hammers to drop from the sky to melt my foes. Either way, I feel like I’m playing a different type of Protection Paladin than ever before and both ooze flavor.<br></p><p>While it officially rolled into the game earlier this year, <em>The War Within</em> is the first expansion in which Follower Dungeons are available throughout the leveling experience. Instead of having to wait in a dungeon queue or having to deal with random people who you may not vibe with, Follower Dungeons team you up with NPCs to fill the missing roles in your party and let you play through a given dungeon at your own pace. Conceptually, it’s a wonderful addition to the game, especially for new players still learning the ropes and their roles in a group. Even someone like myself, who has hundreds of hours in the game, finds it to be a very useful tool to ease myself into learning how to tank without the social pressures of impatient teammates.<br></p><p>Also leaning into solo and small group play is a new activity called Delves. Reworking the blueprint of Torghast, a roguelike tower from back in Shadowlands, Delves have so far fixed my biggest gripes of its previous iteration, which were often time-consuming when running alone and frustratingly mandatory to progress in collecting gear in the end game. Instead, Delves offer a succinct optional activity that doesn’t eat up a significant chunk of time to complete but are still a viable way to collect powerful loot.<br></p><p>Delves can be found in a variety of locations, with each serving a handful of objectives that alternate upon each entry, giving some much-needed variety to what something like Torghast once offered. In this first season of Delves, you’re joined by <em>WoW</em>’s ambitious and prolific adventurer, Brann Bronzebeard. Brann levels up throughout Delve runs and can be equipped with various abilities to support your playstyle best. I haven’t really had any issues with Brann pulling his weight in our brief partnership, although I also haven’t had much of a problem completing Delves to begin with. Only three levels of difficulty were available at the time of this review, none of which were all that hard to work through. At worst Delves have been a little boring, but I see the promise of the concept, and expect them to pick up when I can grind my way up the difficulty ladder when they’re implemented.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-recommend-id="image://0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-recommend-id="image://0ef12ff645349eba0e2342dd6b189bbf" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Warbands screen shows four World of Warcraft characters gathered around a campfire, each with their names and levels displayed above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, Warbands are a new feature with <em>The War Within</em>, but they’re a little more nebulous of a concept than Delves and Hero Talents. However, they are no less important and exciting for the long-term health of <em>World of Warcraft</em>. Warbands is Blizzard’s way of tearing down walls between the characters you have on your account. Combined with a reworked character select screen, Warbands let you share things like bank space, collected gear transmogs, currency, achievements, quest progression, and faction reputation across all of your characters. No more having to grind the same content again and again on alts if you don’t want to. It was liberating switching to my Mage after completing <em>The War Within</em>’s main story and skipping it entirely, not having to relive those exact moments yet again a few short hours after experiencing them and letting me level in whatever way I see fit. While it’s certainly not the flashiest thing Blizzard has put in the game, I’m thankful for the huge quality-of-life improvements Warbands have already afforded me.<br></p><p>I can confidently say <em>WoW</em> is back. Well, it was back in <em>Dragonflight</em>, but it’s extra back now. Not only does <em>The War Within</em> make the player experience better with great additions like Warbands and Follower Dungeons, but it also demonstrates that Blizzard isn’t afraid to keep refining good ideas like Hero Talents or reworking those that may have failed previously and molded them into nuggets of fun and flavor like Delves. If this is just the start of what to expect with <em>Warcraft</em> in the era of The Worldsoul Saga, then I’m eager to stick around and see where these new adventures on Azeroth take us next.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The basic white suit version will be included in the base game. The chef outfit variant will be available free to KFC rewards members. And finally, if you want to unlock and use the mech suit variant of Colonel Sanders (a real man who once walked this Earth), you’ll need 250 KFC reward points. That’s about $25 worth of chicken.</p><p>I’d make a joke at this point about how Sanders is spinning in his grave, but the dude’s likely used to it by now.

                <p>One of Activision's newest development teams, Elsewhere Entertainment, is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activision_begin-a-journey-elsewhere-were-looking-activity-7238893228387635200-C8Dw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continuing to hire</a> and seems to be expanding to a new region, suggesting the team's mysterious project may be ramping up.</p><p>Elsewhere is making an "all-new franchise" that is a "narrative-based IP," but there continue to be no other details available as of yet. But now, Elsewhere is hiring for jobs based in Malmo, Sweden, which is noteworthy because previously the studio was only known to have a presence in Warsaw, Poland.</p><p>Malmo is also home to Just Cause studio Avalanche and Star Wars Outlaws developer Massive. Hitman developer IO Interactive also has an office in the Swedish city.</p><p>Elsewhere is <a href="https://careers.activision.com/Elsewhere?utm_source=Elsewhere&amp;utm_medium=LinkedIn&amp;utm_campaign=ElsewhereEntertainmentCTA&amp;utm_id=Elsewhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actively hiring</a> for a variety of roles currently across a number of disciplines, though the jobs ads don't give much away. It sounds like it's early days for this new Activision game, and there is no word yet on a release window or platforms, including whether or not it will be exclusive on console to Xbox given Activision's stance as a Microsoft-owned company.</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-announces-new-studio-making-all-new-franchise/1100-6523503/" data-ref-id="1100-6523503">reported previously</a>, GameSpot understands Elsewhere's first game will not be a new Call of Duty project and that the team has been working quietly on the game for some time.</p><p>Activision investing in a non-sequel or franchise extension is a big move, as the company has in recent years <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">tripled down on Call of Duty.</a> Elsewhere is staffed by people who worked on The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, The Division, and Far Cry.</p><p>Activision has expanded beyond established franchises before, but it hasn't published a new, original IP since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice in 2019. Prior to that, Activision published Bungie's Destiny series before Bungie took the franchise back and split off from Activision (and was later acquired by Sony).</p><p>Elsewhere is Activision's second studio in Poland, joining the Infinity Ward team in Krakow. Resources from Activision's US teams are working with Elsewhere.</p><p>As for the Call of Duty series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is coming this October. Its second weekend of public beta testing just wrapped up, giving fans a first taste of the multiplayer shooter.</p>
