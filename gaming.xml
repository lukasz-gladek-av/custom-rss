<p>It looks... okay?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Denis Dyack, the former president of Silicon Knights and director of games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/blood_omen_legacy_of_kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a>, has revealed the latest look at <strong>Deadhaus Sonata</strong>, a new 'spiritual successor' to Blood Omen.</p>
<p>Originally announced back in 2018, there are no target platforms at the moment, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142050/Deadhaus_Sonata/">Steam</a> page is now live with more information on its Early Access release. Dyack has previously stated that Deadhaus Sonata will be coming to consoles, but given the sheer amount of time it's been in the works, we can't say for certain if this includes the Switch or Switch 2.</p>
<p>Looking at the gameplay footage, it looks... okay? It's hard to really parse exactly what's going on. There's a lot of hack and slash action being showcased, but there's quite a busy UI to go along with it, and we're not quite sure how everything functions. Early descriptions state that tarot cards can be used to customise your build, while loot is tied to your actions and performance, rather than being completely random.</p>
<p>Still, it's nice to be shown gameplay at all in this day and age, and we're certain Dyack will reveal more in the coming months.</p>
<p>Here's the official Steam description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Step into Malorum, a dark and crumbling world where the lines between life and death no longer hold. Deadhaus Sonata invites you to embrace the undead, master supernatural powers, and carve your place within a realm shaped by ancient forces, political intrigue, and the choices of its players. Play alone or join up to six players in cooperative play as you face the living and uncover the secrets that shape this fallen realm.</p>
</blockquote>

Asus <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/863000/asus-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-5060-ti-supply-rumors">told Hardware Unboxed earlier this week</a> that it was winding down production of its RTX 5070 Ti, but the PC maker is now walking back that claim and blaming “incomplete information” from its own Asus PR representatives.</p><p>“The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB have not been discontinued or designated as end-of-life (EOL),” says an <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/statements/asus-rtx-5070ti-5060ti-statement/">Asus statement</a>. “Asus has no plans to stop selling these models.”</p><p>That’s quite the opposite of what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/863000/asus-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-5060-ti-supply-rumors">Asus told Hardware Unboxed</a>, with the YouTube channel reporting that Asus “explicitly told us this model is currently facing a supply shortage and, as such, they have placed the model into end-of-life status.”</p><div><p>Here’s the full timeline, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE">from Hardware Unboxed</a>, of how this mess unfolded:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>• We request RTX 5070 Ti samples from Asus (and other partners)<br>• An Asus PR rep looks into it, comes back and says they cannot provide 5070 Tis due to supply constraints, saying their models are “end of life.”<br>• We ask Asus to clarify whether the RTX 5070 Ti is end of life. They confirm it’s end of life.<br>• We reach out to retailers to see whether they can purchase RTX 5070 Ti stock for their stores, to fact check Asus’ claims. They say there is no supply.<br>• Given we have received an on the record statement from Asus and confirmed the supply constraints with retailers, we publish a video with this information.<br>• Nvidia says all GeForce SKUs are being shipped.<br>• Asus reaches out to clarify that Nvidia told Asus that the RTX 5070 Ti is not end of life, but that Asus are “streamlining some models.”<br>• We publish that statement.<br>• Asus reaches out again to provide another statement (the third statement we’ve received from Asus), now saying the 5070 Ti is not discontinued or end of life. This directly contradicts the original statement.<br>• We immediately request RTX 5070 Ti samples now that the cards are not discontinued or end of life. We haven’t heard back yet.</p></blockquote></div><p>A global shortage of conventional DRAM and NAND is putting the pressure on RAM and GPU prices, and we’re starting to see a lack of GPU stock or higher pricing. Asus blames fluctuations in supply for both the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5060 Ti 16GB models due to the ongoing memory supply constraints that have affected production output. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement,” says Asus.</p><p>Nvidia told us yesterday that it was still producing RTX 5070 Ti GPUs and continues “to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.” Just how many RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models will be available in the future is anyone’s guess. Perhaps they’ll be as limited in the real world as Nvidia’s own Founders Edition models, which are very rarely ever in stock.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/863297/asus-pr-mess-rtx-5070-ti-end-of-life-statements-memory-shortages]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Amazon’s colonial fantasy MMO <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-world">New World</a> (latterly rebranded New World: Aeternum) is no longer available for purchase as of yesterday, and will be taken offline for good from 31st January 2027, the publishers have announced. The news follows the release of the game’s final major update back in October, amid <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-wont-be-getting-any-more-new-additions-following-mass-layoffs-at-amazon">mass layoffs at Amazon</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crucible-review">the similarly ill-fated Crucible</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-cancel-breakaway">Breakaway</a>, New World was once a key plank of Amazon’s push to become a big mover in the games industry - amplifying its existing success as a provider of software and web services, and luring yet more innocent souls into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/05/way-past-its-prime-how-did-amazon-get-so-rubbish">the toxic swamp</a> of the Amazon Prime subscription business. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-game-studios-announce-three-games">Announced in 2016</a>, it underwent several delays amid reports of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/report-shares-more-tales-of-disfunction-at-amazon-game-studios">corporate dysfunction in Amazon's embryonic studio empire</a>, eventually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazons-mmo-new-world-is-out-now-but-the-servers-are-struggling">launching out of beta in 2021</a>, with a storyline conclusion landing in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-will-get-its-storyline-conclusion-in-its-next-update">2022</a>.</p>
<p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-world-review-in-progress">mildly enthused by New World at launch</a>, calling the game “a fresh, swashbuckling MMO that's still very grindy early on”. Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-worlds-crafting-is-great-because-i-had-no-choice-but-to-use-it">liked the emphasis on crafting</a>. It had over 700,000 players on Steam on release day. But then it proceeded to <a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/news/new-world-daily-active-players-down-more-than-90-on-steam-from-record-high-in-september-2000124162">lose over 90% of its players in a matter of months</a>.</p>
<p>I never played New World myself, mostly because I try to avoid anything associated with Amazon, but it never struck me as particularly fascinating from afar – familiar combat and quest mechanics with some convoluted magic settler politics. Still, I’m sorry for any New World developers who’ve lost their jobs as a result of this latest “sunsetting”. In general, I'll take a lacklustre MMO over Jeff Bezos's desire to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-unveils-lunar-lander-mission/story?id=62941981">move humans into giant, Amazon-run space stations</a>.</p><p>The game’s live service will continue to operate before the servers are pulled, with recurring world bosses and bonus weeks. The devs will also keep an eye out for bugs and performance issues. But there will be no more content additions or server merges. You’ll be able to buy in-game currencies such as Marks of Fortune until July 20, 2026 – beware that Amazon are not offering refunds for such purchases.</p>
<p>“We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion,” the devs <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/the-future-of-new-world-aeternum-what-to-expect">write on their official site</a>. “We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we’re honored that we were able to share so much with the community."</p>
<p>Any New World veterans reading? I’d like to read some reminiscing.</p>

            <p>I be a poor journo. Newly come from the official Ubisoft music YouTube channel. I spend my life in jeopardy.
Of a publisher suddenly turning around and saying that a sudden mass reupload of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Black Flag</a>'s sea shanties was in fact just a case of behind-the-scenes issues, rather than another harbinger of a remake announcement.</p>
<p>Tp be fair, it did follow many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">reports about the badly kept secret that is the Black Flag remake</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">PEGI rating</a> that sure looks like it's for such a game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-says-black-flag-music-reupload-was-due-to-technical-issues/">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft have popped their head above deck on their music channel's community page in the hours since they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-sea-shanty-siren-song-grows-even-more-deafening-as-ubisoft-reupload-a-bunch-of-sailing-tunes">suddenly uploaded 18 Black Flag sea shanties in a one 24 hour window</a>.</p>
<p>"Hi there music lovers," wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx_qiROkA8vcnQk_a-1BH_gW4gTLnDetS0">Ubi's instrument-wielders</a>. "We encountered some technical issues with a few of our videos, which we had to reupload. Apologies for the trouble, and hope you enjoy the music." It's a statement which neatly dances around mentioning Black Flag by name or getting into the specifics of why the technical gremlins affecting these specific decade or so old tracks have seemingly been discovered now of all times, with that heavily-reported remake looking very much to be on its way to port.</p>
<p>To be fair, maybe someone at Ubisoft just woke up one day really wanting to blast 17th century maritime ditties for the first time in ages and found something was getting in their way.</p>
<p>The Black Flag remake, or Resynced if the PEGI rating has its name correct, is reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">set to sail this March</a>. Until then, all we can do is sit on the beach and keep our telescopes trained for sails on the horizon.</p>

To provide some clarity, I reached out to Kuits specialist employment solicitor, Jake McManus, who has broken the mechanism down for our readers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Interim relief is rarely sought and even more rarely granted, primarily because it is only available in very limited circumstances, including where an employee alleges to be dismissed due to trade union activity or for whistleblowing," McManus told Game Developer.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not available to employees who are otherwise dismissed unfairly or in discrimination cases, both of which make up the vast majority of claims brought in the Employment Tribunal. Put simply, the circumstances in which an application for interim relief may be available just do not occur very often. Applications for interim relief must also be made within 7 days of the dismissal, so many employees will be out of time before they even consider whether an application can or should be made."&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;An unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself&quot;">"An unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself"</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-is-evaluating-how-its-game-tech-may-be-applied-to-physical-ai-and-robotics-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Krafton is evaluating how its game tech may be applied to 'physical AI and robotics'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fact that interim relief can only be sought in select circumstances, including instances of alleged union busting, explains why the fired Rockstar workers were able to seek it out. Why, though, is the bar for success during an interim relief hearing higher than the bar for a positive outcome at a full hearing?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply put: a positive outcome for employees seeking interim relief could be incredibly costly for employers, especially in a climate where a backlog of tribunals means some cases could take years to reach a resolution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If successful, a dismissed employee can be reinstated or remain on full pay until their unfair dismissal claim is dealt with. Given the current backlog in the Tribunal system we could be talking years: an unfair dismissal claim issued today is unlikely to reach a final hearing until 2027 or 2028," added McManus.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is therefore a very powerful weapon in an employee's armoury and can be very costly for an employer. What is more, if the employee goes on to lose their unfair dismissal claim then there is no obligation to reimburse the employer for any pay. Interim relief is ultimately a draconian measure for Tribunals to deploy and that is why it is rarely granted."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-sony-nintendo-provide-joint-update-on-player-safety-commitment" target="_self" data-discover="true">Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo provide joint update on player safety commitment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing that threshold for success, McManus noted that interim relief will only be granted when a tribunal feels a claimant is "likely" to demonstrate the principal reason for their dismissal is one of the "very limited circumstances" detailed above—i.e. union busting or whistleblowing. That means employees must establish they have a "pretty good chance of success" when seeking interim relief as opposed to simply a "reasonable prospect of success."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, McManus explained an unsuccessful interim relief application does not mean an unfair dismissal claim is doomed to fail—though it would certainly improve its chances of success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If the employee is successful with their application for interim relief then it is likely that they will be successful with the claim itself," he added. "It also signals to the parties that the claimants have a strong case, and given that the employer is affected financially by the decision to grant interim relief, it can encourage settlement. However, an unsuccessful application is not fatal for the unfair dismissal claim itself."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of the interim relief tribunal between the ousted Rockstar workers and their former employer, McManus said the judge overseeing proceedings was simply unconvinced at this stage that Rockstar's decision to dismiss those employees was "most likely" due to trade union activity. As we have already established, though, a positive outcome for employees at this point in the process is rare, and McManus said the ruling doesn't mean the judge believed the dismissals were fair or that fair process was followed.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>When provocative horror game Horses was banned from sale on Steam and the Epic Game Store late last year, it nearly led to the closure of acclaimed Italian studio Santa Ragione - denied, as it was, access to some of the world's largest paying game audiences. But amid the panicked delistings there was another company determined to sell Horses and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/following-controversial-bans-from-steam-and-epic-santa-ragiones-horses-has-sold-18k-copies-and-repaid-debts">throw Santa Ragione a lifeline</a>: Poland-based online store GOG.</p>
<p>It was a bold stand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">a year of panicked delistings and removals of games deemed to contain adult content</a> - action seemingly pushed and enforced by powerful payment providers MasterCard and Visa. This censorious approach sought to outlaw grotty pornographic games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/queer-developers-speak-out-as-adult-games-remain-in-limbo-following-payment-processor-showdown-at-steam-and-itchio">but it caught all kinds of well-meaning games in its net</a>, including games like Horses. GOG would not only stand up to this action by selling Horses but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-offers-13-free-nsfw-games-as-it-launches-anti-censorship-campaign-freedomtobuygames">it launched an anti-censorship movement in response</a>.</p>

<p>GOG managing director Maciej Gołębiewski told me, reflecting on the decision in an interview, that it was a "matter of freedom" for him. "We as a company are always ready to take a stand on values - our own and also what we believe are the right values for the industry," he said. "We believe in creative freedom, because once a company, through their own terms of service, decides what's good and what's not good - what's acceptable; what can be sold and what cannot be sold - it's a slippery slope from that point onward.</p><p>"We obviously are a business and we do assess our risks," he added, "because we don't want to hurt the business, we don't want to hurt the employees, and we don't want to hurt the players by doing so. So we are also careful. But with Horses... We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling. The game is obviously controversial but there's nothing there that should deem it couldn't be sold.</p>
<p>"That's the role of regulators and governments to decide - democratic governments - what's legal and what's not legal, not companies that hold - Visa and MasterCard together - probably 90-something-percent of the market, then just decide whether something can be sold or not. For me it's a matter of freedom."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We are a curated storefront so we are actually playing the games that we are selling"</em></blockquote>
<p>Michał Kiciński - the new owner of GOG - put it more succinctly when he said to me: "Curation is the privilege and prerogative of each platform. The difference here with Horses is that we've played the game and we thought it was very cool."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">GOG became an independent and private company at the end of December</a>, meaning it's no longer a part of Polish superstar game-maker CD Projekt, which GOG had been for its entire 17-year (more like 18 if you count internal development) history. Michał Kiciński owns the company now. Coincidentally, he was one of the people who originally launched GOG, and he was one of the founders of CD Projekt, so he knows the businesses well. Kiciński left CD Projekt in 2012 in need of a break but remained - and remains - a major shareholder.</p><p>This newfound independence and autonomy allows GOG to be bolder; Kiciński has already said "I'm not afraid of risk" in relation to the company's future. But beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-eyes-indie-game-publishing-something-it-couldnt-do-under-cd-projekt-red">a possible move into indie game publishing</a> there aren't plans to change what GOG does and what people like it for. Primarily the business is built on reviving classic games, both old and modern, and preserving them for years to come. It's also eternally committed to offering games without any kind of DRM.</p>

<p>But GOG does also sell newer games - and big games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. However, it does this selectively - a form of curation it believes is another notable difference in today's overcrowded gaming world.</p>
<p>As Gołębiewski explained: "The area of specialisation for GOG is the classics and the modern classics, where we want to provide a superior experience to any other store or a platform out there. That's why [we have] the GOG Preservation Program and why we are working hard on the first-party software to make sure that games are playable and stay playable 20, 30 years from now. Apart from that, obviously we welcome any good game onto the platform, because we want our users to have as rich a catalogue as possible, with quality being the limiting factor."</p>
<p>"This is very important," Kiciński said, continuing the thought, "because the difference - the big difference - between Steam and GOG, for example, is that GOG is a very curated platform. Playability and fun-factor are the most important for us, no matter if the game is an old classic, new classic, or indie game with great fun-factor. That's the specialty of GOG: to deliver games with the great fun-factor and playability despite the age."</p><p>It's still early days in GOG's independent new era, and it's worth pointing out that while GOG is technically a competitor to Steam, Kiciński's business has around two percent of the market, he said, while Steam has something like 80 percent, so there's an enormous difference in size. But as Kiciński pointed out, "It's super difficult to defend such a big market share," and perhaps as players seek alternatives to Steam's overloaded catalogue, a few percentage points might creep elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Capcom's upcoming Resident Evil Requiem will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date", complete with ... (checks notes) ... a cleaning zombie.</p>
<p>This is coming from the game's director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>.</p>

<p>Nakanishi was talking during last night's Resident Evil broadcast, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Nakanishi again affirmed Leon - who is still a DSO agent after the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 6</a> - is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">not a good choice for horror in the traditional sense</a>, because he isn't someone to flinch at simple things. "It may be a survival horror game, but I think we've made an experience that suits Leon," the director said, noting these sections will be more similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Oh, and Requiem will "likely" push poor Leon to his limit, as if the poor chap hasn't already been through enough.</p><p>Nakanishi believes switching between Requiem's two leads will give players a "huge sense of catharsis" when the game is released next month. But, away from these two, last night's broadcast also gave us a look at Requiem's zombie enemies. These chaps will retain characteristics from when they were alive. What this means is in practice is one zombie who was a custodian before they were turned will still be found cleaning the building they're in. Personally, I would have hoped one benefit of becoming a zombie would be I would no longer have to scrub my oven and such, but, alas, this is not the case for Requiem's ghoulish foes.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February.</p>
<p>For more, our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>. So, that bodes well!</p>

<p>Those who have played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> know just how big of a game it really is. <a href="https://hundred-line.com/news/?id=69524">According to the publisher</a>, however, the release was actually two games in one, and that's supposedly how it's going to be marketed from now on.</p>
<p>Confused? Yeah don't worry, it's understandable. Effectively, once you complete 100 in-game days, you roll the credits and then commence 'New Game +' (although the title menu does, in fact, display 'The Hundred Line 2'), during which you make key decisions to splinter the narrative into dozens of potential branches.</p>
<p>So, the first 100 days is 'The Hundred Line', while the following narrative is 'The Hundred Line 2'. So there you go: it's now officially two games in one! So the title that launched last year is now being described as a 'value 1 &amp; 2 pack'.</p>
<p>To mark the occasion, a new trailer has been released (above) to highlight the events that take place in the 'sequel', while a brand new piece of key art has been shared to demonstrate the two distinct narratives. Pardon the poor quality, it's the best we could find from an official source.</p>
<figure data-uuid="748e0723798c0"><a title="Hundred Line 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/748e0723798c0/hundred-line-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Aniplex</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, it's been confirmed that an official soundtrack is launching on all major streaming services on <strong>17th January 2026</strong>. A physical soundtrack will also be made available in April to mark the game's first anniversary. In Japan, meanwhile, a <a href="https://online.aniplex.co.jp/itemoazLMQxE.html">new special edition release</a> of the game will be made available from April, featuring brand new artwork to acknowledge the 'sequel'.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I think we all <em>want</em> it to be true that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>’ infamously limp <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">PC performance</a> can be blamed upon, as was reported yesterday, an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-might-stand-to-be-improved-by-limiting-dlc-checks-but-thats-not-necessarily-a-silver-bullet">overzealous DLC checking process</a> gumming up what might overwise be a perfectly fine-running beastfight game. Partly because it just sounds funny. Willing but frustrated graphics elves running about, harangued to distraction by a hairstyle add-on overseer nagging for licenses, like a Daily Telegraph reader demanding to know why you aren’t wearing a poppy on November 3rd.</p>
<p>The best part? All evidence suggests it genuinely is true – albeit only to varying degrees, and in the case of my own testing, nowhere near as drastically as in the originally discovered case.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To recap, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">redditor de_Tylmarande</a> found that framerates around MHW’s base camp hubs more than tripled after tricking MHW into thinking he had all the game’s cosmetic DLCs – 190 in total, and costing over £460 in the King’s sterling – installed. Separately, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798">a mod limiting the checks</a> was also widely found to improve performance in those hubs, especially around the desks where a DLC-hocking cat hangs out. Capcom themselves then <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475">announced</a>, with suspicious timing, an upcoming patch containing performance improvements.</p>
<p>I wanted to see what happens when you legitimately do have the full cosmetic catalogue in your account, so fired up the RPS Test Rig and took some framerate recordings on a 'clean' install, free of add-ons. I then went about dropping nearly half a grand on fluffy pendants and bird outfits, by which I mean I added them all through our Steam press account at the expense of nobody in particular.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Subsequent retests indicated, at best, FPS improvements that remain dependent on the hardware producing them. With the popular RTX 4060, running at 1080p/Ultra with some help from Quality DLSS, a pre-DLC average of 66fps around camp only rose to 67fps after the shopping spree. However, the much more powerful RTX 5080, at 4K/Ultra (also with DLSS Quality), got a more substantial rise of 67fps to 73fps. Still miles off a tripling, but enough to escape any likely margin of error.</p><p>Both GPUs also saw slight improvements to 0.1% framerates, which basically means their lowest framerates didn’t fall as low. Before DLC, the RTX 4060’s 0.1% value was 42fps, which climbed to 45fps afterwards. The RTX 5080’s low of 27fps also ticked up to 33fps. Since one of Monster Hunter Wilds’ biggest performance annoyances is its stuttering, even small gains like this can translate into visibly smoother running.</p>
<p>Since the bug appears location-based, worsening in severity the closer you get to that DLC vendor, I didn’t see any meaningful boosts to average framerates out in the field. As such, and in case this wasn’t apparent already, Rock Paper Shotgun Dot Com does not recommend the purchasing of nearly 200 trinkets in an attempt to make MHW go faster. Still, the base camp results do back up the theory that something is amiss; I’ll have another go after Capcom’s patch arrives on January 27th, and see if this most unusual of transactional bugs gets squished.</p>

<p>Hypixel Studios’ founder has confirmed that a new patch is coming with dinosaurs, changes to mining sounds, and more. </p>



<p>The founder had recently discussed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being unhappy with mining</a> in Hytale and asked for suggestions on how to make the process more satisfying, while outlining several other improvements coming to the game. It seems the first set of improvements to Hytale’s mining system should arrive tomorrow.  </p>

The patch will also include some fixes; however, details about them were not revealed. </p>

            <guid>1408018</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It didn't take long for <strong>Amazon</strong> to decide when <strong>New World</strong> would be taken offline. As you might remember, the gaming division of the giant corporation <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that no more content would be made for the game</a></strong> just three months ago, while also <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">quietly </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceling the in-development The Lord of the Rings MMO project</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-delisted-go-offline-january-2027-amazon-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that New World had been delisted from stores, making it unavailable for new purchases, and clarified the date the servers will go offline forever: <strong>January 31, 2027</strong>.</p>



<p>While that's over a year away, having a definitive shutdown date is a particularly sad occurrence for any MMO. Unlike regular games, MMOs are actual virtual worlds inhabited by thousands of players on each server, creating permanent communities and social structures such as guilds. For some players, losing access is a bit like losing connection to places and people you've come to appreciate. That's why communities often fight to keep them alive one way or another. </p>



<p>That sentiment is indeed very strong for New World, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was doing better with the latest updates released by the developers</a> and was actually trending upward in player counts - just not as much as Amazon desired. The game's community has discussed ways to keep the game alive; there's precedent for it, chiefly with <strong>City of Heroes</strong>, the superhero-themed MMORPG created by <strong>Cryptic Studios</strong> and later acquired by <strong>NCSoft</strong>. When NCSoft shut down the game in 2012, fans spun up a private server, and the server code leak in <strong>April 2019</strong> led to multiple private servers. One in particular, called <strong>Homecoming</strong>, eventually emerged above all others, and NCSoft granted Homecoming an official license to host the game in 2024.</p>



<p>That was about the best outcome New World fans could hope for. However, in a veritable twist, <strong>Alistair McFarlane</strong>, COO and Company Director at <strong>Facepunch</strong> (the British developer behind <strong>Rust</strong> and <strong>Garry's Mod</strong>), <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> a <strong>$25 million 'offer'</strong> to purchase the game from Amazon, adding that 'games should never die'. </p>



<p>Needless to say, having an actual professional game studio pick up the game would be far better. Amazon also demonstrated they are not actually averse to the idea; as part of their mass gaming layoffs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-acquires-march-of-giants-moba-from-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they sold the upcoming MOBA, <strong>March of Giants</strong>, to <strong>Ubisoft</strong></a>. The difference is that in that case, they sold the game alongside the development team based in Montréal, Canada, whereas most of the New World team is likely already gone. </p>



<p>This would make it hard for a game like New World to sustain itself over time. Unlike sandbox games like Rust or Garry's Mod, the MMO is mostly themepark-based, meaning it sustains itself on developer-made content rather than user-generated content. Even if it acquired the license, Facepunch <strong>would still have to build a small team to keep it going and add new content every once in a while</strong>.</p>



<p>We've reached out to Facepunch to ask whether McFarlane's offer was genuine in the first place and will update this story if and when they respond.</p>

<p>Hytale developers are back again with a new hotfix, this time addressing connectivity and stability issues. </p>



<p>Hypixel Studios’ new sandbox RPG seems to be off to a great start in early access, with even Riot Games, the studio that previously cancelled the game, congratulating them on the successful release. The developers are hard at work to constantly improve the game and have recently released a hotfix to address several concerns. </p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-january-15-hotfix-details">Hytale January 15 Hotfix Details</h2>



<p>As revealed on their <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-january-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog</a>, Hytale’s new hotfix addresses connectivity and stability issues. The game has now received general server stability and network improvements in the new update. After updating, the game switches to offline mode if authentication fails; it used to get stuck before. The last connectivity fix addressed the “invalid token” errors that appeared when the player’s system clock was slightly out of sync. </p>



<p>Regarding stability improvements, client performance has improved through optimization of background task scheduling.

            <title><![CDATA[MTG Fallout Secret Lair ‘Rad Superdrop’ Revealed and Coming Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mtg-fallout-secret-lair-rad-superdrop-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1408009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Magic: The Gathering is preparing to expand on the Fallout collaboration that was released in 2024 with an all-new Secret Lair drop. The Secret Lair website was recently updated with a new banner that reveals the crossover as coming soon, but instead of focusing on <strong>the games</strong>, the ‘Rad Superdrop’ will be linked wholeheartedly to the Fallout television series.</p>



<p>Many of the cards were revealed early on, uncovering a stack of premium prints, including Lucy MacLean, The Ghoul, Maximus, the Platinum Chip, and Mindcrank, which was the first card to be unveiled. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-s-magic-secret-lair-range-coming-soon">Fallout’s Magic Secret Lair Range Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The Secret Lair range, which sits under the Magic banner, has featured some of the most beloved franchises in gaming and pop culture. The likes of The Last of Us, Uncharted, Avatar, God of War, Horizon, and Ghost of Tsushima have all found a home in the Secret Lair brand, which is described as:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…<strong>the party inside the party at Magic: The Gathering</strong>. We combine everything we love about Magic with the stuff in pop culture that inspires us. Each drop puts a brand-new spin on your favorite cards and might even have something entirely new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Fallout MTG Secret Lair line is the next big entrant into that universe, and it’s coming soon.</p>



<p>Secret Lair and Magic confirmed that the Fallout Rad Superdrop line will go live on January 26, exclusively <a href="https://secretlair.wizards.com/us/#rad_superdrop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the Secret Lair site</a>.</p>



<p>There’s also something special for the diehard fans willing to part ways with a hefty amount of cash – the <strong>Secret Lair x Fallout Silver Shroud Costume </strong>promo card, only available once you’ve spent at least $149 USD.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Fallout Secret Lair pack sits the Beyond Vault 33 centrepiece. This includes the entire line-up of the Fallout TV show characters, imagined in a range of settings and outfits. That’s especially true for Lucy MacLean, arguably the lead of the Fallout show above The Ghoul and Maximus, who is shown in the many outfits she has worn as the show has unravelled.</p>



<p>It doesn’t end there, though – many sub-sets make up the Secret Lair x Fallout drop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Greet the Dog</li>



<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Rad</li>



<li>Secret Lair x Fallout: Welcome to New Vegas</li>
</ul>



<p>For each pack, foil prices will be between $39.99 and $49.99, while non-foil prices will be from $29.99 to $39.99.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast has advised that stock is likely to sell out very fast, especially given the hype around Fallout as the second season of the show unravels and the game franchise remains extremely popular.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has some certifiably fantastic deals on TCGs right now, and that's including an all-time new best price on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBedw?object_uuid=b4a55666-8cc5-4640-b554-8b5f63a288ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon TCG: Mega Evolution - Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Boxes</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was a huge deal last year when these were even in stock, let alone at a new best price. At $75, I'd snap this up ASAP, as it's even cheaper than the market price seen at trusted resellers like TCGplayer.</p><div id="228294"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228294" data-cy="solo-product-card"><div><p>ME02: Phantasmal Flames (PFL)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't have to tell you why ETBs are the marquee product for each set, and Phantasmal Flames is no different. Packed with nine booster packs, a 1 full-art foil promo card featuring <a href="https://zdcs.link/a56yNx?object_uuid=b4a55666-8cc5-4640-b554-8b5f63a288ae&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Charcadet</u></a>, themed sleeves, dice, and all the accessories needed for play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been a significant drop in price on these ETBs compared to last year as well. You'd be lucky to pick one up for around $150 resale, closer to launch in November 2025. But, now, we've seen a big ol' crash in market price, upwards of 50%. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a whole lot more Phantasmal Flames goodies up for grabs right now, at more reasonable prices. But, I'd still recommend checking on TCGplayer to ensure you're getting a good deal, or even just ordering from there altogether, as it often has the best prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, even with the prices coming down, I'd snap up the ETB at Amazon ASAP, especially while you can get it at the best price possible; with 1-2 day delivery on Prime, and so you can use any handy Amazon gift cards you've got saved up as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to just chase cards, however, I'd also recommend checking out how much some of the best single chase cards are going for right now, to pick up individually. Or, to consult after you've cracked open all your packs. Good luck!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Best Phantasmal Flames Chase Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">According <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-phantasmal-flames-most-expensive-cards"><u>TCGplayer</u>, certain Phantasmal Flames cards</a> have already skyrocketed further in price, and, following up from our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-most-expensive-cards">Mega Evolution round-up</a>, we’ve ranked the ten most expensive cards so far just above. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From aggressive Mega attackers to powerful evolution support, Phantasmal Flames brings a fiery mix of competitive threats and high-demand pulls. <strong>Let us know in the comments if you've pulled anything super rare since last year.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I'll treasure my screenshots."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Nintendo finally removed an infamous, adults only-themed island from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. Existing since 2020, the suggestive fan creation was almost as old as the game, and gained much attention from Japanese streamers for its distorted, humorous world view and huge level of detail. Despite years of work being deleted, the island’s creator expressed gratitude to both Nintendo and those who have visited over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Literally named Adults’ Island (otonatachi no shima 大人たちの島), the suggestive location was crafted by a dedicated Animal Crossing player who goes by @churip_ccc on X. As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, the island’s creator took to Twitter / X to <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment</u></a> on its removal from the game. “Nintendo, I apologize from the bottom of my heart,” they said in a tweet with 3.1 million views so far. “Rather, thank you for turning a blind eye these past five years. To everyone who visited Adults’ Island and all the streamers who featured it, thank you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of Adults’ Island first publicized the location’s Dream Address in 2020, and it was quickly picked up and <a href="https://youtu.be/LX2_XeIBrEM?si=WbfUni993m-9GdWh" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>featured by streamers in Japan</u></a>. Plastered with colorful Japanese signboards, vending machines, arcade cabinets and a lot of attention to detail, the island mimicked an entertainment and red-light district in the evening. While not explicit, the version of the characters that it presents turned Animal Crossings’ cute and wholesome image on its head.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/16/screenshot-2026-01-16-093820-1768556333196.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Adults’ Island in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Image credit: <a href="https://youtu.be/LX2_XeIBrEM?si=AySSPp1CXmG6CwlT">YouTube / コアラ's GAME SHOW</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As many Japanese streamers mentioned, the island had the atmosphere of a nostalgic entertainment district in Japan, with many details recalling the mid-to-late Showa period (1926-1989). Its vibe was also similar to the Wall Market area from the original Final Fantasy 7, with a sense of parody reminiscent of Lost Wages from 1987’s Leisure Suit Larry. The first place you came across on the island after getting off the plane was a “Free Information Center.” While this might sound innocent enough at first, such places are often found in real night life districts in Japan, and tell potential customers about adult-oriented establishments and services in the area, including bars, hostess clubs, and brothels. The inside of Adults’ Island’s Free Information Center was amusingly covered in glamorous posters of Animal Crossing characters, with advertisements for shops including a Hong Kong “massage” parlor. The island also had a smoking area with one villager dropping the bombshell that Animal Crossing character Isabelle smokes Seven Stars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Places you could visit included a 24-hour sauna called “Love Attack,” a beach-front love hotel (complete with Michelangelo statues and strategically-placed palm trees), a cabaret, and a pachinko parlor. The interiors of the residences of popular Animal Crossing characters on the island often added a naughty twist to the character (for example, Blather’s room has pictures of Isabelle surrounding his bed and used tissues on the floor- likely a side of Blather that no-one wanted to think about). The overall tone was humorous, with an NPC even explaining to you that the island’s theme park (which could also be visited and seemed to be a parody of Disney’s “It’s a Small World”) had gone bust because “there are no children here.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It also had a dark side as well, with the hut for new employees featuring a bunch of futons crammed together on a dirt floor, providing a sharp contrast to the colorful and comfortable interiors on the rest of the island. The island’s colorful Gorilla Magazine (perhaps run by Violet?) also parodies the real-life free magazines that encourage young women into nighttime work. Speaking of Violet, she is working as an oiran, a term for high ranking prostitutes in Japan’s Edo Era (1603-1868).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering that content creators in Japan had been streaming Adults’ Island since 2020, it seems likely that Nintendo was aware of the fan-created area’s existence for a while. However it's not clear why it took until 2026 for the company to delete the kinky island’s Dream Address. Perhaps <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-my-goodness-you-can-jump-strafe-and-walk-backwards-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-now">the recently released Animal Crossing: New Horizons Switch 2 update</a> jolted Nintendo into action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the creator’s tweet, Japanese-speaking fans mourned the island’s demise. Former visitors reminisced about the first time they explored the location or saw it streamed. “The shock of ‘you can do something like THIS?!’, the points of interest that made me think ‘you’re recreating THAT?!’, the sense of style, the black humor... I really liked all of it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo used to be one of the <strong>most secretive game companies around</strong>, and one of those that took the hardest stance against leakers, giving rise to the long-lasting joke that the <strong>company sends its household ninja warriors </strong>to take care of them. </p>



<p>Over the past few years, however, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">a lot of information </strong><span><strong>about the company's systems and games has leaked online</strong>&nbsp;ahead of&nbsp;</span>official announcements, such as the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which had been an <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-design-ports-leak-developers-excited/">open secret</a></strong> long before its<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/"> official reveal</a></strong> and release last year.</p>



<p>With so many leaks, one may think the Japanese company addressed the issue and <strong>tightened the lid</strong> on its future releases before their announcements, but this doesn't seem to be the case, as <strong>a possible new Nintendo Switch 2 model</strong> may have leaked online, and via one of the company's official websites, no less.</p>



<p>Bluesky user <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dootsky.re"><strong>@dootsky.re</strong></a> confirmed to have discovered <strong>something interesting</strong>. <em>"On Nintendo's Account Portal, there's an unused model code under the name "OSM". (The Switch 2's model code is BEE.)"</em></p>



<p>In addition, the portal has images for every Switch model, and <strong>requesting OSM returns the image of a Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which is confirmed not to be a random placeholder, as trying to get an image for any other combination of strings on the company's web service to generate icons returns an error message.</p>







<p>As the Bluesky user highlighted, <strong>the image for the Nintendo Switch 2 "OSM" model is the same used for the current system</strong>, so it shouldn't be used to speculate about which product OSM will be.</p>



<p>However, it's hard not to think about <strong>a Nintendo Switch 2 Lite</strong>, especially in light of what president Shuntaro Furukawa said earlier this month regarding the company's desire to make the system more accessible to people<em> "who pick up their first console when reaching a certain age." </em></p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">current RAM shortages and price spikes</strong> <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">set </span>to&nbsp;affect many<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">tech products,</a></strong> however, it remains to be seen <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much cheaper a Lite model would be</strong>, given that the current Nintendo Switch 2 model's price could increase if the situation doesn't normalize anytime soon.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">'Nintendo has been very "leaky" over the last two years. Maybe they need a plumber?'</em> commented gamerweeb1 on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/potential-new-switch-2-model-osm-discovered-on-nintendos-internal-website.1407796/post-150113233"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ResetERA forums</strong></a>, echoing a common community sentiment with a joke. <span>Hopefully, this leak will amount to something interesting, as most of the company's leaks have in the past few years, or will, at least, make a certain plumber materialize,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-odyssey-unmissable-adventure/" target="_blank"><strong>who has been absent with his 3D adventures for quite a long time.</strong></a></span></p>

            <p>
Capcom have released a new 13 minute <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> gameplay showcase, with commentary from director Koshi Nakanishi. About 20% of it is Leon Kennedy kicking zombies in the noggin, doing Wickian dodge-shoots, or chopping torsos with a chainsaw or hatchet (the latter a subweapon that needs periodic resharpening). Another 20% consists of new, stealth-oriented character Grace creeping through ornate chambers in first person; being the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-sitting-in-a-hot-sauna">"cold bath" to Leon's "hot sauna"</a>, she doesn’t have serious fighting skills, but she does have a ‘pinch hitter’ handcannon for those times when skulking behind tableware won’t cut the mustard. There’s talk of a new crafting system, whereby Grace turns zombie blood into a vaccine to stop corpses reanimating.
</p>

<p>
A solid third of the video consists of preorder collectables, GeForce Now promotion, and a much-hyped collaboration with Porsche on the design of Leon’s car. This last bit feels like two marketing teams conspiring to justify each other’s pay rises, and is about as compelling to me as putting go-faster stripes on a jar of mayonnaise. I am, however, quite intrigued by a fleeting mention that Resi 9’s garden-variety shamblers have memories. As Nakanishi puts it, “this time there are zombies that retain characteristics from when they were alive”.

<p>
We catch glimpses of this in the footage, mostly during Grace’s segments, which are more about observation. There’s a custodian who carries on cleaning the facilities, scrubbing mirrors in a frenzy. There’s a butcher with a cleaver who mechanically growls “next” to kitchen staff who have, I assume, long since been disassembled. Some of these mundane routines are tactical opportunities for Grace. There’s a zombie restlessly working a light switch, for example, creating pools of shadow for you to sneak through.
</p><p>
I don’t think this is Resident Evil seriously venturing into the realm of pathos, let alone embracing the prospect of a pacifist playthrough. Let’s not forget Leon and his hatchet. There are plenty of partly or fully sentient named undead characters in Resident Evils gone by, and I’m not sure many of them were ‘sympathetic’, exactly. Maybe you carry a candle for Wesker – good luck with that. Still, Requiem promises to make interactions with the rank-and-file infected a little more emotionally complex. Perhaps you will feel a pang now and then while you’re wiping the offal from your boots.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-casting-call/</link>
            <guid>1407955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout fans worldwide are preparing to <strong>potentially </strong>step into a real-world vault to live out their post-apocalyptic dreams in the <strong>all-new </strong>Fallout Shelter reality show. The new project was recently unveiled by Prime Video, alongside a casting call for participants. The successful applicants will live with others in a ‘real vault’ and complete challenges to hopefully be the last one left in the shelter.</p>



<p>It looks like Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video plan to make the ‘experiment’ as close to a Vault-Tec test as possible. The casting call stressed that vault dwellers will be tested with ‘escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums.’</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-shelter-s-new-reality-show-starts-production-soon">Fallout Shelter’s New Reality Show Starts Production Soon</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at Prime Video wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Good morning, prospective Vault Dwellers! In order to best serve you in What Comes Next, we need volunteers for a very real, very scientific opportunity to beta test a better society. Visit this website if you’d like to join Fallout Shelter, a new series full of escalating challenges, strategic dilemmas, and moral conundrums. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you head to the <a href="https://us.castitreach.com/ag/slus/fallout/welcome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website for the casting call</a>, you’ll be hit with all the information you need. </p>



<p>To apply, you must be at least 21 years of age, must hold a valid passport, and will need to be free for three weeks in June 2026 for filming. The casting call form is <strong>huge</strong> and asks for a heck of a lot of information, and it’s there to allow applicants to really sell themselves to Fallout Shelter’s casting team.</p>



<p>In December 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-shelter-reality-show-adaptation-claim/">it was claimed by</a> an industry insider that Fallout Shelter would be getting a live-action adaptation, but not like the Fallout television series that has been running since April 2024. Instead, it would be getting a ‘reality show’ approach, taking everyday people and throwing them into a vault to complete challenges.</p>



<p>This has materialized as fact, with Bethesda Game Studios and Prime Video officially unveiling the project.</p>



<p>Don’t be deterred, but the short trailer for the casting call stresses that ‘Vault-Tec assumes no liability for injury, dismemberment, or decapitation,’ but that’s just a joke… right?</p>



<p>It was said that the show will take on a ‘Squid Game’ or ‘MrBeast Games’ approach, whittling down the survivors as they’re eliminated one by one. There’s a cash prize for the ultimate victor, but it hasn’t been made clear yet how much that will be.</p>



<p>Fallout is exploding once again (no pun intended) as the second season of the award-winning television show started up again in December and is set to run until February 4th. There are claims of Fallout 3 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-coming-claimed/">Fallout: New Vegas remakes</a> on the horizon, and Fallout 76 just got its biggest update <strong>ever</strong>.</p>







<p>Do you want to apply for the Fallout Shelter reality show? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you think you’d win!</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon Games has announced that New World, its MMORPG first released in 2021, will shut down on the 31st January 2027. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">This comes a few months after the developer "gutted" a vast number of staff late last year</a>.</p>
<p>When those cuts were first announced, <a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/news/articles/update-on-new-world">it was revealed on the New World website</a> that its 10th season 'Nighthaven' would be its last. Now, it turns out that season will be extended until the servers are shut down. The game has been pulled from storefronts, so only those who already own the game can continue playing into next year.</p>
<p>The statement also features a farewell from the remaining New World team, which reads: "We want to thank the players for your dedication and passion. We are grateful for the time spent crafting the world of Aeternum with you. Together we built something special. While we are saddened to say goodbye, we're honored that we were able to share so much with the community.</p>

<p>"It has been our pleasure to work on New World: Aeternum and evolve this unforgettable adventure with you all. We look forward to one more year together, and giving this fantastic adventure a sendoff worthy of a legendary hero. From the bottom of all our hearts, thank you for sharing this world with us."</p><p>In response to this news however, a potential sprinkle of hope from COO of Facepunch Alistair McFarlane. Known as the studio behind Rust, the UK-based developer has built itself a solid foundation in the tumultuous games industry. Solid enough, it seems, to allow McFarlane to offer an eye-watering amount for the ill-fated MMO.</p>
<p>"25m, final offer" McFarlane <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011890710468071708">posted on Twitter</a> in response to the news last night. He'd follow this up with "Games should never die", indicating this to be a genuine offer (Eurogamer has contacted Facepunch to confirm).</p>
<p>Another noteworthy figure in the world of buying video game rights also popped their head up, with <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011991595273572406">Simon Collins-Laflamme of Hypixel Games writing</a>: "If you need tips about buying cancelled games, lmk". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">Laflamme bought Hytale back from Riot Games last year</a>, releasing it this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">to monumental success</a>.</p>

<p>A new leak reveals that the LEGO Zelda 2026 set is LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time; check out the price, release date, and other details below. </p>



<p>For those unaware, LEGO had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a new The Legend of Zelda set late last year, with a release date window set for 2026. It seems that the Nintendo partnership is growing faster than ever, with the Great Deku Tree set in 2024, LEGO Mario in 2025, and the recently revealed LEGO <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-reveals-first-five-pokemon-sets-releasing-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon sets</a> for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-lego-the-legend-of-zelda-the-final-battle-ocarina-of-time-set-reportedly-releasing-in-march-2026">LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time Set Reportedly Releasing in March 2026</h2>



<p>A new leak on the Brick Tap <a href="https://discord.gg/wgcCpdMk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> reveals that the next set will feature LEGO The Legend of Zelda: The Final Battle – Ocarina of Time.

            <p>The recently teased Legend of Zelda: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> Lego set has leaked.</p>
<p>According to a Brick Tap source, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">upcoming Zelda set</a> will be known as The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time, and depict, well, the final battle from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>On the box, we can see the chunky porcine Ganon standing tall and wielding his dual blades, while Link gets ready to strike down on the beast with his Master Sword. The titular Princess Zelda, meanwhile, is standing to one side, and has a Lego-fied beam of light emitting from her hands.</p>

<p>According to the leak, which was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/">shared on reddit</a> earlier this morning, Lego's The Final Battle: Ocarina of Time set will comprise 1003 pieces, and retail for £100 here in the UK.</p>
<p>Along with Link, Zelda and Ganondorf (as in, in his Gerudo chief form), the set will also include a Navi model, as well as - of course - a brick built model of the boar-like Ganon, which in personal opinion looks rather magnificent.</p><p>Should this leak be accurate, we can also expect to see the game's Megaton Hammer and a number of recovery hearts to also be included on the set's release. As for when that will be, the source said we are looking at a 1st March debut, which is actually quite soon.</p>

<p>This of course isn't Lego's only collaboration with Nintendo. Earlier this week, the two companies unveiled their previously announced Pokémon sets, which include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-unveiled-but-catching-em-all-will-cost-you">Pikachu and Poké Ball, Venusaur, Charizard, Blastoise and Eevee</a>.</p>
<p>Soon after these particular sets went live, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-really-want-those-pokemon-lego-kanto-region-badges-you-can-expect-to-pay-over-100-on-ebay-thanks-to-scalpers">resale sites such as eBay became awash with the Lego Pokémon Kanto Region Badge Collection</a>, which was only available via Lego as a free gift for those that pre-ordered the most expensive set from the collection, the Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise model.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Dreams of Another is just about the most confounding game I have ever played. There is no creation without destruction, says the game, so you use an assault rifle to shoot the world back together from the clouds of bubbles around you. Meanwhile, you’re following the footsteps of a mole who dies once you get there, picking up random engagement rings or other stuff off the floor to give to a soldier who can’t shoot a gun, who tends to reward you with some grenades. Every detail from every angle in this game is weird. Listen, I’m King Weird – I reviewed and enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/29/blippo-review/">Blippo+</a> in the last few months – but this? This has gone straight through weird and come out the other side – into bad.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dreams of Another - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zA1z-_pgZso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’ll start with the visuals. Striking in both positive and negative ways, the clouds of bubbles coming together as you shoot them is undeniably very pretty. Unsurprisingly, this is what initially drew me to the game, that and the whole “no creation without destruction” ethos. I mean, what’s not to like about marvelling at pretty visuals whilst a slightly artsy and heady narrative plays out. Plus, it’s made by Pixeljunk, who have made some exceptional games throughout the years, incredibly playable and unique masterpieces like Pixeljunks Eden and Shooter, so no doubt they would get some interesting ideas here. But, the problem is, there aren’t any beyond that first thought. </p>


<p>You shoot clouds of bubbles, it takes shape as an object, a building, a fence, whatever. Then you do it again. &nbsp;It’s not just the environment that needs to be fixed. It’s also people, so everyone you speak to is also made out of little floating particles which means two things: one, they don’t look convincingly person-like, and; two, means you can pass your gun through them when you’re in VR and they warp around it, which is fun for a minute or so.</p>


<p>Sure, there’s floating, spiky balls of white that fly around and, if you shoot those enough, they’ll break and restore the environment around them. But, they move around at random seemingly, usually away from things I need restoring, so I’m better off using one of the 18 grenades I’m carrying. Occasionally there’s something a bit different, like a ferris wheel comes loose and you shoot the cars, one by one, to stop it, or a circle (?) rolls around on the floor but otherwise behaves exactly like a spiky white ball. The only way of interacting with anything in this game other than shooting/grenading it, is talking to it. </p>
<p>People will tell you their secrets or desires, or why they’re here, or explain about moles or something, something that usually means very little to you because you don’t know how it’s relevant. At all. Objects will tell you about their experience being objects, you’ll stand there and blink confusedly, then you move on to more wall shooting. Since you spend all your time reconstituting the environments with your gun, the wonder you initially felt at everything taking shape doesn’t make it past the first 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Now, I could forgive the light or poorly considered gameplay if there was an engaging narrative, but the way Dreams of Another progresses is completely unbelievable. You spend the first couple of hours not only shooting environments back together, but repeatedly shooting the same environments back together over and over again. There is a scene with moles climbing a wall in a sewer that I think I saw five separate times, and I had to shoot it all back together each time and sit there whilst they climbed the wall again. </p>
<p>When a scene ends, all the particles float upwards, which looks pretty cool the first time, but quickly becomes a joke as you complete scenes that are twenty seconds long with two lines of dialogue you’ve already heard in a place you’ve been to before. And it often cuts back to the main menu so you can see a person lying in a bed and select the option to continue. This menu changes depending how far into the game you are, which is presumably why it cuts back to it so you can see it, but it’s incredibly clumsy and happens so often that by the time something significant enough to matter has changed on the menu, you’ve probably clicked back into the game before you notice. Assuming you haven’t already just turned it off.</p>

<p>Dreams of Another is the least narratively accessible game I’ve ever played. It takes an hour or so for a hint of a thread connecting the scenes you’re sitting through, and the entire time it feels like the opening minutes of a game where you don’t have a clue what’s happening yet. On top of that, it’s also the least immersive game you could play, with scenes ending by melting upwards abruptly, the constant cuts to the menu, and some of the worst voice acting you have ever experienced. I don’t know, sometimes it sounds like they’re trying to speak slowly like they’re in a surreal dream, but some of them, including the very first voice you hear, just don’t work whatsoever.</p>
<p>Maybe you could play in VR, that’s more immersive right? No, you’ve fallen for my rhetorical trick! Instead, you have cutscenes play out in a window in front of you, though at least they’re in 3D even though they warp when you move your head around. You also get some pretty poor controls as well, with you picking things up by walking over them and interaction generally being fiddly. The gun has 100 rounds in a mag, unlimited ammo, and automatically reloads itself when empty with no input from you whether you’re in VR or not, unless you want to reload early. It may as well be a wizard staff.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘We Won’t Implement GenAI Into Our Games Without Prior Notice’, Vows Granblue Developer Cygames]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Japanese developer <strong>Cygames</strong>, known mainly for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-sold-2-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Granblue Fantasy</a></strong>, <strong>Shadowverse</strong>, and <strong>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</strong> franchises, has recently faced significant backlash from several of its otherwise staunch fans over the establishment of a subsidiary, <strong>Cygames AI Studio</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Announced last week</a>, Cygames AI Studio is a new division whose purpose is to pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. The company's goal is to build a '<strong>unique creative cycle</strong>' that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity. The announcement also mentioned that, with this new AI ​​Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being a company that '<strong>creates the best content</strong>.' As mentioned above, the news wasn't taken kindly by many of the studio's usual supporters. Now, the developer <a href="https://x.com/Cygames_EN/status/2011423481712517537?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has shared a public letter of apology</a> in which it vowed that <strong>no genAI assets have been used in their games</strong>, and that <strong>genAI wouldn't be implemented at all in their games</strong> without prior notice.</p>



<p><em>To all our Cygames fans and supporters, </em></p>



<p><em>Over the past few days, we've received numerous comments expressing anger and disappointment from many of you. This was because we released a simplified announcement in Japanese concerning the founding of Cygames AI Studio, Inc., without addressing any of the current problems and social debates surrounding generative AI. We sincerely apologize for the concern we've caused.</em></p>



<p><em>We would like to take this opportunity to state that art produced from genAI isn't used in our products. Furthermore, we won't implement genAI into our products without prior notice. We hold in the highest regard those who love games, as well as the dignity, passion, and heart of the creators and artists who act as the architects of gaming culture. The art for all current Cygames games and other products is crafted from the technical know-how and manual work of our many staff members.</em></p>



<p><em>Once again, we deeply apologize for causing our beloved fans much grief and anxiety. We at Cygames will continue to honor creators, as well as champion the free expression of people, and, in doing so, will continue to strive to be the best in entertainment. Thank you for your continued support.</em></p>



<p>The Japanese developer is only the latest to become embroiled in controversy over genAI. The most famous case recently was undoubtedly <strong>Larian</strong>'s: when studio founder and CEO <strong>Swen Vincke</strong> mentioned in an interview that they had been experimenting with genAI to quickly develop concept art and write placeholder text <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">while working on the new <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>, a massive backlash ensued, forcing Vincke and Larian as a whole to first say that <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'a lot had been lost in translation'</a> and then, last week, to <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">backtrack on any usage of genAI</a> to make concept art or even placeholder text for the upcoming game.</p>



<p>No doubt, more controversies within the industry are on the way, given the polarizing subject. On which side are you on? Speak your mind in the comments.</p>

            <p>After the undeniable success of its live-action adaptation, Amazon Prime Video has announced a reality television show based on the Fallout games.</p>
<p>The show itself is known as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-shelter">Fallout Shelter</a>, and will see contestants living inside a vault set within a "high-stakes world", with those taking part competing for a "huge" cash prize.</p>

<p>"Set inside Vault-Tec's bomb-proof vaults, Fallout Shelter drops a diverse group of contestants into an immersive, high-stakes world inspired by the games' signature dark humor, retro-futurism, and post-apocalyptic survival storytelling," reads Fallout Shelter's official logline.</p>
<p>The show itself will present competitors with "a series of escalating challenges", as well as "strategic dilemmas" and some "moral crossroads" to navigate. I mean, of course! And, as this show is based on Fallout, these challenges and games will all have some kind of focus on the franchise's core SPECIAL attributes. That's strength, perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and luck.</p>

Casting will close on 15th February. "Do you have what it takes to be the most SPECIAL?" the casting crew asks. Well, do you?</p>
