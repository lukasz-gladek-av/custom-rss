            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24185747/xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="bwAIzv">There’s a lot to love about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox/2019/6/9/18658748/xbox-elite-controller-series-2-e3-2019-release-date-specs-microsoft">Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller</a>: interchangeable thumbsticks with adjustable tension, multiple paddles (also interchangeable), a comfortable rubber grip. There’s also one thing that’s been slightly less loved: a $179.99 price tag that has persisted since its 2019 debut. </p>
<p id="b0Jh2h">As <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1805631532843024522">pointed out by Wario64</a>, Lenovo’s online store has an <a href="https://howl.me/cmxqsjlFMS4">Xbox Elite Series 2 controller deal</a> that substantially assuages that concern. Using the code <strong>XBOXELITE</strong> at checkout will drop the price down to a much more reasonable $95. That’s a savings of $84.99, or about 47 percent off the MSRP—whichever way you want to math it out, it’s a compelling deal if you were looking for a first-party upgrade. </p>

<p id="n2oHFh">The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller works both wired (via USB-C cable) and wirelessly (via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth) for both console and PC. It won’t make you better at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>. Or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC</a>... but it <em>might </em>make playing feel a little better as you improve.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24185675/lara-croft-dead-by-daylight-survivor-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lara-croft-is-the-next-survivor-to-join-dead-by-daylight%E2%80%99s-huge-roster.911016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185675/lara-croft-dead-by-daylight-survivor-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="i9vXos"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/dead-by-daylight/39050"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a> is packed full of original characters, but it’s also known to cross over with other properties. This started exclusively with horror icons like Nightmare on Elm Street series’ Freddy Krueger and Pyramid Head from <em>Silent Hill</em>, but it’s expanded into less expected properties like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24155430/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover-vecna"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, the real life actor <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23784793/dead-by-daylight-nicolas-cage-dlc-release-date">Nicolas Cage</a>, and now <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/lara-croft-in-dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider/">Tomb Raider superstar Lara Croft</a>.</p>
<p id="prSLTM">In the lore of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, both Killers and Survivors are pulled into a dark realm ruled over by the extraplanar god known as the Entity. It seems like Lara’s various adventures and expeditions was enough to capture the Entity’s attention and see her claimed by the supernatural Fog. Lara Croft will arrive alone, with no map or associated Killer, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/1/30/24054923/alan-wake-dead-by-daylight-crossover-synergy">similar to her colleague Alan Wake</a>.</p>
<p id="sUcWPe">Like other Survivors, Lara comes with three perks that affect her gameplay.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="dwWlB5"><strong>Finesse</strong></p>
<p id="TEhYI7">This perk activates while you are healthy. Your fast vaults are 20% faster. This perk goes on cooldown for 40/35/30 seconds after performing a fast vault.</p>
<p id="RCrLuf"><strong>Hardened</strong></p>
<p id="Ul7o59">After you unlock a chest and cleanse or bless a totem, this perk activates. Anytime you would scream, reveal the Killer’s aura for<strong> 3/4/5 seconds</strong> instead.</p>
<p id="mJvSDE"><strong>Specialist</strong></p>
<p id="QqRqMM">Each time you open or rummage through a chest, gain 1 token, up to 3/3/3. When you do a great skill check on a generator, consume all tokens. Then for each token consumed, reduce the maximum required generator progress by 2/3/4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="XG4FEx">Over the years, <em>Dead by Daylight </em>has moved away from solely using horror characters, and introduced more action- or thriller-oriented characters as well. Lara Croft is a popular choice for such crossovers; she appears in many other games, including Call of Duty, <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, <em>Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p>
<p id="x1WrQV">The next licensed tie-in after Lara Croft will likely be the Castlevania crossover, announced earlier this year. Expect more info on the Castlevania chapter later this summer.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24185778/chained-together-co-op-platformer-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chained-together-is-the-cruel-co-op-platformer-that%E2%80%99s-blowing-up-on-steam.911013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185778/chained-together-co-op-platformer-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9ihOp5">There’s a genre of game I lovingly call “antics generators” — games where the high points include players howling over voice chat and perfectly clippable moments to share on social media. <em>Lethal Company</em>, <em>Fall Guys</em>, and the Mario Party franchise are perfect examples of this phenomenon, and it looks like another contender is emerging: <em>Chained Together</em>, a co-op game about escaping hell with three of your buddies.</p>
<p id="qPfPW0"><em>Chained Together</em>, which has proved popular on Steam since it was released on June 19, has a simple premise: platform your way out of hell. The catch is — and you may have guessed this from the title of the game — that you and your friends are chained together. You can play solo or in a four-person squad, and the wackiest way to play is with a full team. </p>
<p id="CLK4BF">As you get out of hell, the climbing becomes increasingly difficult. Even if you play impeccably, a slip-up from one of your teammates sends all of you back to the depths of hell. It’s co-op <em>QWOP</em>.</p>
<div id="bu2nf7"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nJQgEBwjgBs" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></p></div>

<p id="1RhzaG">This kind of game already does well on streaming — consider the success of <em>Getting Over It</em>, or the similar platformer <em>Only Up</em> — but when you add in the chaotic element of co-op, it gets very silly very quickly. There are sometimes moments where you save one of your pals with some lucky chain physics, and at that point you feel like a solid team made up of comrades. But most runs are defined by plummeting back into the depths as everyone shouts at each other.</p>
<p id="4AuYU5">There are ways to adjust the difficulty; a run can be much friendlier with the checkpoint system enabled, allowing you to try again from the highest point you’ve reached. Or, if you’re particularly devious, there’s a hard mode where lava chases you upward to make you climb faster. To many players, the tough circumstances are part of the charm — it allows for big saves and dramatic victories.</p>


<p id="eHobqQ">And for other players, the frustration is part of the fun. Having one of your friends doom you to a fall as everyone howls and hoots over voice chat is delightful. It’s chaotic and intense, and the first time I played it with friends it ended with us deciding to collectively rage quit. After cooling down, we agreed to schedule another night, because the fury was just part of the fun. But those frustrating moments of getting nailed out of nowhere with an obstacle, or missing a narrow platform, just make the success of climbing all the sweeter.</p>
<p id="YfyjiI"><em>Chained Together</em> is available for around $5, and it’s likely not an experience that can keep a group playing for months — but it’s a solid antics-heavy game that challenges players to overcome not just the map, but to work together as a team, even when someone misses their jump and pulls the group back down to the pits of hell.</p>

		<p>THQ Nordic has confirmed that Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be released on September 24th, and has also launched pre-orders for the collector’s edition. That edition of the Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will set you back $199.99/£174.99. Those who pre-order digitally will get a costume pack with three skins and 24 hours early access, but the caveat is that the early access is for consoles only. The standard version is priced at £49.99, though <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CW3N62GY?th=1">Amazon has priced it at £40.95</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopto.net/en/ps5di03-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-playstation-5-p1180965/">Shopto have it for £40.85</a>.</p>

<p>The collector’s edition of Disney Epic Mickey Rebrushed will include a 28cm Mickey Mouse statue, n Oswald the Lucky Rabbit keychain, a vintage Mickey Mouse tin sign, six Disney Epic Mickey postcards, a Collector’s Steelbook, and the Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed costume pack.</p>
<p>The original Epic Mickey was released in November 2010 and follows Mickey as he breaks in to a world of “forgotten things”, concept art and animations for cartoons that never made it to the screen. The levels are loosely a based on locations at the Disneyland theme park, and Mickey will be tormented by Shadow Blot, a creature he created but based on the Phantom Blot, an antagonist to Mickey his original comic strips. A sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, followed in 2012.</p>


<p>In our review for the original Disney Epic Mickey, Dan said, <em>“Bitterly, bitterly disappointed is my summation of the last ten plus hours. At its core DEM is a solid game which flits between genius and mediocrity, yet is mired by a camera system that is fundamentally broken. Disney fans will find lots to love, as it is complete fan service, and there is a good story to enjoy. “</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24185483/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="x8V3a3">There’s an arcade-themed bar near where I live in south London that has an original <em>Monkey Ball</em> cabinet. This classic 2001 Sega cab, which became a Nintendo GameCube launch game called <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, features a single banana-shaped joystick before an angled screen. Players use the banana to guide AiAi, a monkey in a ball, to the end of tricky platforming stages. It’s goofy, minimalist, and brilliant — even 23 years ago, it felt like a time warp back to the surreal innocence of early video games.</p>
<p id="UIFbt6">I played the shit out of <em>Super Monkey Ball </em>on the GameCube; it’s one of my favorite games ever. When I spotted the old cabinet in the bar, I had to try it. I didn’t do that well — the banana joystick had seen better days and was a bit slack, with a roomy dead zone. (Also, I was a few cocktails deep into my evening by that point.) But the game itself folded the preceding two decades down to nothing. The feel of the ball physics, the routes through the stages, the shortcuts with their risky ricochets and heart-in-mouth tumbles — all of it was still there, programmed into my muscle memory, ready and waiting to be revived by an instantly recognizable blast of cheery techno music.</p>
<p id="AhrAHV">Monkey Ball went on to become a modest franchise for Sega, fueled in part by the GameCube game’s addition of a suite of inventive, comical party games (Monkey Target, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Golf, and more). But the perfection of the 2001 game’s original set of single-player stages turned out to be tough for the developers to follow. It’s difficult to elaborate meaningfully on something so simple and pure; every subsequent release ended up diluting it.</p>

<p id="AiE5sK">To make matters worse for Monkey Ball, the Sega team that made these games soon had another hit franchise on its hands, and it couldn’t have been more different: Yakuza, now called Like a Dragon. The studio that had once been called Amusement Vision, then CS1 R&amp;D, eventually renamed itself Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio after the Japanese name for its series of sprawling gangster melodramas.</p>
<p id="HNz4OO">RGG Studio didn’t have much time left for AiAi and his friends, and the series fell fallow for a while in the 2010s. But after remakes of the first three games and <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Blitz</em> revived interest, RGG Studio decided to have another go. The result is <em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>: a new release for Nintendo Switch, the first original Monkey Ball title in a decade, and a take on the series that’s simultaneously fresh and deeply nostalgic.</p>
<p id="WayJgr">The basics haven’t changed: Get to the goal before the time runs out and pick up bananas on the way. As ever, the trick to Super Monkey Ball is understanding that you’re really tilting the whole level rather than controlling the ball. <em>Banana Rumble</em> is super smooth (the adventure mode runs at a flawless 60 frames per second) and instinctive to play. The levels are pretty easy in the early part of the game, with lots of broad, safe platforms to roll along, and they tend toward interactive elements and away from the extremely tough balancing challenges of the original.</p>

<p id="PFlC0b">But RGG Studio has layered the difficulty with meta-challenges for each level — target completion time (usually just a few seconds), total bananas collected, and a golden banana to aim for — as well as a new spin dash move that can be charged up to give your simian orb an extra speed boost. Pressing a button in Monkey Ball? Sacrilege! …Although, just think of the shortcut opportunities it opens up.</p>
<p id="GpeF5t">“We looked to lower the difficulty level on the early worlds of Adventure Mode, but the new spin dash technique broadened the possibilities of how users can beat any given level and made each stage worth playing, even for advanced players,” director Daisuke Takahata told Polygon over email. Takahata leads a team at RGG that includes several Monkey Ball veterans, including Yukio Oda, a level designer who’s worked on many games in the series, all the way back to the original.</p>
<p id="byPlTy">“The Super Monkey Ball series uses a unique physics system that allows for the creation of essentially any type of level, and we are proud to say this approach is a wonderful way to stimulate the imagination of level designers,” Oda explained, also over email. “Even after looking back over 20 years, there are many levels that I think are very original. I think that the originality of the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is the DNA of the series, so I made <em>Banana Rumble</em> keeping all of this in mind while also trying to adapt it to the changing times and the needs of the players.”</p>

<p id="wYjMei">In their answers, Takahata and Oda made several references to responding to shifting tastes among players, and if <em>Banana Rumble</em> is more welcoming and flexible than Monkey Ball games used to be, that’s probably why. But Oda pointed out that players have been surprising the developers since day one. “I have been involved in the series for many years, and I feel that more than half of the shortcuts found so far were not intended at all by the level designer. We are often surprised to learn of these unexpected shortcuts through various online videos,” he said.</p>
<p id="gIbp9U">Some innovations don’t have the design impact you would expect, however. <em>Banana Rumble </em>supports four-player co-op in the adventure mode — essentially allowing four players to pool their efforts to beat a stage simultaneously — but Takahata says this didn’t really influence the level design at all. There’s also a 16-player battle mode, but its slow, choppy frame rate feels anathema to Monkey Ball play. This is one game series for which a solid 60 fps needs to be a baseline requirement.</p>
<p id="mUeLda">One of my greatest gaming memories is defeating the “0.1 string” on the Advanced 11 stage of the original <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. This simple but devious level is shaped like a guitar, presenting four “strings” — straight routes to the goal — of increasing narrowness. The 0.1 string is a tenth as wide as your monkey’s ball, and for a long time, it seemed impossible to me. But with patient coaching from a friend, I made it, and realized it had been quite simple all along; it wasn’t a test of skill, but a test of nerve.</p>

<p id="h1ZFwX">“If you still remember that stage today, it means that I was able to create a memorable level,” Oda said. “If I were to comment on that stage in particular, I would say the theme would be ‘courage and confidence,’ along with ‘challenging yourself and the sense of accomplishment that follows.’ When designing the most difficult stages, it is also important that it makes users think, ‘I almost beat it!’ and ‘So close!’ But if a stage is just too difficult, and you have no idea how to clear it, or if you fall down in an unreasonable way, it wouldn’t make you want to try again, right?”</p>
<p id="9IFMv9">It’s fun to think of Oda, who designed those brilliant, maddening stages back in 2001, returning to continue his life’s work, but surrounded by other developers making the street-brawling combat, loquacious cutscenes, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24050765/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-animal-crossing-minigame-dondoko-island-yakuza">bizarro minigames</a> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24047430/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-pc-xbox-ps5"><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em></a>. (Takahata said the Like a Dragon team helped playtest <em>Banana Rumble</em>, and their perspective helped with “the overall quality of the level design.”) The studio that made <em>Banana Rumble</em> has changed a lot over the last two decades, but the simple joy of the Monkey Ball series remains. It’s refreshed, even; <em>Banana Rumble</em> is the first new entry in a long while that feels more like a love letter than an obligation. Oda said one thing — perhaps the most important thing — about making Monkey Ball hasn’t changed at all over the last 20 years: “The fun we had while creating it has not changed in the slightest. :)” </p>

  <p id="epkcnr">When Spry Fox co-founder and studio director David Edery and his team set out to make a second <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22368702/cozy-grove-review-nintendo-switch-pc-animal-crossing-review">Cozy Grove</a> game, they wanted to mirror the first game, but “bigger and better.” The concept of the original game and its new sequel, <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, is simple: Each day, you check in on the bear spirits at camp, helping them accomplish tasks in exchange for wares and spirit logs, which feed and grow your fire, Flamey.</p>
<p id="LafvlX">When Flamey eats enough logs, new areas of the island get unlocked, with new spirits that reside there. Each day, you help the spirits return color to their sections of the map, learning stories of their living days as you go. Interactive elements like piles of leaves, fish, and bugs are randomly regenerated on the map, making the same areas intriguing to explore even after months of playing.</p>

<p id="JbmkeB">And if the satisfying task completion and foraging isn’t enough to hook you, the story likely will be. As a human camper from another realm, the player is in a unique position to help the ghostly bears, who share very human stories of loss, regret, and fear. Their tales are written in quippy dialogue that only serves to further endear them to you — and that’s to say nothing of the sweet symbolism of how they’re illustrated, molded into cubic shapes and blended with items from their past lives. </p>
<p id="98SZu5">As Edery said at a presser for <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, the games aren’t necessarily for children. In the new game, developed by Spry Fox and published by Netflix, one NPC shares about their struggle to communicate with their immigrant mother who speaks a different language. Another navigates a deep betrayal by their business partner.</p>

<p id="4PQcGn">The gameplay is much the same between the two games, though <em>Camp Spirit</em> incorporates lots of new elements and minigames like hosing down dirty buildings — and Edery said the studio plans to continue updating <em>Camp Spirit </em>as it learns more about how people are playing the game. (It has no plans to keep the original <em>Cozy Grove</em> updated at the moment, for the record.) </p>
<p id="I6z48S">Spry Fox certainly accomplished what it set out to do by expanding the game while also fixing some quirks of the original engine that led to limitations and bugs. <em>Camp Spirit </em>includes several buildings, for instance — not just your own tent, which was the only interior in <em>Cozy Grove</em>. </p>
<p id="gb9yRb">“By taking the time to rebuild major parts of the Cozy Grove codebase, we unlocked the ability to add more interior spaces and even whole new islands to the game, should we choose to do so,” Edery wrote in an email to Polygon. Those interiors, like the inside of Orsina’s caves or the packed-up remnants of Kumari’s failed business, leave room for novel illustrations that you wouldn’t see in the rest of the game, which is set outside.</p>

<p id="To5leD">The revamped code also allows for something <em>Cozy Grove</em> players have wanted for years: multiplayer. While I wasn’t able to test multiplayer before launch, the game introduced me to the mechanics via NPCs. Players will be able to see their friends on their islands asynchronously (as in, you can collaborate with them to forage better items at any time, not only when the other player is online).</p>
<p id="lBL4HD">There are still a few of those small glitches that occurred in the original game, like the occasional frame skip. But the main problem with <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em> has nothing to do with the game at all — it’s about the platform and publisher.</p>
<p id="B3ZaD3">The only way to play <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em> currently is by downloading the game on your app store and logging into your Netflix account when the app launches. If you don’t subscribe to Netflix, you can’t play the game.</p>
<p id="tZ9k4a">It’s unhelpful to criticize Spry Fox for any of this — Netflix acquired the studio outright in October 2022 — and Edery described the relationship as “a safe harbor in the storm” of the current games industry. According to Edery, the Netflix deal meant the devs and designers didn’t have to worry much about things like marketing the game — a huge win for what was once a small indie game.</p>
<p id="xHuh1I">But the way Netflix has decided to launch the game means that it’s currently only available on mobile (iOS and Android). To play <em>Cozy Grove: Camp Spirit</em>, you must first download the Netflix app and log in. Then, go to games, click on <em>Camp Spirit</em>, and download the game, where you’ll log in to Netflix once more.</p>
<p id="E6LB4F">I tested <em>Camp Spirit</em> on my iPhone 15, using my touchscreen as my controller. It’s often fine. It’s also often cramped, if not occasionally frustrating. My finger covers up the grid when I use Decoration Mode to place items, and the UI overlaps with itself during certain actions, I assume due to the size of my screen. </p>

<p id="G0zWU0">The optional zoomed-out view makes this a bit better when you’re traversing your island, but it irks me that I couldn’t choose from the beginning to start my game on Steam for bigger screen real estate and WASD controls. (For what it’s worth, that’s coming from someone who plays mobile games daily.)</p>
<p id="rpEdoQ">“I can say that we definitely want Cozy Grove to be available on all the platforms that Netflix is, which of course, long-term, includes TVs and PCs/Macs,” Edery told Polygon. </p>
<p id="FhHakM">In terms of input, you can play with any controller compatible with your mobile device, or even an Apple Pencil, according to Edery. In the past, Polygon reporter Nicole Carpenter has posited that the original game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22375612/cozy-grove-apple-arcade-preferred-device-mobile">was actually better on mobile</a>, and Edery said the numbers back that up: “Given how well Cozy Grove did on Apple Arcade, my guess is that quite a lot of people are going to prefer playing with touch on a phone.”</p>
<p id="kffgK7">Those gripes aside, I can’t stress enough that if you already have a Netflix account, you’re going to want to play this game. The grind-to-fun ratio is excellent, and there’s so little pressure to log in that it actually motivates me to log in <em>more</em> — I’m simply thinking about my bears organically, rather than stressing about whether I’ll finish every daily task before the end of the day.</p>
<p id="4egUfu">In that sense, mobile is a fitting platform for <em>Camp Spirit</em>, because the game isn’t meant to take up hours upon hours of your life (try me, Spry Fox). “We’re a game that folds into your life — you have a lot of other obligations,” lead designer Alicia Fortier said during the <em>Camp Spirit</em> press event. </p>
<p id="lSwLgO">Rather than playing on your starved dopamine receptors like tons of other mobile games do, <em>Camp Spirit </em>isn’t so desperate for your attention. The feeling I get while playing the game, whether I’m standing still and listening to the music while I write game reviews or hunting feverishly for a lost item I’ve been looking for all day, is that the island exists whether I’m there or not — but the bears really like it when I’m there. </p>

Of course for owners of the new expansion, the inclusion of <em>Dawntrail</em>’s new quests, jobs, and continent is the big draw, but this massive patch brings a lot of new features for all players. The standout is the graphical update to the game, which has been a long time coming for the decade-old MMO. While character models and certain weapons, gear, and environments will get the update, you might not see drastic changes across all of Eorzea. That’s because the graphical update will apply to <em>Dawntrail</em> content first, with other parts of the game getting texture upgrades later down the line. So you might not see prettier trees while running old content but your Viera will look much better.</p><p>On the topic of looking good, you will now be able to dye gear with two colors! There are also new hairstyles to play with in the graphical update. And if you’re thinking you might want to change up your character’s look in more significant ways at some point, don’t miss out on the new quest “Bottled Fantasy” in Uldah that is being added with 7.0. This will be available to all players who have finished the “The Scions of the Seventh Dawn” main quest from <em>A Realm Reborn </em>and grant a free Fantasia, which can be used to change your race at any time. If you want to try out playing as a female Hrothgar, pick this quest up ASAP. </p><p>A small quality-of-life change for players still completing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span> is a reduction in the number of Aether Currents in that expansion’s maps, which you previously needed to find all 10 of in a given area before you could fly there. We don’t know the new number but anybody who has met the new requirement will immediately unlock the ability to fly in each area. And for those exploring <em>Dawntrail</em> (now or when the full release drops), an absolutely incredible new setting will let you hide nearby players when close to quest-related NPCs. That means no more trying to click through hordes of players crowding that one guy you need to click to move forward.</p><p>Finally, Square Enix has implemented a change to the annoying stealth missions expansions tend to have. These are missions that require you to follow an NPC and stay out of sight as well as a certain distance away from them. The distance and sight line are not indicated in any real way, which led to players constantly having to start these frustrating missions over. Patch 7.0 changes this by adding indicators for sight line and distance.</p><p>There are a lot more small bug fixes and tweaks to the many systems of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> in patch 7.0.

<p>Playground Games has announced that Forza Horizon 4 is set to be delisted from digital storefronts worldwide at the end of the year due to licensing issues. It was confirmed in a recent blog post that the game will be taken offline from December 15, 2024, making both the game and any additional contact unavailable for purchase on digital stores on Xbox and PC. </p>



<p>From today, Forza Horizon 4’s DLC will be delisted, with the full game being taken down in several months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-road">End of the Road</h2>



<p><a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting">Playground Games and Microsoft confirmed</a> that discounts will be offered across the Forza Horizon 4 suite, making the game a little more affordable before it’s inevitably pulled offline later in 2024. It was stressed that existing players will still be able to access their game after December 15, but no new users will be able to get involved with the platform.</p>



<p>It was also revealed that users who played Forza Horizon 4 through Game Pass and who purchased DLC will receive ‘a game token’ as compensation. </p>



<p>It was then said that the game’s final series – Series 77 – will start on July 25 and that it’ll usher in the last Festival Playlist for the game, which will debut on August 22. Following that, there will be no more content added to the game, the playlist menu will disappear, and only a skeleton platform will remain in terms of events until December 15, when the game is delisted.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 4 was released in 2018 and has since been ‘replaced’ by Forza Horizon 5, which was released to an overwhelmingly popular reception in 2021.</p>

<p>If you find yourself craving a little Destiny 2 in the middle of the work week, well, you’re not alone. Unfortunately, it appears Destiny 2 is down for maintenance. Developer Bungie revealed its maintenance schedule for the day, and the servers will remain down for a few hours total.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-destiny-2-down">How Long is Destiny 2 Down?</h2>



<p>Currently, Destiny 2 is down for maintenance as part of update 8.0.0.5. In total, it will take approximately four hours to complete the maintenance, and the official timeline is:</p>



<ul>
<li>6:00 AM PDT — Destiny 2 maintenance begins; sign-on and game integration features unavailable.</li>



<li>6:45 AM PDT — Destiny 2 was completely brought offline for maintenance, and players were removed from online activities.</li>



<li>10:00 AM PDT — Destiny 2 update is available on all platforms and regions. Players may log back into Destiny 2, and queue times may increase as a result.</li>



<li>12:00 PM PDT — Destiny 2 maintenance concludes, and console players should reset their systems to download the update.</li>
</ul>

I am glad to be here today.”</p><p><strong>Let’s talk first about the game’s story. Can you share more details about the origins of the strange Mud that has spread all over the world and how it shaped the last city of mankind known as <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a>swell?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Let us find the answer in the game.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hmm, OK. So who are the Bladers, and what went into their creation?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “The Bladers are the only ‘life force’ symbols of the wasteland. I hope their appearance can reflect this idea. They should be vivid and bright, yet not disconnected from the desolation and decay of the wasteland city. Take, for example, Arrisa, our protagonist. She originally had long, bright pink hair in the early designs. As we delved deeper into the game’s world and developed more details, we realized that as a Blader who has spent years crawling and fighting, her appearance should reflect her athleticism more. Therefore, Arrisa now sports cool, short, light pink hair (not white!). Her attire has also evolved from exquisite tailoring to a more post-apocalyptic mix-and-match style, reflecting the limited fashion choices in the barren wasteland.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you tell us about the “wide variety and number of weapons” players will have access to? How many or what kind of weapons can players look forward to?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “The game has approximately 20 to 30 types of weapons in total. The variety of weapons provides different combat styles and pacing, making combat experiences more diverse. Few of them have been in the previous trailer released on Jananuary 19. For example, the Straight Sword is an all-round weapon with balanced features. The Double Swords are a fast, aggressive attacker. We will disclose more weapons in the future, such as the scythe and Tachi.”</p><p><strong>How does the transformation mechanism in the Blader’s left hand affect combat strategies?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Arrisa’s left hand can use special Blader’s abilities, such as Spells and skills. Spells, skills, and weapons combined will bring countless fighting styles for players to try. For example, the skill ‘Counter Field’ is similar to ‘parrying.’ It can neutralize enemies’ attacks and then initiate a counterattack. Another skill, ‘Piercing Claw,’ enhances Arrisa’s rage for a more powerful attack upon enemies. There is also a laser-like spell that allows Arrisa to perform long-range attacks to handle different scenarios. These are just a small sample of the skills and spells available. Players will have a wide range of choices to create their own fighting style. If you are interested in seeing more in the future, check our <a href="https://twitter.com/ailimit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X account</a>.”</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the game’s synchronization system and what role it plays in combat?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Sync Rate replaces the Stamina in Soulslike games. This change encourages players to focus more on their quick thinking and adaptability in combat.”</p><p>(<strong>Editor’s Note:</strong> We asked for further clarification on the Sync Rate system—what it is and how it encourages players to focus more on “quick thinking and adaptability” when compared to the Stamina system seen in other Soulslike games—but a public relations representative interjected to clarify that more information will be shared in the leadup to the game’s launch.)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Is combat slow and tactical, or fast and combo-based? If you could compare it to any existing game systems, what would be the closest match?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “On combat pacing, Arrisa is more agile compared to your average cursed undead in <em>Dark Souls</em>, yet more grounded compared to fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [1,959 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>. It’s roughly positioned between <em>Dark Souls III</em> and <em><a title="Games > Bloodborne [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a></em>, although individual experiences may vary. Overall, the action performance is quite agile, and the cancellation of recovery animations and aimed stop have been adjusted to a more lenient degree. We hope that players will not feel overwhelmed by enemies in terms of basic attributes, and that the confrontations with enemies will return to a test of skill and mentality.”</p><p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the game’s variety of enemies and the process behind designing them?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Because Arrisa, the protagonist, has relatively strong combat abilities compared to other Soulslike games, we have also designed equally capable enemies. Take the Necros, one of the enemy factions in the game, as an example. Necro is a general term for a type of monster that wreaks havoc throughout the city. Their signatures include spikes, blades, tentacles, silver shells, and insect-like wings, symbolizing chaos and slaughter.”</p><p><strong>Are enemies unique in that different strategies are required to defeat different foes?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Please allow me to continue use Necros as an example. They possess overwhelming strength. Some move with swift and eerie agility, making them elusive and hard to predict. Others have sharp claws and blades that not only deal damage but also inflict very troublesome status effects. Some can harness extremely dense energy to create explosions and rays… Even with enhanced mobility, the onslaught of Necros is by no means easy for players to withstand. Only by leveraging all resources and mastering every aspect of the combat system can one hope to survive this rebellious wasteland.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>How does the narrative integrate into the game? Are there cutscenes and story-focused elements, or is the story mostly told through world interaction?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “<em>AI LIMIT</em> focused more on gameplay rather than cinematic elements. The game doesn’t have too many ‘force you to watch’ sections. Even if players don’t talk to NPCs at all, they can still beat the game. However, interacting with NPCs allows you to make choices that determine the direction of the story. I hope the different endings provide you with meaningful experiences.”</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge the development team faced during the game’s development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “For a first-time developer, the complexity of the entire project exceeded our expectations. The further we progressed; the more technical issues arose. At certain points in development, iterating on technology caused challenges with maintenance and <a title="Genres > Management [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>. Looking back, we recognize that many of these issues stemmed from our lack of experience as first-timers. However, all of that is now in the past. We believe the game will soon be ready to see the world.”</p><p><strong>How has being part of the China Hero Project program benefitted development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “<a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,853 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> offers project management advice and opportunities for market exposure and brand promotion, which are very important to us. Sony Interactive Entertainment also provides middleware, QA, and sound support, plus consulting from <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,383 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios, all for free. I deeply appreciate it.”</p><p><strong>Outside of publishing the game, how did <a title="Companies > CE-Asia [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ce-asia">CE-Asia</a> help support development?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “As the publisher, CE-Asia has provided us with extensive support, including financial backing, marketing, quality assurance, and improvement advice. They are currently managing the global distribution for both console and PC versions of the game, ensuring it gets rated worldwide. Additionally, they are showcasing our game at gaming exhibitions in different regions. Thanks to their assistance, my team can focus on game development.</p><p>“I would also like to extend special thanks to Mr. Wu, the CEO of CE-Asia. With over twenty years of experience in the gaming industry, he has a wealth of knowledge. During our collaboration, he has identified many issues we hadn’t considered, helping our team avoid numerous pitfalls and ensuring the smooth progress of our development work.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AI-LIMIT-Interview_June-2024_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What aspects of the game are you proudest of? What do you hope players will take away after their time with the game?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “To make the fictional world of <em>AI LIMIT</em> more convincing, we put a lot of effort into building this world. We ensured that the content in the game reflects the setting and enhances the player’s immersion. Vegetation is usually used to fill in scene details for the game. However, in <em>AI LIMIT</em>, vegetation has gone extinct, so this method could not be used. We came up with other ways to construct the scenes. Although it was quite challenging, we persevered and made it work.”</p><p><strong>Did any other titles serve as an inspiration for <em>AI LIMIT</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “It is hard to point out one game as the main inspiration. However, I drew a lot of inspiration from classic Japanese works such as <em>GHOST IN THE SHELL</em>, <em>BLAME!</em>, and <em>AKIRA</em>. Additionally, I incorporated some interesting designs into the game.”</p><p><strong>Before we sign off, is there anything you would like to say to players looking forward to <em>AI LIMIT</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Yang Bin:</strong> “Thank you all for your love for <em>AI LIMIT</em>! The <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,586 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with Arrisa to Havenswell awaits. I hope you will enjoy this game. Stay tuned!”</p><p><strong>Thank you so much for your time, Yang Bin!</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Thirsty Suitors,&nbsp;a story-driven turn-based RPG about a woman battling her various exes (to the chagrin of her disapproving parents), launched last November.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC yet hovers at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">Mixed</a> in the blood-encrusted annals of the Steam user review consensus. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">wrote earlier in the week</a>, a portion of the negative feedback is aimed at the expansion's difficulty, which is certainly a Thing To Hear after years of being told by kindly gamers that I only hand out low review scores because I can't press the buttons in the right order.</p>
<p>As publishers Bandai Namco have <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043">sweetly observed</a>, struggling players are perhaps forgetting that you can raise your overall power level by gathering Scadutree Fragments, a system of collectibles designed to ensure a tough challenge even for endgame players, while giving you the option of effectively rebalancing the expansion through exploration. The downside there, as a few people have pointed out, is that some players don't want to hunt for collectibles before they can topple the bosses.</p><!--more-->
<p>Here to save the day and reconcile the warring parties are the modders and in particular, Sereenaty, whose <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5263?tab=description">Normalized DLC damage</a> mod (thanks, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/elden-ring-mod-remove-shadow-of-erdtree-scadutree-system">VG247</a>) adjusts damage dealt and received within the DLC areas to be more in line with the base game, theoretically doing away with the need for Scadutree Fragments. As the modder sums up, "if you're tired of having your entire build thrown in the Trash just because you're not into collectibles, this mod is for you". The mod also swaps out the bulk of the game's Scadutree Fragments for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-great-runes-divine-towers">Rune Arcs</a>, though you'll apparently still receive a few Fragments from enemy drops.</p>
<p>My schadenfreude about the internet's git-gudders being hoisted by their own quote-dunks aside, I don't have a magic disappearing goat in this particular Elden horse race. I haven't played Shadow Of The Erdtree yet, partly because a lot of people at the Treehouse are already playing it and partly because I'm more interested these days in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lxd-red-honey-is-an-astonishingly-good-free-metroidvania-that-owes-something-to-psychedelic-bees">psychedelic bee products</a>. Still, I'm interested in the angle that searching for Fragments in Erdtree is a chore you must undertake if you want to make headway, and how that differs from the experience of levelling a character by gathering runes. If you're playing, I'm keen to know whether you feel like you're being forced to search for them, or whether discovering them is coming about as part of routine exploration, which is the major thrill of any From Software game for me.</p>
<p>People who don't want to mod Erdtree and also don't want to be speared and barbecued by any given foe should definitely check out our guides section. Ollie, Kiera and Jeremy have put together <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragment-locations">a list of all 50 Scadutree Fragments and their locations</a>. They also strongly recommend that you <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-order">fight Erdtree's bosses in this order</a>. Forget modders - guides writers are the true champions of the realm. They git gud only to ensure that we might git gud in turn.</p>

BioWare has been focusing a lot of its marketing push for the sequel on the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">party of seven heroes</a></span>, each of whom embodies a different faction within the universe and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-veilguard-romance-options-dreadwolf-1851524102">will be a romance option</a></span>. But where will these new characters fall in the pantheon of the series? <em>Dragon Age</em>’s companions are arguably the most well-regarded thing about the franchise, as is pretty standard for BioWare games. It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age </em>game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games. Here’s our ranking of the <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>party members and advisors, from worst to best.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-recommend-id="image://7e89cbc89a87380ff3088f7113cba793" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor sits with Cole." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It is incredibly fitting that Cole, the spirit of compassion who can join the Inquisition, has the ability to make people forget about him, because that dude is unfortunately a pretty forgettable guy. Cole is by no means a bad character, but his story doesn’t quite live up to the highs of his peers. Cole’s existence as something in between a spirit and a human, and how he chooses to lean into one path or the other, creates some interesting routes for the character, but it ultimately hits with the same fervor as a fairly forgettable side quest. He’s good! He’s just unremarkable against the competition.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-recommend-id="image://36e2fd3f021f80462e7726cec732e082" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Josephine and the Inquisitor sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Josephine Montilyet is the only advisor in <em>Inquisition </em>who fans didn’t have an established relationship with prior to the 2014 RPG, and she still managed to carve out her place in their hearts. As the Inquisition’s resident diplomat, Josie is always thinking practically where Cullen might send soldiers to handle a problem and Leliana would cut its throat. As her story unfolds, it’s revealed that the most buttoned-up character in Skyhold has a bit of a wild side, but is still a fan of the finer things in life, like theater and team base gossip. Despite her political expertise, Josie is one of the most grounded, charismatic characters in <em>Inquisition</em>. Her story isn’t about some massive faction or world-shattering event, it’s about a girl who is trying to make sense of a world where dragons roam and people can shoot fire from their hands.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-recommend-id="image://404bf891c97b201206747327b81ee4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor talks to Sera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sera, the elven rogue and Friend of Red Jenny, is an acquired taste. She’s impulsive, disruptive, and judgemental, but she is a product of the world she’s been raised in. As a city elf, Sera has seen the worst of how Thedas treats elves and anyone who isn’t seen as part of the upper class. She’s rebellious and pursues her idea of justice with reckless abandon. That means she’s also a source of tension and drama as she butts heads with anyone who doesn’t fit her idea of what elves should be. Sera is thorny but that’s what makes her delightful when you get closer to her, letting you look past the manic angst and see someone who wants things to be better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-recommend-id="image://ef1a71b3e3e3f1130af166f01ddb0e5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cullen has a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As one of the few characters to appear in every <em>Dragon Age</em> game, Cullen’s role as one of the three advisors in <em>Inquisition</em> is the culmination of every story we’ve seen him pass through. This is a man who started out dedicated to the church and his calling as a mage-fighting Templar just to watch it fail him and others time and time again. Like several other characters in <em>Inquisition</em>, Cullen reckons with who he is after the systems he bought into have fallen apart. Depending on the player’s actions, he can grow from all he’s endured in <em>Origins </em>and <em>Dragon Age II</em>, or he can succumb to the rot the church put inside him. He’s an effective symbol for the failing systems of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, and an excellent reminder that its people and the world they live in are not beyond saving.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-recommend-id="image://8df21af234d8960e6954e9134d5e431d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varic looks up at the sky with fire behind him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At this point, Varric has become a face for the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, if not <em>the </em>face after appearing prominently in three games. I have a lot of love for the dwarven storyteller, but I think my appreciation for his story in <em>Inquisition </em>has only grown stronger after seeing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-varric-bianca-solas-1851533383">some of the payoff in <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>. Varric has gone from a simple roguish businessman in Kirkwall to a storyteller recanting some of the biggest moments in history to anyone who will listen. He has become so world-weary by the time of <em>Inquisition </em>but he’s never lost hope. His personal questline isn’t world-shattering, but it’s a reminder that this man has been dragged through unprecedented times, and will continue to be so as we head into <em>The Veilguard </em>this fall. He deserves rest. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">I hope he gets it</a></span>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-recommend-id="image://bd874b518ccf1a6ae08ebf9b2e54e516" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leliana talks to the Inquisitor.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The return of Leliana, a companion in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, as an advisor in <em>Inquisition</em> was (and remains) controversial given that her appearance seemingly overwrote decisions the player made in the first game. Some of this was explained retroactively through epilogues, but those did little to alleviate feelings of the spymaster being one of BioWare’s seemingly unkillable favorites. Though she serves as a case study in <em>Dragon Age</em>’s complicated relationship with continuity, Leliana’s story in <em>Inquisition</em>, much like Cullen’s, shows one of the few mainstays of each <em>Dragon Age </em>game finally becoming who they were always meant to be. After saving the world once, Leliana has gone from the once soft-spoken bard to a cunning agent of the Inquisition. She is disenfranchised from the church, but not the people she served alongside. She has the potential to become the leader of the church within the <em>Dragon Age</em> universe, and depending on whether you push her to remain compassionate or steel herself, her reign can be paved with kindness or blood. <em>Inquisition </em>is all about watching the world change and seeing the people who make it happen become who they’re supposed to be, and despite the series-wide complications, Leliana shines once more in her third appearance.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-recommend-id="image://f09b5648df12e5c1503ed768e5f14e9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Bull looks down at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There have been a lot of Qunari throughout the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but none have made an impression quite like Iron Bull. The mercenary is a double agent, but he’s refreshingly upfront about it when you meet him. He’s a fun-loving warrior who likes to drink, kill dragons, bro about with his team, and fuck. But despite his seemingly one-track mind, Iron Bull is one of the only characters who can actually betray you if you give him a reason to. Depending on your choices in the main game, Iron Bull may turn on you during the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC with seemingly no remorse; even if you’ve entered a romantic relationship with him. The Qunari spy told you who he was, and he will still be that by the end if you don’t give him a reason to be anyone else. You can’t judge a book by its cover, even if the title on the spine tells you everything you need to know.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-recommend-id="image://c63d215acba3dc12ea49fc6f1a277e31" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Blackwall looks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Blackwall, or a man going by that name, is one of the most slept-on characters in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>. He is initially believed to be a Grey Warden sent to find people to join their Darkspawn-killing ranks. It turns out, however, that he’s not a Warden at all, but a man named Thom Rainer who took on the name after the true Warden Blackwall recruited and was then killed protecting him. Rainer, believing his life otherwise forfeit, assumed Blackwall’s identity and strove to continue his work as a Warden. But in taking another man’s identity, he sought to erase his own, including his past crimes and treachery. As the guilt of his past failings catches up to him, Blackwall’s story can go multiple ways. He can accept his punishment, be given to the Wardens, or be given freedom to atone without hiding. A lot of those big reveals have gone unnoticed by fans because they’re buried under a story that feels like that of a pretty standard, overly stoic fantasy RPG warrior. Once all is said and done, though, Blackwall’s story is a pretty damn effective tale of owning up to one’s mistakes, and proudly being better.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-recommend-id="image://ea101f793c2e7bc009a940b8d3007d4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vivienne stands in front of red lyrium." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame that Vivienne, one of the only mages who isn’t opposed to the Circle of Magi, the mage prison masquerading as a school in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, wasn’t in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, the game that had the war between mages and their Templar keepers at the center of its story. As much as I disagree with Vivienne’s beliefs on a fundamental level, I can’t help but be drawn in by the nuance. Vivienne is a mage who fully admits that she and people like her are dangerous, and a system like the Circle could probably alleviate everyone’s problems, but not in its current form. Whereas <em>Dragon Age II</em> paints mages as an oppressed class of people (while also simultaneously believing that they are inevitably going to become threats to society no matter what you do), Vivienne’s view of the situation is far more complex, and it makes you wonder if the catastrophic events of <em>Dragon Age II</em> might have gone very differently if only someone like her had been in Kirkwall. As a person who plays a mage in all of these games, hearing her condescend to me when I say mages should be free still feels like a particularly bad case of tinnitus, but she at least is talking more sensibly about the situation than anyone else in the room, all while having to shoulder her own personal burdens. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s inability to sit with that nuance has been the undoing of a lot of its world-building. It needed a character like Vivienne two games ago.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-recommend-id="image://f1c1ca9ac2268cc7d016d91dc1c0a0ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cassandra talks to a corrupted Seeker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Religious upheaval is a central theme of <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and no companion embodies that more than Cassandra. She’s the first character the Inquisitor gets in their party, and she is immediately suspicious of you. As far as she can tell, you are a symbol of everything she knows of the world changing. If you’re unwilling to play along with her worldview, any potential friendship between the two of you can sour almost immediately. How is she supposed to support the Inquisition when the person at its center is a heretic? Her reckoning only unravels further as she learns that the organization she has followed for most of her life has been corrupt, oppressing mages in ways deemed inhumane by even <em>Dragon Age </em>standards. Cassandra is one of the most devout people we’ve met in a series full of radicals, and yet while she struggles with the truths laid before her, she doesn’t shy away from them in the end. It would be so easy for a weaker person to retreat, deny the truth, and become stagnant. Cassandra watches the world change and decides to change with it.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-recommend-id="image://7712dbbf438a04f6bfa5b28e50705c5a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solas removes the Inquisitor's hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At first, Solas is one of the less remarkable characters in <em>Inquisition</em>’s roster. He’s characterized by his knowledge of Fade-related magic, has some cool hat tricks to show you in his early conversations, and altogether seems a bit smug and judgy. Things start to change, though, as he reveals he is the source of Big Bad Corypheus’ magic. He shows frustration with the ways of the modern world, his personal quests solidify and reinforce his anger at how flippantly people view spirits, and when all is said and done, he leaves the Inquisition without a word. Then it’s revealed why Solas feels like a person out of time: He is the Dread Wolf, an elven trickster god having awoken to find himself written in history as a traitor to his people. Solas reveals in <em>Trespasser </em>that he barely viewed his friends in the Inquisition as people, and was using them to further his plan to tear down the Veil that separates the real world from the spirit one and bring back the elves’ long-lost immortality. That all changed as he grew to care for the friends he made along the way, but his mission can’t bend to newfound sentimentality. Underneath Solas’ pompous exterior is a man ravaged by guilt for what he did several millennia ago. Should he succeed in tearing down the Veil he created, that guilt will be replaced with a new one as he watches the world burn to correct his mistake. We’ll see what happens in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but <em>Inquisition </em>sets him up as the most compelling antagonist the series has ever put forth.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-recommend-id="image://d9de42a45f494af809f226f239bcf7c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dorin smirks at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Throughout <em>Dragon Age</em>, the land of the Tevinter Imperium has been almost exclusively framed as a culturally homogenous, villainous place where mages rule without opposition, slavery is commonplace, and unspeakable evils made it the origin point of one of the Blight, one of the most ruinous phenomenon in the universe. Most of our frame of reference is from characters who were suffering at the ground level, at least until Dorian Pavus struts into view in <em>Inquisition</em>. By all accounts, Dorian should be thrilled with his setup in Tevinter. He’s the son of a powerful family, has been given every resource to nurture his magical talents, and is pretty much guaranteed a spot at the top of the country’s politics. But he is also his own man, and does not wish to cave to the life his family envisions for him. That includes standing proud as a gay man unwilling to continue his family’s bloodline, even as he is threatened with a magical take on conversion therapy at the hands of his own father.</p><p>Dorian escapes his home in Tevinter and is clearly jaded by the time he meets the Inquisitor. But as he watches the world change before him, how can he view his home country that, despite everything, he still loves? The <em>Dragon Age </em>series has often fallen into cynical cycles of scorching the earth, as if it can’t conceive of a better option. Dorian Pavus has been put through hell and back in Tevinter. He could have easily been a cautionary tale for how his home country is just as terrible as everyone in the series has ever told us. But instead, he’s a shining beacon proclaiming that it doesn’t have to be this way. Whether or not Dorian shows up in <em>The Veilguard</em>, which takes place partially in Tevinter, remains to be seen, but in <em>Inquistion</em>, he is radical hope personified. He is living, breathing proof that history is defined by those who believe that a better world is possible.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Walking into a Walmart or Target and seeing the game section made up almost exclusively of download codes makes my gamer spirit cry out in anguish. By the same token, any time a physical edition of a new game or an old classic gets announced I get a warm, fuzzy feeling inside again. Limited Run Games recently held a showcase that announced a bunch of physical editions for all types of games, including the tragically ill-fated, one-of-a-kind PlayStation 1 sequel: <em>Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return</em>.<br></p><p>During a 30 minute presentation, the Embracer-owned boutique distribution label Limited Run Games announced 26 upcoming releases it will be manufacturing discs and cartridges for, including some that were remastered  using its own proprietary Carbon Engine for layering retro emulation. I have no idea if works well or not, but I hope it means they got the love, attention, and respect they deserved. </p><p>There wasn’t a whole lot of information on pricing or release dates for some of the physical editions, but it’s still a nice heads-up. Now anyone who wants a physical copy can hold out for when those become available instead of double-dipping with the digital version too. After all, fans have waited decades for some of these games. What’s a few more months (or god forbid, years). </p><p>  <em>Tomba! 2</em> was the highlight, for sure. Joining Limited Run’s previously announced physical edition for the first <em>Tomba!</em>, the sequel brought the colorful PS1 platformer into a hybrid world of linear paths and 3D environments. It was a bold experiment that left the team behind it, Whoopee Camp, shuttered following its lackluster sales, though creator Tokuro Fujiwara recently directed the 2021 nostalgia trip <em>Ghosts ‘n Goblins Resurrection </em>and has provided his blessing to <em>Tomba!</em>’s return. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-recommend-id="image://b2b96df6601906d4702a45f73a7131a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Penny rides a yo-yo in Penny's Big Breakaway.

When will these updates come? "[Solo mode] will be improved once we improve this feature," head of community and global brand director Almir Listo said in a developer update <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r26hIijRoRo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature.</p></div><p>"It's not our full vision for this feature," he began. "For now, we're setting it as a beta to see how it runs. We expect the performance to be affected since the parts normally frontloaded by our servers will now have to be run on your own hardware.</p><p>"It will work though, and you can get progression that will update you once you return online. You will still be required to start the game while online in Solo Mode, which will be improved once we improve this feature.

"We are so sorry that the infrastructure didn't hold up as expected, and although it's impossible to prepare for every scenario — we should be able to do better," he said (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starbreeze-ceo-out-after-payday-3-disaster">but has now left the company</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-lack-of-communication-as-mid-october-first-patch-still-a-no-show">Almost a month after its launch and Starbreeze apologised again</a> for its lack of communication, and then just a week later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/payday-3-dev-apologises-for-radio-silence-explains-mia-first-patch">said sorry one more time for not delivering a promised patch</a> and again going quiet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/supervive-nee-project-loki-first-preview-a-bold-new-battle-royale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>From the outside looking in, Supervive looks like many a top-down, twin-stick style shooter you may see on any given digital game store. It only takes a couple minutes after dropping into its massive battle royale-style map to see that it does more than just look like a beautifully modeled and animated computer action game you’ve might be familiar with, but it combines elements of many games from many genres to create a battle royale that is wholly unique, with a surprising amount to learn and do in each session outside of surviving against other teams. Clashes against enemies are frantic thanks to the big emphasis on fast and varied styles of movement and cleverly designed characters with abilities that interact with each other and their surroundings in far more interesting ways than just dealing damage.</p><p>These so-called Hunters are really the first place where I was particularly wowed by Supervive. Of the 14 that were available to me, all had completely different gameplans for success in battle than each other. Some characters were pretty obviously weird out of the gate, like this black hole-slinging crowd controller, but even ones that would be relatively straightforward in any other game had a feature that made them really pop. Huntress, for example, is the bow-wielder, meaning she has attacks you’d expect from this archetype – like being able to shoot a big arrow at longer range or a fan of arrows in a zone in front of you. But she can also move through walls like an X-Man, making her far more elusive than you might expect for a character that has to take extra time to aim relatively slow shots.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Supervive - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Support or utility-focused hunters are highly effective during combat in active ways. Pushing enemies around with a rapidly expanding wall or dashing to fallen comrades to rescue them from execution are just some of the small ways Supervive refreshes a role that is usually more passive. In fact, no matter who you choose, be it a spry ranged shooter or a front-line face-puncher, you’ll have some sort of movement and displacement ability, meaning you can always reposition to avoid enemy attacks or directly disrupt opponents. Seamless movement around the map and into, out of, and through combat mixed with the many ways you can abruptly move your foes out of position, into walls, or even one another, makes this game play so noticeably different than other tactical games like League of Legends or Battlerite that it takes plenty of inspiration from. You can be elusive and aggressive all in the same motion, which feels more like fighting game shenanigans than would be typical in a shooter like this. Most characters don’t have to wait for the right opening, they can make one themselves.</p><p>Before you even get to open combat with enemies, you’ll likely have to find them first. Supervive’s huge map is dense with regions that are hiding treasures within them. In the sessions I had, after choosing a location on the map and dropping, there was always a small recon period where we had to check our surroundings for opportunities to get loot or experience. Our first few encounters were usually with groups of NPC monsters that either roamed around locations or were camped out around corners waiting for unsuspecting players. Rarely were these monsters more than a nuisance on their own, but higher-level bosses can test your team's power, and any mob camp that gets wedged between a fight between enemy teams can often be a consequential factor in them.  The map has a day and night cycle that makes monsters appear more frequently at night and levels them up in the morning, making longer games that much more dangerous in theory. In practice, they were rarely more than just ways to keep above the loot and level curve without killing other players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When you aren’t trouncing the local wildlife, you can also find some important points of interest on the map that can be super valuable. Bonfires are early game hubs that allow you to repair your shields and upgrade items. When wandering the map, you can also return to them with the press of a button to regroup. Vaults were often a top priority too, as they held top-tier gear, so long as you could survive the test they’d spring on you to unlock them. Passive gear can be a bit confusing without putting a lot of reps into Supervive to figure out the best stat combos for your character (or getting advice from developers like I did). Active gear can come in many forms like building walls that only your squad can shoot through, summoning critters to do your bidding, or creating a giant cannon that rolls out giant cats whose purpose is yet to be determined. I really liked finding a new item and obsessing over it through the course of a match, but that's another thing that's hard to optimize without many matches under your belt.</p><p>The map itself, besides being filled with a smattering of different environments like desert sands, dilapidated ruins, and snowy hills, is broken up into islands separated by gorges that will lead to your death should you fall down them. When exploring, they’re a cinch to navigate thanks to a glider with a generous float time. A simple double jump feels like an Evel Knievel stunt when enemies are around, as one touch from them will send you crashing out of the air and into oblivion. When you’re downed on solid ground, you’re turned into a wisp as you await either revival or a more concrete death, and though you can’t be harmed by enemy attacks, you can be shoved around, making you an easy target for being kicked off of ledges. Lots of fights either start as one team attempts to strategically fly onto a landmass while another hogs the edges to keep them away, and many fights end with one team attempting to shove another into the void. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A simple double jump feels like an Evel Knievel stunt when enemies are around, as one touch from them will send you crashing out of the air and into oblivion. </p></div><p>This, mixed with the maps being littered with walls and multi-level plateaus meant that simply strafing around one another in a  pitched battle on even ground was more rare than pushing each other into obstacles and using them as tactical opportunities to pick each other off. It was very uncommon to see two or more teams tussle without any members of each side getting picked off. Getting killed was a pretty common occurrence, but there are so many ways to get revived that I never felt like I was condemned to twiddle my thumbs and watch the rest of the game for very long. This always meant that if you left even a single member of a team standing, that they were a team-reviving beacon or Most Wanted Takedown away from putting their whole team back on the map and evening the odds. For me, a person who is generally pretty average at battle royales, this was a great and forgiving way to give me as many chances as possible to redeem myself.</p><p>I had tons of fun with my hands-on time, but I couldn’t stop a question from nagging me in the background of all the chaos: is yet another live service game dead on arrival, regardless of how good it is? I asked CEO Joe Tung if the wild mood swings of the games industry is an existential threat to Theorycraft’s ambitions with Supervive. “It is absolutely an existential fear,” he replied. “And I think if anyone answers that they aren’t afraid of that, they must have a reality distortion field I don’t have.” He admits that this is a difficult time to release a game, especially in a free-to-play, games as a service business model that is becoming more and more crowded by the quarter. But in the face of lots of hard to predict externalities that they can’t control, Joe feels that Theroycraft has positioned themselves from day one to weather as many storms as the world throws at them. He credits the timing in which they raised money - late 2020-through 2021 when investors were more willing to spend of prospects - and committing to a fully remote team as a way to court the best talent he could find as part of the strategy that gives them a lot of extra runway to make sure they land this plane, even if it’s not a runaway success immediately.</p><p>With only an hour or so of rounds under my belt, I still have a lot to learn about Supervive. It’s a battle royale full of ideas, and some of the inspirations are pretty easy to identify - many games like it have big maps with hotspots worth fighting over for high level loot. But when it innovates on its own, like with its roster of dynamic and expressive characters, and lots of tactical options presented by its exciting movement system and roster of active and passive items, there’s no game quite like it. If you’re an Apex Legends fan who loves the unique flavor individual characters bring to a standard FPS, an Overwatch fan who loves objective-heavy team play, or a League of Legends fan who values tactics in their team-based skirmishing, you might want to spend some time with Supervive’s first big open playtest, running now until July 7th. You might be as surprised as I was to find so many core concepts of seeminging unalike games meld so well in one colorful package.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Look for it to arrive on September 24.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/02/21/everything-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">first revealed</a> during a Nintendo Partner Direct in February. The remake is being handled by developer Purple Lamp and features reworked gameplay (the original was played with Wii motion controls, after all), new brush abilities for Mickey, and a graphical upgrade. A new trailer features a chat with the game's original creative director Warren Spector, who is also involved with this remake, to reveal Rebrushed's Collector's Edition.</p>

<p>For $199.99, this special box is available for pre-order now and includes the following items:</p>

<p>If you missed the original game, it sees Mickey explore a fantasy world called the Wasteland filled with obscure Disney characters, namely antagonist Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Disney's original animation star who predates Mickey Mouse. The Wasteland has been taken over by an entity called the Blot, which Mickey accidentally unleashed and must now stop. The 3D action platformer sees Mickey wielding a magic paintbrush that can create new objects while erasing others, and Mickey's actions shape his destiny and the game's story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. You can read our review of the original Epic Mickey <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/disney_epic_mickey/b/wii/archive/2010/11/29/review.aspx">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The Ubisoft of the early 2000s was a very different beast to the company that we know today. Before the open world sprawls of Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry, it was Rayman, Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia that were the company’s cornerstone releases. And then there was Beyond Good &amp; Evil. A critical darling that struggled commercially, it built up a committed fanbase that elevated the game to a cult level. The 2011 remaster for PS3 and Xbox 360 performed much better, such that both the 2008 and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/12/beyond-good-evil-2-returns-as-a-prequel-adventure/">2017 sequel announcements</a> sparked momentary optimism, but the long stretches of silence have turned Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2’s development into a meme and the series has felt doomed to become a relic of the past. Still, a 20th anniversary is as good a reason as any to dust off an old classic and revisit the good old days.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaU4tMuvvdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Returning to the world of Hillys inevitable involves a huge amount of nostalgia for me, so wrapped up is this game in my memories of venturing out into the world after graduating from university. Lifting the rose tinted specs to appreciate the game in a wider context, it’s clear that Ubisoft has kept the remaster pretty restrained, while making some necessary quality of life improvements to aid a modern audience and adding a few extras and bonuses for the longtime fans.</p>


<p>Assuming you are not familiar with the game already, BG&amp;E tells the story of a young reporter, Jade, and her attempts to unravel the mysteries and conspiracies behind a sinister alien invasion of her adopted home planet. This planet is populated by a mixture of species from standard homo sapiens to humanoid sharks. Jade herself lives on a lighthouse island and acts as a foster mother of sorts to a group of orphaned children alongside her Uncle Pey’j, who just happens to be a boar. When Jade’s home is threatened and attacked by aliens, she is caught up in an adventure that traverses the land eventually takes her to the moon.</p>


<p>BG&amp;E was always a game that benefited from its striking visual design rather than extreme graphical fidelity. I was worried that the remaster would lose this aesthetic and go for a more heavy-handed approach, but fortunately it has retained the feel and style of the game and produced an update that looks like my memories of the game, rather than the somewhat more jagged reality of 2003. Similarly, the soundtrack has been refreshed and rerecorded by a live orchestra, but not changed. The result is stunning and I’ll be adding it to my gaming playlist.</p>
<p>In terms of genre, BG&amp;E takes inspiration from action adventures such as classic Zelda and incorporates vehicle traversal and stealth sections into the mix. It feels like a game that predicts the open world sprawl of so many contemporary titles, but reins in the scale to still feel intimate and meaningful. The map is relatively small, but it’s packed with secrets and hidden areas that really reward exploration for completionists.</p>

<p>The controls have been remapped to be more in keeping with modern titles and I found them to be smooth and responsive on PS5. Perhaps the most important improvement is the introduction of an invert option for all game modes, solving one of the biggest complaints the original game faced. The fantastic ring-based keyboard is retained and still feels head and shoulders above all other methods of text entry on controller.</p>
<p>Dating from the golden age of single player adventures, BG&amp;E contains no multiplayer, no online components, and no DLC or microtransactions – all aspects that doubtless feed into my nostalgia for it and its era. That isn’t to say that the 20th anniversary version is barebones though, as there is a wealth of behind the scenes content for fans to look through and enjoy. Seeing the changes the game underwent through development is a real bonus for fans and the connections to the long-delayed sequel can perhaps be better understood this way.</p>

<p>Playing through the game now also benefits from the inclusion of auto-saves to avoid frustration at some of the more awkward stealth sections – perhaps the one part of the game that has not aged well. At the other end of the spectrum, truly committed players can try out the speedrun mode that completely disables saves and turns the game into a permadeath challenge. There are also the expected range of achievements that reward exploration and completionists. Most of these are fairly standard, but the ones for finishing a speedrun and for beating the final boss without losing health promise to be major obstacles for those wanting a complete set.</p>
<p>Perhaps most exciting of all, however, is a new treasure hunt questline that seeks to bridge the gap between this game and the characters and setting of the sequel. This is probably the clearest indication that that game is still in development somewhere within Ubisoft, with a touching tribute to its Creative Director, Emile Morel, being included here too.</p>

		Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary really is the best way to play this classic cult title, bringing it up to date in terms of controls, resolutions and more. The underlying game may show its age at times, especially during the enforced stealth sections, but there is so much charm and character here that it deserves a whole new audience.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing everyone's favorite gun-toting heroine Lara Croft into the fold as a survivor.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/lara-croft-in-dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> says, Lara is "among gaming's most formidable - and honorable - heroes", and she's also apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bafta-poll-most-iconic-gaming-character">the most iconic gaming character of all time</a>, so her introduction to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>does make some sense, although&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>&nbsp;isn't much of a horror franchise.</p>
<p>There's no corresponding killer for Lara, so don't expect Jacqueline Natla or Himiko to show up and give her a hard time. That said, she does arrive with three perks to help her stand out from the survivor crowd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=N2EwvaJz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover-jumping-window.jpg?itok=JdBIh9uU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lara Croft has officially joined the cast of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Lara's first perk, Finesse, gives her 20% faster vaults while she's healthy, while her second, Hardened, reveals the Killer's aura for a few seconds instead of Lara screaming. It's activated after unlocking a chest and either cleansing or blessing a totem.</p>
<p>Finally, the Specialist perk gives Lara one token every time she opens or rummages through a chest, up to a maximum of three. When performing a great skill check on generators, the maximum required generator progress is reduced according to the number of tokens Lara's amassed.</p>
<p>Lara Croft is just one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">many characters</a> arriving in&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of its apparent ongoing mission to become the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>of horror games. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-dragons-crossover"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' Vecna</a>, Remedy's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover">hapless writer hero Alan Wake</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-chucky">Chucky from the&nbsp;<em>Child's Play&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>.</p>
