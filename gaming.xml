<h2>Fellowship update patch notes November 6th</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue causing enemies to sometimes desync on their patrol paths – making them invisible to players until they suddenly appeared on top of them. This should resolve the most common situations that caused enemies to become “invisible”.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where “Targeted ground abilities” would sometimes cause the aiming circle to disappear or get centered on your character when the cursor was pointing at a wall or steep slope.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Matchmaking item level requirement adjustments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Adept to 80 (was 60).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Champion to 130 (was 120).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Paragon to 190 (was 180).<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>ITEMS</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with the [Dark Prophecy] set bonus proc so that it no longer triggers on “non-hero” actions, such as emotes and interacting with camp fires.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Ancient Wardstone] relic now provides High Haste and Low Expertise.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Chalice Al’Zerac’s Essence] relic now provides Spirit and Haste.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Meiko’s [Crusader Longcloak] was incorrectly named for two different items.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Vigor’s [Lamellar Helm] was incorrectly set as a pair of gloves.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed various Uncommon and Rare items that had their rarity set incorrectly.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Vendor gear was always set to Common rarity. That gear now correctly reflects the league they are assigned to.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed various item typos.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WEAPONS</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[Fated Strike] hit delay was reduced to 0.15 seconds (was 0.3 seconds) when used in melee range.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Latent Resurgence] trait healing has been increased by 50%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where [Repository of Light] was not properly removed from other players whenever the source died.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>HEROES</b><wbr></p>
<p><b><br>
Helena</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Helena’s health gained from Stamina was increased by 10%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Hold the Line] tooltip was updated to reflect the recent hot fix, causing her Toughness to not be reduced while the absorb from [Empowered Shield Slam] is active on her.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absorb effect from [Empowered Shield Slam] has been renamed to “Empowered Shield Slam: Barrier” (was “Hold the Line”).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bleed from [Sweeping Strikes] now reduces all damage dealt by afflicted enemies by 10% for its duration.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Meiko</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The [Sibling of Earth] from Meiko’s [Twin Souls: Bulwark] now has health equal to Meiko’s max health, increased by 2% for every 1% critical strike, haste, expertise, and spirit she has (was not increased by secondary stats previously).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Shattering Obelisk Drape] (legendary cloak) now accumulates 10% of all damage it takes and pulses it out as damage on intervals (was 18%).<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Note: The [Shattering Obelisk Drape’s] damage accumulation needed to be toned down considering the rather large increase to the [Sibling of Earth’s] health. In overall, the [Shattering Obelist Drape] is dealing more damage now, when taking all the above changes into account.</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Necklace of Tectonic Impact] now increases the damage of the final hit of [Earthfist Barrage] by another 75% when consuming a 2nd charge (was 50% – tooltip stated 60%).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip for [Twin Souls: Bulwark] has been updated to show the resulting max health of the [Sibling of Earth] – and now includes information on new secondary stat scaling of [Sibling of Earth’s] health.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update from last hot fix. Meiko’s description for her Spirit stat has been updated to reflect that the [Spirit Armor] effect she gains upon triggering a [Spirit Refund] now grants 30% more armor (was 50%).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update. Meiko’s [Stone Shield] tooltip has now been updated to match the last hotfix, stating she gains 50% increased Armor for each stone that is active on her (was 35%).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update: Meiko’s [Earthfist Barrage] and [Lashing Stormkick] tooltips now correctly state they cause her to heal for 100% of the damage dealt (the tooltip was incorrectly displaying 150% in one place and 200% in another place).<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sylvie</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The healing of [Fluttercall: Heal] has been increased by 25%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The healing of [Fluttercall: Restore Life] has been increased by 25%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Heartbloom] now accumulates 12% of all Flutterfly Healing (was 15%)<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Flower Power] now causes [Heartbloom] to accumulate 8% of all Flutterfly Healing (was 10%).<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Note: Sylvie’s baseline healing from Flutterflies were a bit lower than intended overall. Heartbloom was toned down slightly to keep its power similar to before.</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enfeebling Rootsap duration was increased to 10 seconds (was 6 seconds).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shields applied by [Safe Haven] and [Ironleaf Ward] when talented into [Natural Protector] have been increased by 200%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Natural Protector’s] shield is now also applied to players that walk into [Safe Haven] after it has been placed. This only works once per player, per cast of [Safe Haven].<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Note: Natural Protector as a 3 point talent was underperforming.</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Life Petal] now has 2 charges and gains Cooldown Acceleration from your Haste.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Nettlebolt] damage was increased by 70%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Prickly Vines] damage was increased by 20%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Sprouting Nettles] PPM was reduced to 2.0 (was 4.0) but now increases the critical strike chance of Nettlebolt by +400%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Symbiosis] now increases [Prickly Vines] damage by 12% for each player that has a Pink Flutterfly active on them.<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[Soulbrand] damage has been increased by 20%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Dawnbreaker Orb] damage has been increased by 35%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Radiant Blast] damage and healing has been increased by 15%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with [Grand Design] talent causing [Rune of Renewal] (when overcharged) to only increase the direct healing by 100% on targets that already had [Rune of Renewal] active, when it should be increasing the direct healing by 200%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip updated for [Levitate]. Movement abilities do not benefit from Cooldown Acceleration based on health. The text has been removed (the ability has not been changed).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Harmonizing Refractions] (Legendary Necklace) now stacks up to 2 times to mitigate situations where 2 procs in a row would cause the first proc to be overwritten and effectively lost.<br>
<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tariq</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Heavy Strike] can no longer be spammed to trigger proc effects. Now only triggers proc effects once the [Heavy Strike] starts its swing.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Bloodied Brass Necklace] legendary now deals 450% of [Face Breaker’s] damage (was 150%), dealt over 24 seconds (was 18 seconds).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bleed from [Bloodied Brass Necklace] can no longer critical strike, and no longer double dips in Damage% bonuses, Expertise, etc.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Ruinharrow Necklace of Spoils] had Strength on it. Now only has Stamina like all necklaces.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ardeos</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue causing the [Engulfing Flames] applied by [Pyromania] to not generate [Cinders].<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>New “Active Ability Timers” added</b><wbr></p>

		<p>Unbeatable is not going to be releasing on November 6th as planned, D-CELL Games have announced just hours before the expected release. The reason for this last moment delay of Unbeatable is the fact that the team ran into a bug that essentially makes the game unreleasable, and it needs to be fixed, which in turn pushes back dates for console certification. The new date chosen is December 9th with that date being chosen as there are fewer other releases around then.</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: FINAL TRAILER " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post on Steam, developer RJ Lake wrote, <em>“Hi! UNBEATABLE was supposed to come out tomorrow! That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: UNBEATABLE will now release on December 9.I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different… the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made).&nbsp; We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and&nbsp;not&nbsp;fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it…We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody. Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a&nbsp;lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.”</em></p>

<p>In Unbeatable you play as Beat, who makes music with her band. The issue is that music is illegal in the world of Unbeatable, so Beat and the crew are on the run. The gameplay is that of a rhythm action game and completing quests while playing music. The story is said to last around 6 to 8 hours, and there will also be an arcade mode which has its own progression system, modifiers, and challenges to beat. The arcade mode will also get additional songs in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-president-says-movies-and-the-like-are-%E2%80%98very-well-suited%E2%80%99-to-nintendo-games.1344994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As usual following <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Nintendo quarterly report</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa and 'Fellow' Shigeru Miyamoto (the man behind Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong, and other Nintendo classics) <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered a series of questions fielded in Japanese by investors</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about the company's growing efforts in film and visual media, Shuntaro Furukawa said that movies are 'very well-suited' to Nintendo games. </p>



<p><em>Following the success of "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," I feel that film and visual media are a form of entertainment very well-suited to our games, and we can make unique proposals in this area as Nintendo. As stated in the earlier presentation, this is a field we aim to actively pursue. Through movies and videos, we want to increase our fanbase, spark renewed interest in our games, and build multigenerational support for Nintendo.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, movies are about story and characters, and the Big N has never really managed to shine as much as Sony in these areas. That said, despite his lack of depth, Mario is still arguably the most popular game character, which paid dividends for <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023's record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Its follow-up, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, is slated to air in theaters <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on April 3, 2026</a>, but the most interesting test will be the upcoming Legend of Zelda live action film, starring Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. While still very popular among gamers, the franchise lacks the same level of mainstream recognition as Mario, and how well it can capture an audience remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Miyamoto-san had a much longer response to the same question, pointing out that this is a 'logical next step' for the game developer, and the new internal movie division is focused on experimentation.</p>



<p><em>Nintendo, as an entertainment company, has created a variety of games, IP, and characters. Thinking about entertainment experiences we can maintain long-term, film production became a logical next step. We used to focus on interactivity, but now aim to extend into more passive experiences like film. Film requires people. But we don’t want Nintendo to become a company that just balloons in headcount. Our strategy was to find partners worldwide for joint projects. Content that resonates globally can be made anywhere and speak to anyone—we are investing accordingly. Today, we talk directly and equally with diverse international production teams and creators, and Nintendo’s own developers are involved as well. On the business side, film operates under established structures. If productions are handled well, they generate profit.</em></p>



<p><em>Nintendo Pictures is less about making movies like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," and more about experimenting with new challenges—making short films, running our own research, and tackling less commercially clear areas. Our short film "Close to you" featuring Pikmin is an example. If these pieces become valuable assets for Nintendo’s content library, we will have succeeded.</em></p>



<p>Earlier today, the Japanese game studio and console manufacturer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed its goal to invest in studio acquisitions</a>.</p>

The news was shared during an interview on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ <em>Las Culturistas </em>podcast<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I don’t know if I can announce this, but I’m just going to. Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and [Cole Escola] is writing it,” said <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> star Lawrence. The actor didn’t reveal any plot details during the interview, but when asked if she and Stone would appear in the film replied: “I think so, we have to.” Comedian and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Escola">Escola</a> has become a big sensation following the release of their hit Broadway play <em>Oh, Mary!&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Disney and The Jim Henson Company have yet to officially announce the <em>Muppets</em> spin-off movie starring Miss Piggy.</p> <p>If the movie actually happens, it would mark the character’s first solo outing since the famous pig debuted on <em>The Muppet Show</em> back in 1976. The Muppets franchise recently celebrated its 70-year anniversary. And in September, it was announced that Seth Rogen was leading the charge on a new <em>Muppet Show</em> reboot.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-muppet-show-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter-pilot-1236546510/">Meanwhile, <em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Disney is working on a Sabrina Carpenter-led <em>Muppets</em> special that is set to air in 2026, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original TV show.</p>

                <p>The cooking game Overcooked is getting adapted into a competition reality series for Netflix, according to a new report. The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported.</a></p><p>The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the report said.</p><p>The series is said to be in the "early stages" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.</p><p>Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. </p><p>A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.</p><p>The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix.

This quest sends you to the Dam Battlegrounds to collect a water sample--but if you don't know where to do so, it can be a bit confusing to figure out. We'll reduce the frustration for you a bit by explaining how to get the water sample.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete this quest, so feel free to jump in with a free loadout if you prefer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nothing-but-respect-for-this-manual-ear-and-nose-hair-trimmer.1344976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning. </figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/football-manager-26-review/">Football Manager 26 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Football Manager review, I wrote, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Last week, Nintendo surprised everybody with an announcement: Over four years after its “<a href="https://youtu.be/aZ3QC8e1_yg?si=xf6L-A2b_nt4OgDX&amp;t=699">last major free content update</a>,” <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is getting a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">Switch 2 upgrade and a free update for all players</a>. It’s not often that an incredibly popular game goes <em>years</em> between updates, but since when has anyone been able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">predict what Nintendo will do</a>?</p></div><p>In 2021, the company was very clear that the 2.0 update would be the game’s last. Slowly but surely, most of us stopped playing, accepting that support for <em>New Horizons</em> had ended. Well, sike, I guess! In preparation for the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition this January, we at <em>The Verge</em> decided to check in on our islands and see what we’ll be coming back to in a few months.</p><p>I’ll admit, I was expecting a much bigger mess. While I haven’t played <em>New Horizons</em> in ages — the villagers tell me it’s been 11 months, though it feels much longer — my kids have jumped into the island periodically during that time. And, just like in real life, they’re slobs in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Yet our island appears mostly intact. There were a few items strewn about, and a shockingly small number of weeds, but not much else to complain about. Mostly, without me to do the gardening, the entire island is now one gigantic field of flowers. It’s beautiful and not at all what I was anticipating. Even more shocking: Both of their houses were tidy. Now if only I could get them to do that in real life. —<em>Andrew Webster</em></p><p>Returning to Isla Ashtra has been a neat exercise in forensically investigating my own brain. After being away for many years — one villager told me it was five years and four months, to be exact — there are some parts of my island where I can clearly see my thought process and other places where I have no idea what the hell I was thinking. I was pleased to see my little pizza shop and fondly remembered the process of remixing mundane items like a hat into a clever pizza display. But, as I continued to explore, I found items discarded randomly about — a crystal ball here, a mirror there — and I simply cannot intuit why they’re there. Maybe I meant to make a tarot shop, or maybe I just needed to free up some inventory space. Who knows? Certainly not me. —<em>Ash Parrish</em></p><p>My island, once populated with lovable neighbors and thoughtful placement of shrubs and amenities, is gone. It has been wiped from existence by its creator, me, in a swift act of negligence while moving data from an original Switch to a Switch 2. I guess I didn’t do something correctly. Oops. Precious erased neighbors, cover your ears for what I’m about to say. I should feel more sad, but I’m not. Maybe I’ll become engrossed in building a new island once the Switch 2 Edition update comes out in January. If I do, I will erect a memorial to you all on it that I hopefully don’t accidentally erase someday. —<em>Cameron Faulkner</em></p><p>My house is perfect, an oasis of organized calm. The kitchen is warm and inviting, espresso maker on the counter beautifully complimenting the totally-not-a-KitchenAid mixer on the sideboard. There are no clothes strewn on the hardwood parquet of my bedroom floor. Upstairs, in the office, there is nothing on my desk except my laptop and a mug of coffee. The bathroom, too, is spotless. If only I could say the same for literally any part of my real home, where my children — now ages 12 and 7 — currently sit on our stained, ratty sofa, fighting over who gets to be the lead player in <em>ACNH</em> today.</p><p>The truth is, my island house is not a home but a fly trapped in amber — a fossil, fixed and unchanging. My daughter was 6 and my son a baby when I first started playing, and back then I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/04/parenting-in-a-pandemic-chaos-control-and-an-animal-crossing-meltdown/">was able to exert some measure of control</a> over the island and, by extension, over anything else at all, in a world gone even madder than average. But really, the world is theirs to inherit, and to remake in their image. And they have done so, with flowers, trees, rocks, and even houses in unexpected, unfamiliar places. The part of me that has learned to make peace with the chaos is allowed to overrule the part of me that craves organization. If only they wouldn’t leave so much crap to trip on lying around on the ground everywhere — in <em>both </em>our worlds. —<em>Kate Cox</em></p><p>I played <em>New Horizons</em> every single day for two years, amounting to what my Switch Lite tells me is over 1,700 hours of time spent on my island. I collected every single item in every single colorway. I unlocked every DIY recipe and, after the 2.0 update, every cooking recipe. My storage is full of spare Nook Miles Tickets and crafting ingredients and rare seasonal items. But my island itself? It’s completely unfinished. The fish market along the southern shore gives way to a vast field of wheat (and artfully placed weeds), and then… nothing. The river lies incomplete and connected to no water source. The museum sits alone at the top of a hill I never finished building. And I’d moved all the villagers’ houses to the beach to keep them out of the way for a construction period that never ended.</p><p>I am so unbelievably excited to have a reason to complete that construction. I’ll see you all in January. —<em>Kallie Plagge</em></p><p>When I last fired up <em>New Horizons </em>three years, 11 months, and (estimating here) a couple of days ago, I had no idea all of the hoops you had to jump through in order to move your island between consoles. I left my island, LilHalcyon, thinking I could always return — even on a new Switch — once I downloaded the game again. <em>Had </em>I heard people telling each other about the importance of backing up your island online and using the Island Transfer Tool? Probably, but I didn’t take that advice to heart. This is how I wound up in a mild panic, confused as to why LilHalcyon wouldn’t load up on my Switch 2. As I sat there looking at Tom Nook in a void of darkness telling me he couldn’t find a backup on my OLED Switch either, I thought something might have gone wrong with the download process and all my villagers had been lost in the ether.</p><p>But then Kallie pointed out that I probably never moved things over from my long-uncharged OG Switch — and she was right. I was relieved to see all of my old buds still knocking around. All of the roaches and weeds were kinda gnarly, but LilHalcyon was still the charming little homestead I remembered. A couple of other villagers speculated that I was a figment of their imaginations who might have never existed in the first place. But I’ve let them all know that reports of my (and our island’s) death have been greatly exaggerated. —<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Verge Staff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/814497/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-2025-return]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-ubisoft-details-its-battle-to-overcome-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%98haters%E2%80%99.1344949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> became a target for right-wing culture warriors ranging from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">random shareholders</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">to Elon Musk</a>. In a recent video shown at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft reportedly tried to take back ownership of the narrative surrounding the attacks and demonstrate a potential playbook for dealing with haters online. How much of it is just spin remains to be seen, but it’s an unusual move for a company that usually shrinks from controversy.</p> <p>The video’s existence <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">was reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, including a partial transcription of what it said and additional comments from CEO Yves Guillemot after it was shown to gaming industry members during an event at the conference. The brief presentation detailed the company’s version of events, positioning the game’s unexpected delay last year as a bold move.</p>

 <p>Instead of shying away from criticisms lobbed from certain corners of the internet that Ubisoft was “virtue signaling” by featuring the story of African samurai Yasuke, it doubled down on polishing the game and highlighting the elements that made it<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. So the theory goes, anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft has stopped sharing sales data with Circana who reports the software &amp; hardware sales in the us.</p> <p>First image the top selling games of 2025 as of June including AC Shadows, second image top selling games of 2025 as of July without Shadows.</p> <p>Mat from Circana confirmed this <a href="https://t.co/4WuKoSgRhP">pic.twitter.com/4WuKoSgRhP</a></p> <p>— JorRaptor (@Jorraptor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“With our allies beside us, we found confidence again: To stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters,” the narrator of the marketing video says, according to <em>Game File</em>. “And by the time<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launched, thanks to our fans, momentum was finally on our side.”</p>

 <p>Guillemot elaborated on the pivot in a conversation afterwards. “We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Game File</em>‘s translation</a>. “And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.”</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ sales figures are in stealth mode</h2> <p>It’s an echo of something the cofounder said shortly after announcing the game’s delay. “I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda,” he told investors last year in an apparent attempt to beat the allegations of the company’s worst critics. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318"><em>Game File</em> also reported</a> that the company canceled an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> set in post-Civil War America over concerns about political unrest.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft did hit back at critics earlier this year. The official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1897048261619540235">dunked on one of the most high-profile social media accounts</a> leading a campaign against the game. But developers working on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly also advised</a> not to post about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ release to avoid becoming a target of the harassment campaign.</p> <p>How has this all worked out for Ubisoft? It’s hard to tell. <em>Shadows</em> was well reviewed at launch and sold well in its first few months. It was the third top-grossing game in the U.S. as of June, but Ubisoft has stopped sharing public sales data in the months since and hasn’t officially confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1960794645308252467%7Ctwgr%5Edbaadbf897184f93beb9cf56c0dee354ed10b92a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">exact sales figures</a>. It must have been happy enough with the results to move ahead with other delays. Ubisoft told investors earlier this year that a slate of unannounced upcoming blockbusters <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">would take longer than expected to ship</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a shocking move, D-CELL GAMES’ Unbeatable has been delayed to early December, with less than 12 hours until its planned launch. As to why the last-minute delay happened, it seems an unreleaseable bug was found and needs to be fixed urgently.</p>



<p>Announced via Kickstarter in 2021, Unbeatable is an anime-inspired rhythm game releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As vocalist Beat, you’ll resist a tyrannical government that outlawed music. With the help of your band, you’ll bring music back to the world via engaging rhythm gameplay. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo for the game</a> was released on PC and PlayStation 5 and was well-received by fans. The game was originally set to release on November 6th, but according to the developer, it won’t launch until December.</p>



<h2 id="h-indie-rhythm-game-unbeatable-gets-last-minute-delay-to-december-9th-2025">Indie Rhythm Game Unbeatable Gets Last-Minute Delay to December 9th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a developer post on Steam</a>, RJ Lake, one of the game’s directors, announced that Unbeatable is now coming out on December 9th, 2025. The game was expected to launch in less than 12 hours, so the delay is very last-minute. As to why, the team cites a low-repro progression blocker that would require pushing the console release date back if fixed. To that end, to ensure the game releases on all platforms simultaneously, it has been pushed to December. </p>



<p>Delays for games are a rare occurrence, much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less at the last minute</a>. Given the popularity of Unbeatable, it’s sure to be disappointing. However, D-CELL GAMES does mention that, with the extra time, it’ll be able to work on some pre-launch content it couldn’t get to. So, while it’ll be a month before we get to play it, the version we’ll get will hopefully be the best possible one.</p>



<p>What do you think of Unbeatable’s last-minute delay? Are you disappointed? Did you play the demo? If so, did you enjoy it?

It can be a lot of fun to track things down on your own, but it can also prove challenging at times. If you're struggling to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest, we'll help you along with things.</p><p>Note that you need to extract from the topside with Major Aiva's Patch once you obtain it. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bring along an augment with a safe pocket so that you can ensure you don't lose your quest item even if you fall in battle.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, read on for where to find Major Aiva's Patch in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest</h2><p>Your first objective for Echoes of Victory Ridge will be to actually find Victory Ridge, which is located in the northern portion of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Zoom in and seek the West Broken Bridge POI--that's where you're headed. Note that this is a mostly safe area in the majority of matches, but you never know if you might run into other questers, so keep an eye out and try to be friendly. Or shoot them on site--it's your call.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275" data-ratio="0.55354993983153" data-width="1662" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275"></a><figcaption>West Broken Bridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the circled area above, you'll need to look for a small box containing Major Aiva's Patch. This can be hard to spot if you don't know where to search. Look around for part of the fallen road that can be crawled under--more easily spotted if standing on the northern end of the POI and looking south. Under the right side of this crumbled road is the box with Major Aiva's Patch inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277"></a><figcaption>Major Aiva's Patch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg"></figure><p>Place Major Aiva's Patch in your safe pocket if you came equipped with one, then head east to the North Complex Elevator to extract. There are often a lot of ARC patrolling here, so retreat to safety after calling the elevator if you get their attention and can't fight your way out of it.

                <p>As part of Nintendo's latest earnings briefing, the company <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it is open to spending some of its cash reserves on a variety of business functions, including buying game developers.</p><p>Nintendo said it wants to spend money to invest in strengthening its game development pipeline, and this includes acquiring companies to make them subsidiaries. Nintendo historically does not buy many companies, but it's something the company would consider under the right conditions.</p><p>Nintendo did not name any specific acquisition targets. Some of the companies that Nintendo has acquired in the past 10 years have included Shiver, Dynamo Pictures, SRD, and Next Level Games.</p><p>Beyond buying companies outright, Nintendo said it will use some of its money to fund internal development and expansion, including through the construction of a second building at its corporate headquarters in Japan. In 2022, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2022/220412.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo spent $32 million to buy land in Kyoto</a> to build a new office that is scheduled to open by December 2027.</p><p>Additionally, Nintendo said it will spend more money on "opportunities that have an affinity with our game business," and that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">making more movies.</a> Nintendo will release The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in 2026, followed by its live-action Zelda movie in 2027. Additional movies will follow.</p><p>In other news, Nintendo just announced that the Switch 2 has sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">more than 10 million units</a> and has become the fastest-selling Nintendo platform of all time over its first four months.

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>

It’s still something to brag about, and yet notable accessory company 8BitDo doesn’t seem keen to boast that it recently debuted new firmware for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2">Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a> that enables this handy trick.</p><p>Version 2.0 of its firmware for both controllers (available now in its <a href="https://app.8bitdo.com/Ultimate-Software-V2/">Ultimate Software V2</a> on Windows and Mac) brings shake-to-wake support on Switch 2. Once either controller is paired with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLT-fUVxsBU">goofy one-time procedure</a>, you can simply turn on your gamepad, give it a little shake, then your console will wake up. I’ve confirmed that it works on my Switch 2 with both controllers.</p><p>The lack of Switch 2 wake-up in 8BitDo’s latest controllers was one of the reasons why I’ve been suggesting other models to <em>Verge </em>readers. At around $69.99 each, these aren’t cheap. And yet, models that are considerably less expensive (like GuliKit’s $29.99 ES Pro and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">other solid controllers</a>) shipped months ago with the ability to wirelessly wake the Switch 2.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814551/8bitdos-latest-wireless-controllers-can-now-shake-to-wake-the-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

<p>What appears to be a nearly full lineup of Intel Core Ultra 300 Panther Lake CPUs has been leaked online ahead of an official announcement. </p>



<p>The new CPUs, which were listed by known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/jaykihn0/status/1986086104286597269">jaykhin0</a>, show processors ranging from the high-end Core Ultra X9 388H to the Core Ultra 3 322. When it comes to Cores, Panther Lake features a max of 16 cores, depending on the chip. For clock speed, users are looking at a max boost of 5.1 GHz for the top processor while the more entry-level options reach 4.4 GHz. </p>



<p>It’s unknown if this is the complete family of CPUs for the next mainline release, but it’s enough to get an idea of what enthusiasts should expect. You can check out all of the early specs for yourself below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A24 and Netflix are teaming up for a new video game adaptation: Overcooked. Furthermore, it will take the form of an unscripted reality cooking competition.</p>



<p>If you are an avid multiplayer fan, no title has come close to being as fun and frustrating as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overcooked</a>. Created by Ghost Town Games, the cooking simulator made waves in 2016 for its stressful yet enjoyable gameplay. Since then, a sequel and remaster have come out and it remains one of the best co-op indie titles in recent years. Now, it seems the concept of the game is making its way to one of the world’s biggest streaming platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-and-a24-planning-unscripted-competition-show-based-on-overcooked">Netflix and A24 Planning Unscripted Competition Show Based on Overcooked </h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive report from Deadline</a>, the outlet revealed that A24 has acquired the rights to Overcooked and wants to adapt the game into a cooking competition. With that, Netflix is said to be teaming up with the company to stream the series. No official comments from Netflix or A24 are available at this time. </p>



<p>As for what the show will look like, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a> says it’ll be similar to Nailed It! and The Floor is Lava, two family-friendly shows Netflix has. Still, the high-octane challenges and ensuing chaos will remain, which were key to the game’s rapid success. Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine, and Phil Duncan from Ghost Town Games and A24 are set to executive produce the show.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how Overcooked is translated into reality TV. Fortunately, we won’t be the ones cooking and stressing out this time. Still, seeing how fun it is to watch people play it will definitely make for some fun television. As a fan of cooking shows myself, Overcooked is a great IP to bring to life in that way and I look forward to seeing how it comes out.</p>



<p>What do you think of Overcooked being a cooking competition? Did you play the game? Any good (or bad) memories with it? Could you do it in real life?

It will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,231 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,720 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. <span id="more-1004892"></span></p><p>In a message, the companies said the delay is the result of “[quality assurance] [hitting] a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable,” which fixing would require pushing the console release back due to certification timelines, and they would rather not release for all platforms at once, versus PC first and consoles later.</p><p>Here is the full message from Playstack and D-CELL:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! <em>UNBEATABLE</em> was supposed to come out tomorrow!</p><p>That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: <em>UNBEATABLE</em> will now release on December 9.</p><p>I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Why Would You Only Tell Me Now?</strong></p><p>Because the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</p><p><strong>But Why? The Game’s Done, Right?</strong></p><p>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; [quality assurance] hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of [certification] timelines, and not fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it.</p><p><strong>But Why Not Just Delay the Release of the Console Port?</strong></p><p>That’s very messy! We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody.</p><p><strong>But Why Release on December 9? That’s a Whole Month Away!</strong></p><p>Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.</p><p><strong>…But is the Game Good?</strong></p><p>It’s very good, and I’m very biased. We’ll see what reviewers think. But for those of you waiting the longest for this thing to come out, it makes me feel a bit crazy knowing how much you still don’t know about what’s this thing is. I’m very excited about it. I wish it could have been tomorrow, but.</p><p>Thank you to everyone who’s rooted for us up until this point. It’s not much longer now.</p><p>—RJ Lake and everyone at D-CELL and Playstack</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/unbeatable-delayed-to-december-9]]></content:encoded>

                <p>You'll take on a lot of quests that send you to the Dam Battlegrounds in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, including one from Tian Wen who wants you to search for Major Aiva's Mementos in some apartment buildings. This is a straightforward quest on paper, but because there are multiple buildings to explore and the ever-looming threat of ARC and other raiders, it's best to know right where to find these mementos so you can get out quickly.</p><p>Since you need to extract with Major Aiva's Mementos, it's a good idea to equip an augment that lets you store an item in a safe pocket. Once you pick up the mementos, you can toss it in that safe pocket and take it home with you even if you end up dead before you can extract.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's find Major Aiva's Mementos and wrap up The Major's Footlocker quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva’s Mementos for The Major's Footlocker quest</h2><p>Major Aiva's Mementos can be found in an apartment building located at the Ruby Residence POI. This area is located in the northwestern section of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138" data-ratio="0.58616404308202" data-width="2414" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138"></a><figcaption>Ruby Residence</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the apartment complex, you'll want to head into the leftmost building. The item you're looking for is on the top floor (not the roof). Head up two flights of stairs, then wrap around and follow the rooms until you reach a dead end with a window and a box on a desk in the corner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg"></figure><p>This box contains Major Aiva's Mementos. You'll need to interact with it, then pick up the item and store it in your inventory.</p><p>As stated above, you're required to extract with this item. Hopefully, you have a safe pocket slot! Either way, your closest options are likely to be the Central Swamp Lift to the south or the North Complex Elevator to the east. The safer choice is probably the latter, as the former tends to stay pretty busy with other players perusing the swamp for mushrooms and other quests. Whichever you choose, play things safe and get out alive, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly trickling in, including a limited-time offer on NordVPN. The VPN company is offering its several of its <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscription plans for up to 77% off</a>, with an additional 3 months tacked on for even better value</strong>. Using a VPN is a good way to buff up your privacy capabilities and maintain access to region-locked content while traveling. If you've been on the fence, NordVPN's discounted prices make now a great time to consider a subscription.</p><p>NordVPN is offering all 24-month and 12-month versions of its Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime subscription tiers at significant discounts, with an additional three months included. That's 15 total months of VPN service for far less than you'd normally pay.</p><p>The 24-month Prime plan offers the best value. It includes full access to the VPN, plus additional incentives such as 1TB of cloud storage, advanced identity protection, and the NordProtect service, which has a robust suite of insurance, Dark Web monitoring, and credit freeze assistance options. The 24-month Prime plan normally costs $836.73, but with the discount, new subscribers can sign up for just $186. That's a whopping $650 savings, and it includes the bonus three months, for a total of 27 months.</p><p>If you're looking for something in the short term, the 12-month plans are also discounted, and each one includes the three extra months. For example, the 12-month Prime subscription includes everything in the 24-month plan, but instead costs $127.35 (normally $464.85/year), and you're getting 15 months at that price thanks to the bonus three months.</p><p>We've included a quick breakdown of NordVPN's discounted plans below, and you can browse the full details of the deal at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NordVPN's website</a>. NordVPN lists the monthly cost of its plans, but the 2-Year plans are actually billed every 24 months, and the 1-Year plans are billed annually, so you'll pay the full price for the subscription period upfront when you sign up. NordVPN also offers monthly plans, but these are not eligible for the Black Friday deal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> is an anime-inspired "arcade-flawless" rhythm game that was set to launch tomorrow, on November 6, on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam. However, developer D-Cell Games has delayed Unbeatable to next month, just hours before the game's launch, citing a progression-blocking bug that it says must be fixed before release.&nbsp;</p><p>"Unbeatable was supposed to come out tomorrow," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/598542531394797771?l=english">announcement</a> on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> reads. "That's a scary sentence. Here's a worse one: Unbeatable will now release on December 9. I hate that I have to say this. There's no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I'm <em>personally </em>sorry about this and wish it was different."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/ASRfsN8-okg" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASRfsN8-okg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The delay announcement features a QA and in the "Why would you only tell me now?" section, D-Cell responds, "Because the decision was only made a few hours ago (No, really, I'm writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made). We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the very last-minute delay, D-Cell says, "QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that's serious enough it's considered unreleasable," and that "fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and <em>not </em>fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We're fixing it."&nbsp;</p><p>As for why the game is being delayed more than a month to December 9, it is due to other games launching over the next month. D-Cell says the team had a pretty good spot on November 6, "where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a <em>lot </em>to find another island, and [December 9] is the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us some breathing room we didn't have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow."&nbsp;</p><p>Unbeatable will now launch on December 9 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-releases-in-november">check out the Unbeatable reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/05/anime-inspired-rhythm-game-unbeatable-delayed-to-december-hours-before-its-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-brings-back-the-halcyon-era-of-online-water-cooler-talk.1344880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s easy to grow jaded as a gamer, and even easier to forget why you got interested in games to begin with. As trends in video games change, you may find yourself longing for an imagined yesteryear, where that spark was still fresh. As a member of the diehard cult that hopes that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/telltale-delays-the-wolf-among-us-2-till-at-least-next-year-because-if-its-half-baked-were-going-to-get-torn-to-shreds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Wolf Among Us 2</em> will ever see the light of day</a>, <em>Dispatch </em>feels like a return to the experimental golden age of episodic choice-driven storytelling, where fun isn’t in photorealism but in the online water cooler buzz of what you chose and why.</p><p>After bingeing the first four playable episodes of <a href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, I found myself swept back (<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-narrative-superhero-game-episodic-telltale-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside other like-minded, nostalgic players</a>) into the magic of<em> Life is Strange</em> and <em>The Walking Dead—</em>the very games that ignited my love for storytelling in my teens when an innocuous <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange/b/playstation4/archive/2015/01/29/life-is-strange-episode-one-chrysalis-review-game-informer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameInformer magazine blurb</a> first sold me on the dream of games playing like episodic TV. It follows Robert Robertson (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-video-game-interview-2000672017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">played by Aaron Paul</a>), a semi-retired superhero turned mission coordinator, assigning heroes to crises based on their skills and (difficult) personalities, both with the promise of leveling up over time. Your squad of “heroes” is the Z-team in every sense. It’s a <a href="https://aftermath.site/james-gunn-suicide-squad-dc-comics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chaotic mix of washed-up villains no one expects to redeem</a>, each carrying enough emotional baggage to test the most seasoned therapist (caped or otherwise) a headache.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Episodes 5 &amp; 6 Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zidpOy-Zta4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <em>Dispatch</em>’s branching choices aren’t quite as splintered as the most procrastinated windshield spider cracks, it has already revived the lost art of player-driven internet chatter—debating everyone’s choices, overlooked details, and speculating on how the story might unfold in the remaining four episodes.&nbsp;</p><p>Being on the ground floor of something gaming-related that’s tied to players’ choices, discussing them, and trying to figure out how they’ll play out as the entire story unfolds in semi-weekly releases allows for community-driven conversations without the frustration of an episodic narrative that’s incomplete. This way, we see the whole work as evolving, rather than judging it based on unfinished pieces, which often leads to tired debates about graphics instead of emotional storytelling and character banter that really tug at your heartstrings or make you laugh.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She’s insecure without her powers without her necklace but Robert? Who’s almost a parallel to her? He likes both the hero she is and the human being that she is.

In <em>Dispatch</em>’s fandom, players feel less like rivals in a competitive arena and more like a community—eager to swap decisions, analyze tiny details, trade puzzle tips, and even talk about romance without feeling juvenile or ironic.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer"><h3>Nothing But Respect For This Manual Ear And Nose Hair Trimmer</h3></a><p>The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is a simple piece of metal that is leagues better than its flimsy, electric counterparts.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-cheap-indie-game-sale-roguelike-metroidvania-2000641389</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-most-underrated-roguelikes-of-the-past-6-years-is-just-3-on-switch-right-now.1344853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> came out <a href="https://kotaku.com/dicey-dungeons-is-a-good-entry-point-for-deck-builders-1837283279">way back in 2019</a>, a fact that blew my mind when I went to go double-check it today. That feels like a lifetime ago, but the deckbuilding roguelike itself still feels surprisingly fresh. Developed by Terry Cavanagh (<em>Super Hexagon</em>, <em>VVVVVV</em>), it combines two of my favorite things, turn-based combat and getting burned on RNG re-rolls, into a great dice battling game that too often goes overlooked. Somehow it’s currently just $3 on Switch.</p> <p>The premise is basically “what if you took a traditional turn-based dungeon game and ran every action through a jumble of chaos?” You collect equipment in the form of cards which dictate what actions you can take, and dice which are used to activate the cards. Some cards can only work with certain dice, and certain abilities will be stronger or weaker depending on the rolls you link them with. It’s a multi-layered math problem that sounds like homework in theory but is actually quite straightforward to navigate and slickly implemented in practice.</p>

 <p>There’s a bit of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, a bit of <em>Balatro</em>, and a whole lot of Cavanagh’s own clever design work going on. It’s not the only great Switch indie game on sale right now, though. A whole bunch of them are super cheap for the next week or so:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sifu</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>The Pathless</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Haiku, the Robot</em> – $4 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Ashen</em> – $10 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dredge</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Gorogoa</em> – $4.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> – $6 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Blasphemous</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> <li><em>Dicey Dungeons</em> – $3 (80 percent off)</li> <li><em>Darkest Dungeon</em> – $7.50 (70 percent off)</li> <li><em>Kentucky Route Zero: TV Edition</em> – $10 (60 percent off)</li> <li><em>Risk of Rain 2</em> – $6.25 (75 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>I’ve already sung <em>Dicey Dungeons</em>‘ praises, but I want to give another special shoutout to <a href="https://kotaku.com/haiku-the-robot-hollow-knight-silksong-review-metroidva-1848910676"><em>Haiku, the Robot</em></a>. This is another one that was easy to miss when it came out a few years back. It’s a retro-styled Metroidvania that has some neat ideas but doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. There’s fun combat, some light platforming, and a great soundtrack. Plus a grappling hook. But it’s not an overwhelming maze or a gauntlet of brutal boss fights. It’s inspired by <em>Hollow Knight</em> but a much friendlier version of that formula, while still feeling authentic and charming. At just $4, it’s also a steal.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wow-there-are-way-too-many-nintendo-apps.1344850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-play-time-session-switch-3ds-wii-u-2000641372">Nintendo launched a new Store app</a> for mobile phones that lets you wishlist, search for, and buy Switch and Switch 2 games on your phone. And that’s neat, but uh, why is this a separate app? Why does Nintendo keep insisting that you need one app to listen to music, another one to handle parental controls, and yet a few more to buy games, get news, and manage your Switch 2 console? It’s getting ridiculous.</p> <p>On November 5, the Nintendo Store App was released on mobile phones, letting users check out the Switch and Switch 2 eShop and even dig into some really interesting playtime data that the Mario maker has been collecting for years. Yet, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/nintendo-co-ltd/id1062496488">it also means Nintendo now has five separate non-gaming apps</a>.</p>

 <ul> <li>Nintendo Switch App</li> <li>Nintendo Music App</li> <li>Nintendo Today!</li> <li>Nintendo Switch Parental Controls</li> <li>Nintendo Store App</li> </ul> <p>Want to see which of your friends are online or manage your screenshots? <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-app-update-screenshots-upload-qr-code-1851782946">Use the Switch mobile app</a>. Want to buy a Switch 2 game on your phone? Well, download the newly released store app and use that. Also, the store app just opens a browser when you try to buy a game, so it’s not even that useful. Want to manage your console’s parental controls? Guess what, buddy? Go download another app. Curious about any new Nintendo news or announcements today? Fuck you, go download yet another app. Perhaps you wish to enjoy some music from your favorite Switch game, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-music-app-update-nes-games-donkey-kong-1851786691">Oh, you already know what I’m going to tell you: Download another app</a>.</p>

 <p>It’s all so strange and unnecessary. All of these apps feel barebones and not very useful because individually, each one only offers a few options and features. I’d much rather have a single Nintendo Switch app on my phone that contains a store, a little news section, and a way to manage my console and friends list. Breaking that out across three apps is silly. I’d even shove the parental controls into the main Switch app, too. This is mostly how Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation handle it, though Sony and Microsoft <em>also</em> break out parental controls into separate apps like Nintendo.</p> <p>Anyway, I’m excited for Nintendo to announce another new app next year that lets me change the visual settings on my Switch 2 and then another app that lets me manage my saves. I want 18 different Nintendo apps that I bounce between by 2030!</p>

While that’s not quite close to its 170,000-player peak, it’s still a hefty number of players.</p>
