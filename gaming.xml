<p>This request from Nintendo to not share content also extends to not revealing details from the participant website or talking about the experience with "others". One exception to this rule is if you participate "as a group" in the playtest, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it's "within the bounds of your group".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kohvyj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you might recall, the previous playtest immediately led to all sorts of leaks - with participants uploading details and videos about the experience, and also live streaming it. Nintendo reportedly responded to this at the time with copyright takedowns across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Although Nintendo was enforcing these rules in the previous test, oddly, it didn't even bother to disable in-game screenshots or the video recording feature on the Switch. This latest playtest is also bumping the participant count from 10,000 users to "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide" so the chance of a leak has just been increased.</p>

According to the credits (via IGN), Kouji Takeda is Donkey Kong, and the new voice for Pauline is Jenny Kidd.</p>
<p>Takeda is the voice of DK in the Japanese dub of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, and it follows reports of Takashi Nagasako (the voice of DK for over two decades) not being credited in last month's Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>As for Kidd, this actress and musician takes on the younger 13-year-old version of Pauline. The same character was voiced by Kate Higgins in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ztxqlk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb69de702bf0b/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is now officially available for the Switch 2, and while there's not often much to look at when it comes to game cases nowadays, some titles do include some extra artwork. We saw it with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> physical release, and DK's new release also has artwork on this side of the case.</p>
<p>It's an image of Donkey Kong and Pauline taking a break from their new adventure. You might have seen this artwork in some other promotional materials before now. Although there's no Switch 2 branding, you can still swap it to the front side of the case. Here's a look, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT">YouTuber Jake Randall</a> on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ztxqlk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>So, if you haven't already got a physical version of Donkey Kong Bananza, or just don't plan on getting a hard copy of the game, this is what it looks like when you open the case! Nintendo also did <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/heres_a_first_look_inside_metroid_dreads_nintendo_switch_game_case">similar full spread shots like this</a> on some box arts during the Switch generation.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the DK physical release, the game card (which includes the <em>entire</em> game on the card) features the same artwork as Banaza's front cover featuring DK and Pauline. And the <a href="https://x.com/BoTalksGames/status/1943776059562070078">back of the case</a> shows off some more artwork of DK, while also highlighting some other aspects of the game.</p>
<p>All of this has got us wondering if our community has picked up this new Switch 2 release physically or if they purchased the game digitally via the eShop? <em>So, vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>To apply and participate, you'll need to have a Nintendo Account and an "active" Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership. This is a test of the "same service" Nintendo performed a test for in October of last year.</p>
<p>One other notable update is the fact is participants will be able to download this "exclusive software" on not only their original Switch system but also the Switch 2, which was released last month.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kohvyj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This test will be available to users located in the US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Japan, the UK, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. And it will take place between <strong>28th July 2025</strong> until <strong>10th August 2025</strong>.</p>

<p>Registrations open this week on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's official website</a>, and if you participated in the previous playtest, you can apply to participate individually or as a group for this latest test. Applicants wil lbe accepted on a "first-come, first-served basis".</p>
<p>In the leadup to the original playtest last year, Nintendo told participants to not discuss or disclose anything about it. Of course, this led to details and footage of the game leaking online, with some users even streaming their experience.</p>
<p>The same rules apply with this latest test and Nintendo also notes how this playtest is expected to accept "as many as 40,000 participants worldwide". This announcement follows the news earlier this week Nintendo would be hosting an online demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, due out next month.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced it is hosting another Switch Online Playtest Program later this month. The closed beta is slated to begin on July 28, and it will give eligible users another chance to sample the same mystery service that was tested out during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-launching-mysterious-switch-online-test-soon-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6527070/" data-ref-id="1100-6527070">October 2024 Playtest Program</a>.</p><p>As before, the Switch Online Playtest Program is only open to select players on a first come, first served basis. To qualify, you must be at least 18 years old and have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription as of July 17.</p><p>This time around, Nintendo is allowing players to apply either individually or as part of a group. You can create an application starting on July 18 at 3 PM PT/6 PM ET, with registration formally opening on July 21 at 8 AM PT/11 AM ET. Full details can be found on <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's website</a>.</p><p>This Playtest Program is scheduled to run from July 28 to August 10. Nintendo says it is "expected to accept as many as 40,000 participants worldwide."</p><p>As was the case during the first Playtest Program, Nintendo is asking participants not to publicly discuss the service they are testing. The company writes:</p><p>"We request that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others. If you participate as a group, you may communicate and exchange information as long as it remains within the bounds of your group."</p><p>This isn't the only beta test coming up for Switch Online members. Nintendo is also hosting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">limited-time Drag x Drive demo</a> from August 9-10. Unlike the Playtest Program, this is open to all NSO subscribers and will take place during three specific time slots over those two days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157386/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> is the newest entry in Spike Chunsoft's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">AI: Somnium Files</a> series and is actually a spin-off of the first two games. As a 'mid-quel' between both stories, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a good companion piece for fans of the series but not so much for those unfamiliar. Its visual novel elements are bolstered by new gameplay mechanics that keep the game, and series, from becoming stale.</p>
<p>This entry also sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date. This time around, his idol friend, Iris Sagan, is kidnapped by a UFO and she’s forced to play escape room games in order to stay alive, while Kaname works around the clock to uncover the dark secrets behind Iris’s abduction.</p>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname Date is the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_heroes_trails_through_daybreak_ii">Trails through Daybreak 2</a> of the series, as its story doesn’t move the overall series plot forward in a meaningful way, but focuses on a much more personal conflict. I’ve always loved the series’ incorporation of wacky conspiracy theories to its mysteries, but then it turns out that the truth is actually much more grounded.</p>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157382/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While I enjoyed the characters talking about how ancient civilisations received alien technology, I do think that No Sleep for Kaname Date has the weakest twists of the three games so far. They’re a little more predictable this time around and as a result don’t hit as hard.</p>
<p>By its very nature of being a spin-off, the story could leave some fans feeling alienated, but it reintroduces characters like the second game’s protagonist, Ryuki, to show players what he was doing before his prior big debut. The new characters Hina and Akemi are fantastic additions, as the former’s love for puzzles and the latter’s weird reptilian origins make the already weird cast even more enigmatic.</p>
<p>This makes No Sleep for Kaname Date an excellent bridge between both games. The game fully expects you to know who these characters are and how they fit into the overall Somnium Files universe, so it's best to go in once you’ve played the other two entries.</p>

<p>The previous games were written by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who was also director of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a> series. However, this time around, No Sleep for Kaname Date is directed and written by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/it-was-hell-spike-chunsoft-devs-discuss-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">Kazuya Yamada</a>. Honestly, it’s hard to tell that this game was written by someone else entirely. Yamada did a great job emulating Uchikoshi’s writing style. Iris is just as bubbly as ever, and Date is as much of a perv as he was in the previous games. The characters’ personalities are consistent, which prevents No Sleep for Kaname Date from feeling jarring.</p>
<p>The main gameplay mechanic revolves around Psyncs, where Date can jump into the psyche of another person. Date will have to solve “mental locks” that are related to the current mystery. Here, his eyeball companion, Aiba, navigates throughout the dream-like world interacting with various objects. For example, if she comes across an important script, she might get the option to “take” or “read” it. Only one of them is the correct answer that’ll progress through the mental locks.</p>
<p>These puzzles have remained largely unchanged from previous games and end up devolving into guessing games. There’s really not much of a strategy except hope that you pick the right answer. It feels rather unengaging sometimes.</p>
<figure><a title="No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157385/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, the new escape room puzzles are much more exciting and make up for the somewhat underwhelming Somniums. Ironically, the game where Uchikoshi is the least involved with borrows the mechanic he’s best known for. These escape rooms require you to really put your brain to the test. For example, in the first escape room, you have to look at patterns on torn flags to figure out a special code to put into a terminal, or else your room will run out of air.</p>
<p>The escape rooms feel intense when you’re on a timer, especially compared to the Somniums. It’s difficult to strike a balance when it comes to escape rooms, but they feel appropriately challenging here. I felt an immense sense of satisfaction when I solved them, and that they were never unfairly hard.</p>
<p>If you are having trouble during these segments, however, there are plenty of gameplay settings and options to tailor your gameplay experience to be more approachable. You can enable infinite hints and even ask the game to reveal the solution to a particular puzzle, too.</p>

<p>Having played both the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/new-ai-the-somnium-files-is-latest-switch-2-game-to-include-mouse-mode-support">Switch and Switch 2</a> versions of the game, the latter’s graphical enhancements and load time improvements feel negligible. However, No Sleep for Kaname Date is a visual novel, so the lack of differences don’t really matter much. The Switch 2 version does support Mouse Mode, which I tried out for a bit before reverting back to standard Joy-Con controls. You can navigate escape rooms and Somniums, as well as interact with clues and items. Sure, it’s a nice feature to have but the novelty eventually wears off.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No Sleep for Kaname is a good spin-off for existing AI: The Somnium Files fans. While the Somnium segments haven’t evolved much since their introduction in the first game, the new escape puzzle games are a welcome addition to the series. Despite a new writer taking the helm for this entry, the writing is tonally consistent and the characters are as charming as ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I have already made clear on this website</a>, there are few things I love more in video games than moving guys around a map. Today, I would like to pay tribute to my favourite entry in the MGAM genre: <em>Order of Battle</em>, a turn-based WW2 tactics game first released in 2015.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> is basically a more modern version of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_General" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the classic <em>Panzer General</em></a>. With hex maps, turn-based gameplay and a probability-based resolution to battles, it basically plays the same as a round of <em>Advance Wars</em> or <em>Fire Emblem</em>, only you have Sherman tanks and paratroopers instead of wizards and hero characters.</p><p>I will say here that, before we go any further, this game has <em>problems</em>. For one, not long after launch it adopted what was at the time a fairly controversial release model where the base game (including a simple tutorial) was free, and players were then asked to buy each campaign individually. That's pretty normal by 2025 standards, but back then it pissed a lot of people off!</p><p>It also suffers from the same problem a lot of Second World War games do in that in trying to give you access to multiple factions--you can play scripted campaigns as both the Germans and Japanese--they end up inadvertently putting the player in charge of stuff like...genocides and the advances that led to the Rape of Nanking.<a href="https://kotaku.com/hey-history-games-the-nazis-were-the-bad-guys-1842463381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Things here are nowhere near as glib as they are in, say, <em>Panzer Corps 2</em>, which almost revels in it</a>, but it's still uncomfortable to be so focused on moving little guys around a map when what came after those guys, even if the game never mentions it, was <em>a holocaust</em>.</p><p>(Given the purchasing model mentioned above though, you absolutely never have to play those campaigns, and there are loads available, including the most interesting ones, for the Americans and British.)</p><p>Even as a game, it has issues! A big part of <em>Order of Battle</em>, and one of the things that separates it from <em>Panzer General</em>, is that it includes both a visible frontline (which ebbs and flows depending where each of your units is on the map), and the ability to sever your opponent's supply lines by cutting across theirs, which can slow units down and even starve them of ammo, making them easier to mop up. It sounds great in theory--<a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-of-command-ii-is-a-really-solid-world-war-two-str-1839842115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and is something the rival <em>Unity of Command</em> series is actually able to do well</a>--but its implementation in <em>OoB </em>is maddening, because it allows a single unit to cut off an entire army's supply lines, across thousands of miles of frontline, which is just some bullshit both from an authenticity standpoint as well as gameplay one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Order of Battle - Burma Road Trailer 2017" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JOVHV7_IYPU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>All of which is to say that I love this game so much I do not really care about any of those things, at least not enough to stop me enjoying the game, because something <em>Order of Battle</em> does <em>very </em>well is let you move guys around a map. It excels at it. Everything about it is perfect. The way you can snap between selected units, the speed at which you can make them move, the little vrooms or marching boot sounds as they zoom off down a road, the way you can get a guy moving then click on the next guy and start <em>him </em>moving while the last guy is <em>still </em>moving, creating an endless succession of guys moving across the map all at once, it's wonderful.</p><p><em>Order of Battle</em> gives you the tangible thrill of being in command without any of the responsibility. Look at all these guys go! It doesn't matter if they stumble into an ambush, that's life, the point is that it was fun getting them there in the first place. You don't have to write letters to grieving mothers back home, and even if you did, their sons died doing what they did best: moving six hexes straight into enemy crossfire because their commander was too bust enjoying the cute noises they made while doing it.</p><p>What's also cool in <em>Order of Battle</em> is the sheer scale and variety of maps you get to move across. Ignoring the German and Japanese campaigns, there are still so many different ways you can fight this war as the British, Americans and Soviet Union, from the deserts of Africa to the snowy wastelands of Finland to the jungles of Burma. Each of those locations has different types of map, with different climates and different sizes. There are defensive maps, which are the worst, because they involve the least amount of moving guys around. There are dense urban struggles, vast open steppes that your tanks can soar across and, best of all, some big naval invasion maps which let you move ships, then have some of those ships turn into guys, then you get to move <em>those guys</em> around on land.</p><p>I don't want to discredit the rest of the game here (<a href="https://kotaku.com/order-of-battle-world-war-ii-the-kotaku-review-1795749182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even if this isn't a review, I've done that already</a>), as <em>Order of Battle</em> also has a neat experience system where your units can grow and improve (and be upgraded with better gear) throughout a campaign, and many missions feature some wild attempts at scripting, some of which works magnificently, others which...well, they tried. Campaigns are a pleasure to play through on a tactical basis, not just a vroom vroom basis, and for all the times this game stumbles I admire the way it's able to pick itself up again and keep going given it was developed with what appear to be quite limited resources.</p><p>But yeah, for everything it does well, there's nothing it does better than letting me move guys around a map. So thank you, <em>Order of Battle</em>, for being the best in the MGAM business.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lets-plays-sleep-youtube"><h3>Is Falling Asleep To Let’s Plays Medically Approved Gamer Melatonin Or Nah</h3></a><p>A gamer neurologist discusses whether YouTubers are onto something with this Millennial-meets-Gen-Z craze</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/godot-version-control-statistics-cms"><h3>A Salute To The 13%</h3></a><p>Let them live a little</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/order-of-battle-ww2-turn-based-tactics-game-pc]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>Sucker Punch Productions discusses its eagerly anticipated sequel, and how it's building something new on strong foundations</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The weight of expectation that Sucker Punch Production is carrying is rather heavy. As one of the few first-party PlayStation games of 2025, many players will be looking to it to scratch the story-driven AAA blockbuster itch that has been out of reach for a lot of the year. But, beyond that, it has the unenviable task of following up the beloved Ghost of Tsushima.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Yotei has been kept behind the curtain throughout most of its development, but recently, it had a big showing as the focal point of a State of Play broadcast. Depending on who you ask, they'll either say it looks stunning and has some potentially exciting gameplay evolutions or it looks good... but also very familiar.</p><p dir="ltr">That split in perspective isn't surprising to directors Jason Connell and Nate Fox. In fact, that very much is the intent. The challenge, however, is in finding a good balance between the two, which is easier said than done. Following the State of Play, GameSpot spoke to Connell and Fox about the success of Ghost of Tsushima and how Sucker Punch approached its sequel, as well as what players can expect when the game launches in October.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534077" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534077"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534077-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Ghost of Tsushima was a spectacular game and I think it's fair to say that it elevated awareness around the studio significantly. What was that like afterward? How did you feel after that and did you start to feel the pressure of having to meet that high bar now?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Connell</strong>: Making Tsushima, there's certainly a lot of passion that goes into that project. Nate and I love samurai cinema, so getting to make a game in that sort of way was exciting, but I think it's certainly very thrilling to see it land with a bunch of people--way more people than maybe we anticipated. And that's a very positive feeling; kind of an overwhelming feeling too.</p><p dir="ltr">The amount of people that were posting photo mode [shots] on Twitter and reaching out and making comments--whenever you have something that many people play, there's going to be things they hate about it, there's going to be things that they love about it. And you just hear it all. It's certainly a new feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">But I know for me, and Nate might feel different, it certainly makes it feel daunting to go make whatever comes next, because inevitably people are going to be like, "Oh, is this as good as your last thing?" That's just a normal part of the creation process, though, so I think it's a gift. We have great [intellectual properties]. We're part of a great studio. Sony, in general, lets us be really creative. It feels like we're sitting in a really awesome spot where we can build off the shoulders of an awesome game that we created, but then add all these extra new features in and fresh elements that maybe we didn't have time for in the last game because we were just trying to get the basics moving. It feels both exhilarating, overwhelming; really a lot of gratitude, but also at the same time really creatively fulfilling to be able to make Yotei the way we want to make it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nate Fox: </strong>I found it really inspiring, actually, to see people play the game on YouTube or Twitch and talk about what they liked, they didn't like. It fuels all of us here in the studio when we're making the sequel to see where people get so much enjoyment out of the game. And it's a new experience. When we were making Sly Cooper and Infamous, people didn't do live playthroughs of Sly, so I didn't know what level hit. It's really exciting to have this level of transparency into how people are enjoying the video game, you hope and you dream they're going to like this part or react in this way to that part.</p><p dir="ltr">Now we get to see it and see where we're right and where we're wrong, and it affects how you choose to work on the next game. But overall, it's a really incredible change in how video game creation works because before, you made a thing that you threw over a fence and you hoped people liked it, unlike a movie, where you could go into a movie theater and sit amongst people watching it and see if they laughed or didn't laugh. It is new now. We get to see how people really enjoy it or how they react.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With that in mind, has the process of coming up with or creating a sequel changed at all? Because I imagine so soon after you go, "Oh, we've done Tsushima, let's go to the next one now," you presumably have to sit there and start poking holes in the game that you just made and love to figure out where you can go next. Is that made any easier by being able to flip on a YouTube channel and have people just break down everything that they don't like? Or what's that process like for you both?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>[Laugs] Sorry. I started laughing because you're like, "Oh, you have to go through the process of pointing out the things you don't like" but at Sucker Punch, we are relentlessly critical of our work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>Every week.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>That is our love language. We just do criticism in a constructive way. We definitely are hard on ourselves, but it's because we want [our games] to be really great and we have a lot of passion to manifest this thing. So, when we get done with Ghost of Tsushima, we kind of know, "Oh, here are the parts we think are lovely. Here are the parts that we don't like as much. How can we invest more in the parts that seem very alive?" But it's such a long process of making the game. Of course, you're looking at online articles, photo mode posts, or YouTube, and it changes some of the ways that you consider the game because you can see [those things].</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>For sure. I know that, for Nate and me, all those things are true. And then before we even really started on the next thing, we sort of [said], "Here are the core pillars." Because when we're making Ghosts of Tsushima, it's just coming out of us and we're changing stuff daily. Now it's like, "Oh, we have this whole thing we built, now we want to turn it into a franchise, so what are the things you have to carry forward?" So, we created a whole pillar sheet: lethal precision and combat; samurai cinema film-inspired, stunning art direction and beautiful depiction of the world; not just photorealism but a style that kind of matches; surrounding ourselves with advisers. Whatever those pillars were, and there's a whole host of them, we're like, "Okay, these can't change. We have to do all of these. Now where's our sandbox? Where are we going to play? What do we want to push on?" And that was a kind of fun experiment.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you strike a balance between making progress in design and ideas without compromising those pillars, knowing that a lot of people might come to it looking for something drastically different? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: This sounds stupid, but it actually really helps and it really works: we actually use this term, "Fresh but familiar." There's versions of this game which could have been hyper familiar and there's obviously versions of the game that could be hyper fresh and you lose the identity of Ghost. But again, part of that is, what are you going to carry over? And for example, the art style, we could have taken a route where we're like, "Let's go for photorealism on the next one." But the art style is part of the identity to Ghost, so why would we move away from that? In my opinion, and I think our team's opinion, it is a longer-lasting, impressionable feeling to have a style that resonates with people, that resonates with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, some people might be like, "Oh, it kind of looks like the last one." I'm like, "Yeah, we love the art style of the last one. I think it's integral." And so what we said is, "Okay, now how do we expand upon that?" We have way longer sight lines. There's better visual rendering quality all over the place. Performance is better. There are all kinds of things that we improve and we could talk about that forever.</p><p dir="ltr">But the point is, that is familiar, but adding a little bit of freshness on it. And some things [are] purely fresh, like our memory mechanic [where you can relive Atsu's younger days] that we have that's inside the home. So, that's purely a narrative tool that you can do at any point in time. That is totally just a completely fresh thing. There's nothing like that in any of our previous games. And to be able to just bop back and forth instantaneously; totally new. Or sure, there's a relationship with animals in our games, like foxes and birds in the last one, and the sense of nature, wind, whatever. And this one, you have a wolf. The wolf is a much deeper experience than anything we've ever done before. So, it's a nice mix. It's the familiarity part of it, because wolf, animals, etc., but [it's going] way deeper that makes it a bit more fresh.</p><p dir="ltr">For us, Yotei is obviously an opportunity to stand on the familiar because we have a lot of fans that love that, but really think hard about the core aspects of the game we wanted to bring the freshness to. Exploration is a big one. Combat. I'm sure Nate will want to talk about combat. Those two are probably the biggest areas where we spent some time on.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>I do want to talk about combat. I think it's a great example of that fresh but familiar strategy that Jason was talking about. In Tsushima, we had this feeling of lethal precision that was born of classic samurai movies, and we loved it. So, we wanted to not change [that], but of course, we want to bring something fresh. A great example of this is, in Tsushima, we had four stances you could use, and for Yotei, we increased that. Now, you have five stances, but they're not just stances in how you hold your weapon. We said, "Okay, we're going to change those to actually be different melee weapons," even though, as a system, it's the same thing. It's just a radical visualization difference.</p><p dir="ltr">Oh, but wait, it's not, because if you switch over to, say, a kusarigama, which is the right weapon against an enemy holding a shield, it also has benefits because of the nature of what the weapon is. In that case, if you get surrounded by a bunch of enemies, you can swing the weighted chain above your head and do an area effect attack to hit a lot of enemies at once. Or if you're holding the spear and you're fighting near a cliff, you can use it to knock an enemy backward off the cliff to kill them. So it's a much broader application of tools than we had in Tsushima, but the foundation is the same style of lethal precision that was in that game. We wanted to give players more freedom, more options, but not leave or walk away from the core feeling that was established in that previous game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534084"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534084-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You mentioned previously the identity of Ghost. For me, one of the key factors in the identity was the character Jin, and the mythology that you built around him--the samurai code being corrupted and becoming something new. Is that a major element of Yotei and its identity? Because it seems like Atsu is a little more formed in her identity and is slowly becoming more deadly over time. Is there that same sense of mythology building around Atsu and the Onryo?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fox: </strong>So Ghost of Tsushima, as you point out, was absolutely about a samurai who sacrifices his codes to become a stealth fighter, and that was his arc. Ghost of Yotei is a spiritual sequel. It's not the same story at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu starts the game, she's a sellsword. She doesn't live by some code of the samurai. She'll do whatever it takes to win. And she is so relentless in her hunt for the Yotei Six, and she overcomes a lot of odds that should kill [most] people, so the folks around Ezo start to believe that she is a folk tale kind of monster, an Onryo, a vengeance ghost. Early in the game, people believe that about her. She has that identity because of her relentlessness.</p><p dir="ltr">And even though she has that quality that people think of her as larger than life, her transformation in the game isn't necessarily, how does she become more and more the Onryo? It's a question of how her identity as Onryo changes her. We get to see her transform from a broken lone wolf warrior who doesn't really care if she lives or dies to [someone that grows] to surround herself with a wolf pack that helps take care of her, and she changes in that journey. It's a unique story. It's a different take on a different facet of what it is to be a ghost in feudal Japan, and we're happy that people soon get to experience it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It sounds like one of those "what does Batman do to Bruce Wayne, as opposed to how does Bruce Wayne become Batman" stories. One of the things that really stuck out to me was the reliving memories stuff that you discussed. It feels like a kind of John Wick "You killed my dog" effect, where it's like you need something to humanize the main character in a game where the primary goal is to inflict brutal violence. What was the approach for that mechanic and the idea behind that, and what are the limitations of it? Is it that you can do it anywhere, or just specific areas?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>Yeah, there are specific areas in the game that Atsu will visit that are very rich with memories for her, and we wanted to let people experience those memories through an interactive way where you can hit a button, go back and actually play as young Atsu to really experience her life. But that freedom is really important to us because as gamers, as you know, when you're in control, you really feel like you're that character. You identify with them. Being able to go back and forth from memories to the present lets you do a before-and-after shot [showing] the warmth of her youth, juxtaposed with the cold loneliness of her adult life. And because you're in control, I think you feel it more.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as you say, we wanted to establish that feeling of what it used to be so that you could understand Atsu's loss, and I think everybody has had this experience where you maybe go home to your parents' house and you see the bedroom that you grew up in and whether you like it or not, you remember who you were at that time. These memories come back and it's a very human experience. And to make it interactive just helps drive home the universality of it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the other things that you really emphasize is the freedom and the idea that Ghost is never going to rush you to do anything before you want to do it. How do you approach that freedom when it could disrupt the pacing, if your character is suddenly running around doing something else for 25 hours when you've got this objective that is very timely? And, secondly, how do you account for FOMO? I'm one of those people who is constantly like, "What else am I missing?" It's that two-pathway gamer thing where we're like, "I'm going to go halfway down this one and halfway down this one and see what's up."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>We might be tapping into some anxiety for you.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Absolutely. Massively.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>[Laughs] We really want to reward different play styles. If there are people who just want to rabbit run the golden path--<em>we</em> don't think that's the best way to play the game, but it's a good story if you want to do that--go ahead, you can do that, and we don't want to obscure that from people. We don't want to make it hard for people who buy our game and that's what they want to do because they are invested in your story and they like it. We don't want to force them to go out to do a bunch of stuff they don't like to do in the open world and say, "You got to do these six things before you can go do their golden path." That doesn't seem like a great experience.</p><p dir="ltr">But at the same time, we also don't want to shove that in your face and put all the progression there and all the cool stuff that you can get on the golden path. We want to celebrate the people that like to play wide, and there's a lot of them. People like to play the game for 70, 80, 90 hours and use photo mode at every corner of the map, uncover the beauty, and find the little things, the medium things, the big things. That's why we create things like weapon sensei. To get weapons in the game, you have to hunt down the weapon sensei, you've got to find them in the world, build relationships with them, and then engage with them in sub-missions, and you'll get to get these new weapons and they'll train you how to use these cool new things.</p><p dir="ltr">That's one of the reasons why we put that stuff on the side path and out in the open world--such a huge part of the play experience. If you want to spend all your time in the open world, you should be able to do that. We're not going to force you to go over here and do this thing. It's really a simple philosophy that does manifest into some actual game mechanics in the way that we present the game. But really and truly, it's just trying to express to people that you can play it the way you want to play it. The best way to play it is, pull out the spyglass and explore around. We really do believe that, but at the same time, if you really are interested in that golden path story, we're going to make it easy for you to engage in it because there is a lot of emotion and a lot of heart and a lot of structure that does come from that. We don't want to obscure that from people. We're trying to celebrate both.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's one of those things that I know is tricky to design for. I'm one of those people who loves the freedom, but I also want the game to be gravitating around me to tell me where to go a little. I think I'm just an annoying person when it comes to open-world gaming.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>But I think [the] clue cards are that, a little bit. We got rid of this exhaustive journal that's just pages and pages and texts and texts and just what you've done, what you can do, what you're doing right now. It's exhaustive when people spend way more time on the map, visual, and pictorial references.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting these clues, you might get a little bit of a clue because you haven't gotten a weapon in a while or something like that. We might give you a little bit of a clue where a weapon might be and maybe we tell you where it is for this one and maybe we give you a general location. If weapons are your thing, cool, go do it. Or maybe we'll tell you about armor over here. If armor is your thing and that's what you want, great. We try to give you some of these opportunities so you're not completely aimless, and you'll never be aimless if you're on the golden path, but we try to feed you enough cool things to whet your appetite for what you possibly could do in the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One of the things that caught my eye was the segment where you were buying a map from a cartographer and it looked like you were placing the map piece. Can you tell me more about that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>We think maps are cool and we actually spent a lot of time figuring out ways we might be able to interact with the map a little bit more when somebody sells you a map or if you discover one. In this time period, cartographers were mapping out these areas, so it's a nice connection point there. But you can purchase these maps that can take you to a variety of things that you'll learn about and you'll want to get some of them, so there's a little mini-game where you have to figure out, based off the map that he gives you, where it goes, and when you figure out where it goes, it rewards you. It's a little bit of a mini-game inside of the map experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'm a person who plays primarily in stealth and when you were presenting Atsu she very much seems to be engaging head-on in combat. Will stealth players still be able to scratch their itch?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: You can absolutely sneak up on enemies and assassinate them when they're unaware. I think this is a really important part of the fantasy. Atsu is not burdened down with the sense of how you're supposed to honorably attack enemies. She'll do whatever it takes. We showed in the State of Play how you can use a kusarigama. There are more tools and different behaviors we've developed for Yotei to make that a richer experience, but I like to think that the stealth, even though you can just engage vis-a-vis stealth if you'd like with most enemies, it's about a dance between stealth using ranged attacks and melee combat. The player is not locked into any one of these things. You can move between them when you're up against a group of enemies, and it just offers a lot of freedom of play style to users.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm a ranged player, the rare weirdo who likes to shoot at things with a bow, and the game works for ranged attack folk. Again, I was talking about earlier, where offering the player a lot of options means that they get to play and approach the game in the way that best suits them. It's more than just combat or stealth. It's also whether or not you like to go after the main story or do a lot of exploration. That is a big component of how we want to make the game be what it is to you, so that it meets you where and how you want to play.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Working with two consoles now, PS5 and PS5 Pro, is there anything distinguishing between them? Are there any advantages to one over the other? What was it like to work with that extra horsepower?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell: </strong>The broader answer to your question is that we're going to actually do a bit more of a deeper dive on all the specifics of the Pro features and have all those details ready. Unfortunately, we don't have those here today.</p><p dir="ltr">I will say I can speak less specifically about that and more general about PlayStation and making the game. There are a whole host of things that, and some of it on the Pro too, that has really helped us visualize the world in a new way, and advance that artistic, beautiful style in an appropriate way that still celebrates that. It doesn't just go into photorealism, but it really props up our creative and artistic goals.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, way longer sightlines than we had in the last game. We've been able to vastly improve our far terrain rendering and I think people that see Tsushima and compare it will be like, "Whoa," because it's crazy. I was a bit shocked when those features came in. Or things like native 4K rendering or improved hair and skin. Snow deformation--we didn't have that in the last game. If you have a fight in the snow, your weapons make slices in the snow, your feet trample all over the place. The characters get all snowy, there's blood going everywhere. It's a messy, cool experience because of the deformation. We even extended the deformation into things like chunky mud, so if you're in really thick and deep mud. These are just things we didn't have before and that we do have in this game. We're really excited about that, but specifically for the Pro and the difference between the base and the Pro, we'll have a nice breakdown in the future regarding that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534078"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4534078-ghostofyotei_stateofplay_edgeofjapan_5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was it like getting Shinichiro Watanabe for the game? It must've been a wild journey to get him involved.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Connell</strong>: Each one of [the directors] have their own unique journey to try to bring forward the idea with them, and each one has their own way to approach it. Shinichiro Watanabe was also doing Lazarus at the time, and I think they were just launching it. It was in its first episode. It was a really exciting time, and I watched it and I was like, "Oh, man, I love this. This is good." It really just reminded me how much I loved Samurai Champloo, Cowboy Bebop.</p><p dir="ltr">See, these Samurai video games, it doesn't matter what they are. People do playthroughs of them and they throw lo-fi beats over the top of it, just for their stream or whatever. I'm like, "Man, we should do a mode where we celebrate that genesis point, really." Even though it's anime, it's not classical Samurai cinema, but there's a huge overlap with our fans like yourself or anyone, myself, that really is attracted to that and recognizes that. I was like, "We should celebrate that."</p><p dir="ltr">We reached out, had a meeting with them. They were super psyched on the idea, really excited.</p><p dir="ltr">Really, almost immediately [Watanabe-san] went into like, "Oh, I'm going to get these artists. I think these people might be really great fits." And within a very short amount of time, we were already getting music. We have several original tracks he's created. We've got some remixes of our actual score. It was a really positive and very exciting journey for us, and really, really, really honored that he was willing to and was excited about it. Our fans get to hear that when it comes out.</p>

Still, it is fun to walk into a room and shoot 20 random thugs with a big pistol. So that’s something. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-robocop-game-rogue-city-sequel-expansion-2025-pc-1851768472"><em>Unfinished Business</em></a></span><em> </em>opens in a really depressing way. Set after the events of the last game, it kicks off with an attack on the police station—which served as one of your central hubs in <em>Rogue City—</em>that leaves many of the NPCs from that game dead. A few of the main characters from the movies, like Officer Lewis, survive, point RoboCop in the direction of a big tower filled with mercenaries who were likely responsible, and then don’t show up again for hours and hours. It’s like<em> Unfinished Business</em> wants to remind players of the more varied world and characters of the last game before it dumps you into the boring corridors of OmniTower. </p><p>Once in OmniTower, <em>Unfinished Business</em> tasks you with reaching the upper levels of the massive structure. But between RoboCop and his goal are hundreds of bots and mercs ready to kill the shiny hero. While<em> Rogue City</em> featured plenty of first-person combat,<em> Unfinished Business</em> features loads more. This is  mostly an action game, whereas the last one could be charitably described as a low-budget spin on a Bethesda game.</p><p>Thankfully, gunning down creeps and saving hostages is still a blast in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. And a few new weapons, along with the ability to use the environment to take down baddies—like shoving someone down a garbage chute—help spice things up. But I really hope you liked the shooty-shooty bits from <em>Rogue City</em> because <em>Unfinished Business</em> is mostly that. </p><p>In <em>Rogue City</em>, I fell in love with a little slice of Old Detroit as I patrolled it, completed side missions, met various characters, and helped protect them. That’s all gone in <em>Unfinished Business</em>. There are still side quests and characters to meet, but most of them are left behind between levels as you keep moving up. Instead of a small slice of urban decay that you can grow to love, <em>Unfinished Business</em> gives you oh so many grey corridors and rooms. Thanks? </p><p>All the RPG systems from<em> Rogue City</em> are back in <em>Unfinished Business,</em> which does help add more to this game and keep it from being just a straight-up linear shooter, but compared to what came before, it’s disappointing. A few moments where you get to play as a pre-RoboCop Alex Murphy are neat, but don’t add much to the experience. </p><p>Hopefully, the devs behind <em>Unfinished Business</em> and <em>Rogue City </em>have a proper sequel in the works that brings back the open-world RPG formula that made that last game so charming and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-expansion-review-1851786534]]></content:encoded>

These games' unique deck-building mechanics, mixed with historical theaters of war, including Normandy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-stalingrad-board-game-review"><u>Stalingrad</u></a>, or North Africa, have helped grow its fanbase. And the release of last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-2200-callisto-board-game-review"><u>Undaunted 2200: Calisto</u></a> took the series from the fields of World War II and into space with a futuristic science fiction entry. Now, the team at Osprey has distilled the experience of the series into a solely deck-building experience with the release of Line of Fire: Burnt Moon. And they've done so with a surprising level of success.</p><div catalogid="57e7fdb8-1a14-4bf5-9012-6e9be9f29749" id="225455"><div id="225455" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Line of Fire: Burnt Moon: An Undaunted 2200 Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ditching the modular tiles or fold-out boards of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/undaunted-board-game-buying-guide">Undaunted games</a>, Line of Fire gives two players a set of five identical location boards, each with an assigned point values. Once all five get randomly placed out for both players, each side deploys forces to the various spots in an effort to hold eight points' worth of locations, or destroy all of the oppositions land-capturing units, claiming victory. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns begin with both players drawing four cards, and secretly selecting one of those to offer up in a bid to gain that round’s initiative. Whoever offers the card with a higher value gets to play first. Both of those cards are then discarded and the first player takes their turn placing out their hands of cards, followed by the second player, and once they are finished, new hands are drawn and the the process starts over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set on Jupiter’s moon, Io, in the world of Undaunted 2200, Line of Fire has a science fiction motif. So, instead of troops on the ground, you deploy ROVs – Remote Operated Vehicles – into the warzones. ROVs are composed of four different varieties, divided into A and B forces. Each ROV type has special actions it can take. For example, the MOSS units allow you to capture locations, while the DaCU units can build fortifications that can only be activated by playing an identical unit card on a previously deployed card. Players also have access to a small selection on personnel cards which provide benefits including adding cards to your deck or disabling an opponents ROVs, further adding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> elements to Line of Fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For players who are familiar with Osprey's Undaunted titles, many of Line of Fire’s mechanics will feel identical, from the initiative bidding to removing casualties. When a unit is destroy in Line of Fire, players first try to remove a copy of that card from their hand. If none are in their hand, they then search their discard, then their deck, then the reserve, and lastly remove the unit on the board that is being attacked. I personally love this approach, as I find searching for hold cards and seeing your supply slowly dwindling away to be far more of a tense experience than simply removing the card that was attacked. It's also through this method that if ever all of you or your opponent’s MOSS ROVs (the only unit type that can capture) are gone from the deployed regions, you lose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the box’s small footprint, Line of Fire provides a riveting strategic experience in a fairly short time frame. The matches I played rarely took even a half hour to complete, with games taking even less time the more experience both players have, as you can quickly play your three cards and be done. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The matches I played rarely took even a half hour to complete.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with both choices of cards being identical, there is still a good bit of strategy required in Line of Fire. Knowing what cards to add to your deck, where to deploy them, and when to retreat when a battlefield is lost are all key decisions you have to make. Being a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deck-building-board-games">deck-building game</a>, there is still some aspect of luck involved, as the cards you have in hand dictate what actions you can take on your turn – but I never found that luck overpowered solid tactics and decision making. That said, I did find that some of Line’s design direction made it harder to get into than I feel it really needed to be, with much of that coming down to the card designs and naming. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, I have not yet played Undaunted 2200: Callisto, so this may be less of an issue for some folks, but the naming of the ROVs threw my friends for a loop and never made sense. Terms like “infantry”, “tank”, and “sniper” I can grasp at a glance, but if you were to ask someone which of “MOSS”, “TIR”, “xED”, or “DaCU” was your heavy artillery unit, they would probably look at you and walk away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the random names and various symbols that make almost as little sense as the names, it just makes the cards harder to decipher than they need to be, even with the handy reference cards that both players have. I get that Line is set in the future and leans into the science fiction element, but sometimes it’s just easier to say “my tank is attacking your plane”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a visual and component standpoint, Line of Fire is a striking game, with artwork and designs that evoke classic science fiction book covers with blocky-square robots. Both players also have unique artwork for their units, that are also clearly denoted by heavy use of either redish-pink colors or blues for their respective side. This extends even into the storage solution with each player’s cards, fortifications and location tiles all fitting snuggly into a color-coordinated box, that both then are carried in a magnetically sealed box roughly the size of a VHS tape. I’m a sucker for games with good storage solutions, and Line of Fire’s does it’s job splendidly, making it quick and easy to set up and break down, and small enough to fit in your bag to take with you.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Line of Fire: Burnt Moon offers fans of both deck-building and strategy games a new game to add to their collections. It manages to bring much of the same tense tactical decision making of Osprey’s larger Undaunted series in a small box and only taking about a half hour to play. For those who enjoy playing games at their local coffee shop or brewery, or just likes to have a game or two with them when you have some downtime, Line of Fire may be worth checking out. I wouldn’t mind if Osprey releases official rules to allow for more players if you have multiple boxes, or a solo mode down the road. Regardless, Line of Fire: Burnt Moon has earned itself a place in my backpack, and wetted my appetite to dive into the Undaunted series proper.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/line-of-fire-burnt-moon-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-tripwire-interactive-launch-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tripwire-interactive-debuts-new-killing-floor-3-trailer-ahead-of-launch-next-week.1246689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive has released a new trailer for Killing Floor 3 ahead of its launch next week on July 24, 2025.</p>



<p>Technically, Killing Floor 3 should have been out for months by now. First announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-pc-ps5-xbox/">Gamescom 2023</a>, it was initially due to arrive on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25, 2025</a>. However, just a week into March, Tripwire Interactive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-delayed-to-later-in-2025/">the shooter would be delayed</a>, and though it didn't reveal a new release date at the time, it promised it would arrive sometime in 2025.</p>



<p>Two months later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/killing-floor-3-has-a-july-release-date-after-unexpected-march-delay/">in May</a>, Tripwire confirmed that the delay would only last four months, with a new release date set for July 24, 2025. Today's new launch trailer seems to confirm that there won't be any more unexpected delays, and that players can look forward to jumping onto the killing floor next week with their friends regardless of platform, since Killing Floor 3 will support full crossplay between PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, at launch.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUiT0fAExKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Killing Floor 3 takes place 70 years after the events of Killing Floor 2, and in that time, Horzine has created a horde of monstrous creatures called Zeds. Now, Mr. Foster and the Nightfall crew are the only thing standing between the army of Zeds and the rest of the world.</p>



<p>If this trailer is to be believed, then Killing Floor 3 will be an explosive and action-packed game. We'll see how players respond to it when it arrives next week. </p>

<p>Gamers of a certain age will remember a period roughly 15 years ago when the industry collectively decided <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/01/hands-on-3d-without-the-glasses-comes-into-focus-at-ces/">stereoscopic 3D was going to be the next big thing in gaming</a>. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2009/01/ces-2009-nvidia-shows-off-3d-glasses-with-left-4-dead/">Nvidia's "3D Vision" glasses system</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/01/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-3ds-at-ces/">Nintendo's glasses-free 3DS</a> to Sony's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/06/sony-announces-24-3d-playstation-tv-god-of-war-team-ico-3d-collections/">3D TV aimed specifically at gamers</a>, major gaming companies put a lot of effort into bringing a sense of real depth to the flat video game scenes of the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for those companies, the stereoscopic 3D gaming hype faded almost as quickly as it rose; by 2012, most companies were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/what-happened-to-the-stereoscopic-gaming-revolution/">scaling back their stereoscopic investments</a> in light of underwhelming public demand (case in point: Nintendo's pivot to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/hands-on-with-the-nintendo-2ds-surprisingly-small-and-comfortable/">the 3D-free 2DS</a> line of portables). And while <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/lenovo-adds-glasses-free-3d-to-a-27-inch-monitor-for-2999/">some stray</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/asus-new-16-inch-workstation-laptops-have-3d-oled-screens/">upstarts</a> have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/the-glasses-free-technology-that-made-me-believe-in-3d-tv-again/">tried to revive the stereoscopic gaming dream in the years since</a>, the idea seemed destined to be a footnote in gaming tech history.</p>
<p>Apparently, nobody told Samsung. The company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/samsung-is-the-next-company-to-try-to-popularize-3d-displays-again/">announced the Odyssey 3D earlier this year</a>, promising a glasses-free "light-field display" that could "create lifelike 3D images from 2D content by using a lenticular lens on the front panel." As a gamer with fond memories of the 3DS—and a general interest in seemingly doomed technology trends of all types—I was intrigued, to say the least.</p>
<p>After testing the retail version of the Samsung Odyssey 3D at Ars' orbiting HQ for a few weeks, I can say that the monitor delivers a stunning stereoscopic experience that reflects how much display technology has advanced in the last 15 years. Unfortunately, the limited selection of compatible games makes it hard to recommend to any PC gamer that doesn't have a "money is no object" budget to throw at its $2,000 MSRP.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>A jaw-dropping 3D effect</h2>
<p>Like previous glasses-free stereoscopic displays, the Odyssey 3D uses a thin, adjustable lenticular layer to direct slightly different images to each eye, resulting in a convincing sense of true depth that standard monitors can't provide. The Odyssey 3D comes with a built-in eye-tracking camera at the top, which does a good job quickly adjusting that lenticular positioning even as you move your head outside of the "sweet spot" directly in front of the display's center. When playing a stereoscopic game, you can also use keyboard shortcuts to adjust the apparent depth so it feels comfortable for your particular eyesight and interpupillary distance.</p>

<p>If your only experience with glasses-free stereoscopic 3D is the small, low-resolution display on the 3DS, the sheer impact of seeing a similar effect on the Odyssey 3D for the first time is hard to overstate. The overall impression is like looking into a magic diorama filled with animated characters come to life. The screen becomes merely the front panel through which you view this "magic box" scene, which seems to recede into the space behind the monitor in a way that can be a bit brain-breaking at first. After immersing yourself in the Odyssey 3D's stereoscopic 3D for a while, though, going back to a 3D game projected on a flat 2D plane feels a bit washed out and lifeless.</p>
<p>Much of the Odyssey 3D's stereoscopic impact comes down to its specs. A base 4K resolution and 165 Hz refresh rate means it can deliver a sharp and smooth 1080p image to each eye in stereoscopic mode, eliminating a lot of the blurriness and judder you might remember from the 3D displays of yesteryear. Add in a 27-inch diagonal display size that takes up a large portion of your field of vision (at desk distances), and it feels like you've been transported to an alternate reality where the industry has been consistently improving stereoscopic displays through over a decade of R&amp;D.</p>

      </figure>

<p>While the stereoscopic effect was overall comfortable for long periods in my tests, my eyes did have&nbsp; a bit of trouble focusing during occasional scenes where objects in the foreground end up obstructing the main game action in the background, such as errant blades of grass flitting in front of the camera in <em>Stray</em>. When this happens, the extreme difference in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vergence-accommodation_conflict">vergence</a> between the foreground objects and the background characters right next to them on the screen can create a blurry, eye-crossing distraction. While this effect is rare and short in most games I tested, it can be very uncomfortable when it does occur.</p>

<h2>Limited compatibility</h2>
<p>As impressive as the stereoscopic gaming experience is on the Odyssey 3D, it's also an experience that's disappointingly limited to a handful of games at the moment. The Samsung Reality Hub app—which you have to use to launch any stereoscopic content—currently only supports 14 titles, ranging from some recent hits (<em>Lies of P</em>, <em>Palworld</em>) to retro classics (three remastered <em>Grand Theft Auto Definitive Edition</em> games) to a few you've like never heard of (<em>Wigmund</em>, <em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em>).</p>
<p>Even if you somehow own all 14 of these titles, that still means your fancy new monitor's best feature can only be used on a minuscule subset of your PC gaming library. That's more than a bit galling in a monitor that costs two to four times as much as flat 2D displays with similar specs.</p>

<p>Using the required Samsung Reality app to even launch those few games is also an unnecessarily annoying experience, thanks to a bloated, overly busy stereoscopic front-end that caused my graphics card to spin up like a jet engine even before launching a game (Samsung recommends a GTX 3080 or higher to power the app and any stereoscopic games, but it didn't complain about my GTX 2080). Even after awkwardly registering my monitor-compatible games through the app, I often found they simply wouldn't launch in 3D through the app unless I reset my entire system, for some reason.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Aside from those handful of games, the only other "3D" option on your Odyssey 3D is watching 2D videos that have been given stereoscopic depth through an "AI-powered" algorithm. This worked better than I expected on the handful of YouTube videos I tested, but the 3D effect makes people and objects look a bit like cardboard cutouts arranged awkwardly in front of a flat background in the middle distance. That's a far cry from the convincing sense of depth you see in supported games. And while the effect is more impressive in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBRuzgBXa98&amp;list=PLAhgz6IKH9ywQb4TKxrrSshPfeWAmohL6&amp;index=2">side-by-side videos</a> designed specifically for stereoscopic display, it can be hard to find full-length&nbsp;3D films that actively support that display standard.</p>
<h2>Chicken meets egg</h2>
<p>While wider gaming compatibility for the Odyssey 3D could theoretically be coming down the road, adding that support would require active work by developers and publishers, which seem unlikely to put a lot of resources behind a niche stereoscopic standard that's currently only supported by one high-priced monitor. The potential audience that could justify this kind of development work seems unlikely to grow beyond a small niche until there are many more supported games to justify the purchase.</p>
<p>The only way out of that kind of chicken-and-egg support problem would be for Samsung to work with graphics card and/or game engine makers to add more or less automatic stereoscopic support to a wide swathe of current games, in a way similar to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">Valve's Proton layer automatically adding functional Linux support to thousands of Windows games</a>. Without that kind of broad-based solution, even a great stereoscopic experience like that on the Odyssey 3D seems destined to be yet another footnote in gaming tech history.</p>

It’s very good.</p><div catalogid="961f4751-8bef-40f8-8fd0-b1332007da05" id="218255"><div id="218255" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Flip 7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Eric Olsen and published by the OP Games, Flip 7 at its core is a push-your-luck game where players race to be the first to reach 200 points by playing cards blindly from a deck of cards that range from 0 to 12. For all the numbered cards (except zero), each card has as many copies as its value – there's a single 1-value card, two 2s, etc. A player's turn immediately ends if they ever pull a duplicate value card, they choose to pass their turn and take the points they have earned in that round, or if they manage to flip seven value cards, which also earns the player bonus points. Rounds continue until one player has reached those 200 points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a simple game, Flip 7 is visually striking with an Art Deco aesthetic and cards featuring bright colors and large numbers. Each number has its own color, with the modifier cards a bright honey-yellow that contrasts with the more tan-centric backgrounds of the number cards to avoid confusion. As a pleasant added touch, some of the frills and decorations on the cards connect seamlessly to one another, allowing you to create a lovely, rainbow-like collage of cards with each one you pull.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Flip 7 has such a low barrier of entry, really only requiring at least one of the players to be able to do simple math (even that you can mitigate somewhat thanks to the free tracking app), and with games only taking maybe 15 minutes, it makes it an easy recommendation for basically anyone. It’s a game that I could just as easily recommend for my friends I play heavy board games with, or my mom, who is more comfortable in the land of solitaire, and know that both audiences would have fun with it. The fact that this game scales up incredibly well, too, for parties is just an added cherry on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where Flip 7 may be a bit of a turn off for some folks comes from the fact that this game is, at its core, a game of pure luck, with the only strategy coming from whether or not you'll risk drawing another card to try for more points. Ideally, I would have loved if there was a smidge of a hint of an element that lends itself to strategy in here. Flip 7 fills very much the same spot as, say, an UNO or Skip-Bo, simpler games that appeal to a far broader market – but in those games, players have more choices they can make, as opposed to Flip 7’s only real choices it provides players is to either to draw a card or not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among my collection, I have a very elite selection of games, my Glove Box Collective. These are games I like to keep in my car’s glovebox so that I always have them on hand when I go places. These are games that I can bust out at a moment’s notice, when I have a few minutes to kill, when I’m meeting friends at a local brewery, or am simply visiting family. Flip 7, thanks largely to its quick-to-teach and easy-to-play nature, has earned its spot among this most prestigious collection of mine. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish that there was a bit more player choice involved but the tense “should I or shouldn’t I” nature of the game has led to some great moments of celebration where taking that risk has resulted in me winning a game, and those of frustration where I blew through all of my extra chance safety cards back-to-back only to still lose. But such is life in games of luck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zJgZNG?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aebrD5?object_uuid=2debdc3f-2f82-4286-a53c-3da72adc525b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 17, 2025 6:06 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Flip 7 is an easy recommendation regardless of your experience with card games, the size of your collection, or even your age.

This time around, unlike in the previous films, humans aren’t hopping into the digital world, but instead, programs and elements from “The Grid” are being manifested into reality. It’s a strange concept, but this new official trailer has sold me on it, at least aesthetically. Seeing Recognizers and Light Cycles in the real world is striking. </p><p>Here’s the new trailer from Disney: </p><p>Everything is going great in this trailer until we reach the 40-second mark, when we’re reminded that Jared Leto is the film’s star. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://airmail.news/issues/2025-6-7/the-cult-of-leto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier this year, at least nine women accused</a></span> the actor and musician of sexual misconduct.

Overall, he just has big creep vibes. So seeing him in the new <em>Tron </em>movie sucks.</p><p>On the flipside, Nine Inch Nails is handling the music for the film, and the first song off the <em>Tron: Ares </em>soundtrack sounds awesome. </p><p>Again, what a shame Leto is involved in what seems to be a really cool soft reboot of the <em>Tron </em>series. Even Jeff Bridges is back for this one. Great! Now, let’s digitally cut out Leto and replace him with someone who isn’t a dirtbag. </p><p><em>Tron Ares </em>hits theaters on October 10. Here’s the official synopsis from Disney: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Tron: Ares</em> follows a highly sophisticated Program, Ares, who is sent from the digital world into the real world on a dangerous mission, marking humankind’s first encounter with A.I. beings.</p></blockquote><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/tron-3-ares-jared-leto-trailer-official-nin-new-song-1851786513]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store has kicked off its new Summer Sale, which will run from today, July 17, to the end of the month on July 31, and while it'll feature a number of solid deals, its best deal is probably the fact that you can grab <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civ-vi-rise-and-fall-expanding-greatness/">Sid Meier's Civilization VI</a> for free.</p>



<p>Not just the base game for Civilization VI, mind you, but the Platinum Edition of the game, which includes its six DLC packs and two expansions. It's everything under the sun that's Civilization VI related, and the perfect deal for anyone who was perhaps unsure about jumping into Civilization VII.</p>
