			<p>Just four days after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official release of the Baldur's Gate 3 mod tools</a> and Larian's official partnership with Mod.io to <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3?_sort=downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">host the mods</a>, the website's mod downloads for the game are already at nearly five million and a half. The most popular Baldur's Gate 3 mods so far are:</p>
<ul>
<li>ImpUI (Improved UI) with 283K downloads</li>
<li>Faces of Faerun with 180K downloads</li>
<li>Adjustable Party Limit with 116K downloads</li>
<li>Kay's Hair Extensions with 108K downloads</li>
<li>Mod Manager Minor Fixes with 97K downloads</li>
<li>UnlockLevelCurve - Level 13-20 with 91K downloads</li>
<li>FaerunColors with 88K downloads</li>
<li>All Camp Clothes and Dyes with 82K downloads</li>
<li>Better Inventory UI with 70K downloads</li>
<li>Weightless Consumables with 67K downloads</li>
<li>Better Hotbar 2 with 65K downloads</li>
<li>Origin Feats with 61K downloads</li>
<li>LemonShaderBase with 60K downloads</li>
<li>Lemons AIO Pack 2 with 60K downloads</li>
<li>Lemon AIO Pack 1 with 55K downloads</li>
<li>ContainersExtended with 55K downloads</li>
<li>Kay's Hair Mod with 54K downloads</li>
<li>Leicarna's Piercings: Crystals with 54K downloads</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these are simply reposts on Mod.io of mods that were already available on Nexus and were made without the mod tools. Still, having access to the mod kit will allow modders to make new and potentially better Baldur's Gate 3 mods, so it's worth keeping an eye on the scene.</p>
<p>The implementation designed by Larian and Mod.io includes a built-in mod manager, which allows users to easily download and install mods within the game. This was particularly important to implement because Larian wanted Baldur's Gate 3 mods to work even on consoles, which would not allow the traditional PC modding tradition of downloading files from third-party websites and installing them in a more or less complicated fashion.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 isn't available yet on consoles (or Mac), but it is expected to launch next month, so you won't have too long to wait. We'll let you know once it goes live.</p>

			<p>The soon-to-be-released PC version of Final Fantasy XVI uses GDeflate, a GPU decompression standard, but it seems the technology still has a long way to go to bring significant improvements, judging from a recent comparison video based on the demo version.</p>
<p>The comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compusemble</a> puts the game running at 4K, 1440p, and 1080p resolutions with CPU and GPU decompression side by side, highlighting how there's no tangible performance benefit with GPU decompression. Loading times are also identically with CPU and GPU decompression, further highlighting how the technology still has a long way to go to bring significant improvements, although, according to Compusamble, Final Fantasy XVI's implementation of the technology is a step up from Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, as in the Insomniac Game, GPU decompression also impacted performance.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PlayStation 5 and will be released on PC on September 17th. You can learn more about the latest main entry in the series by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026.975579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/has-gta-6-been-delayed-to-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>New rumors suggest that GTA 6 has been delayed from its original 2025 release date to 2026, but how valid are the recent claims?</p>



<p><span>The latest GTA 6 rumor originated from X user (formerly Twitter)&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/billsyliamgta" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@billsyliamgta</a>, who claimed on the platform that GTA 6 has been internally delayed to 202</span>6, with the information coming from “multiple devs across two studios.” As of the time of writing, no one with a reputable track record has corroborated Liam’s claims, which is somewhat unusual considering the magnitude of GTA 6 and how big of a story a delay would be.</p>



<p>What’s particularly confusing about the original claims is that the user has sourced “multiple devs,” which makes the lack of public corroboration from reputable sources confusing. After all, such a big story with multiple devs reaching out to one person usually suggests that they’ve reached out to more people, or at the very least, a different developer at the studio has reached out to someone else to try and get the information leaked. But that seemingly doesn’t seem to be the case for the moment.</p>



<p>Jason Schreier, arguably the best investigative journalist in the industry, has already subtly (in my opinion, at least) implied that there’s currently no delay. On X, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1832842420020552153?s=46&amp;t=lDTUr8ci7tw7XnAHNA4Y_g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Schreier said</a>, “Way too many people interpreting this as “Jason says there’s no delay” when all I said is that I never said anything about commenting on it.” But with how reporting works, Schreier (and any reputable reporter) cannot flat-out say that there’s currently no delay, as that can easily change, especially when we’re still a good 14-15 months away from its presently intended release date.</p>



<p>Another way to look at this weird situation is without the initial rumor itself: Would a reputable reporter randomly report, “GTA 5 is still coming in 2025”? Probably not. Why? Because we already know officially that GTA 6 is scheduled to be released in 2025, so what value would that report add, and how stupid would that reporter look in a week if there was a delay?</p>



<p>For this reason, let me be absolutely clear; I have no idea if GTA 6 has been delayed. I haven’t reached out to anyone, and no one has reached out to me, but I wanted to explain the current rumor and whether you should note it or not. In my opinion, at least there doesn’t seem to be a delay for GTA 6. Rockstar Games’ track record does suggest that another delay could be coming down the road, but for now, that doesn’t seem like it’s been decided.</p>



<p>So, let’s just wait for the next GTA 6 rumor to pop up because it’s only a matter of time.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is officially scheduled to release in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

                <p>In September 2001, the original Silent Hill 2 set a new standard for the survival-horror genre in the PlayStation 2 era. Later this month, Konami's classic game is getting a remake from Bloober Team that is giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-preorder-guide/1100-6518983/" data-ref-id="1100-6518983">Silent Hill 2</a> a modern flourish. Now, an extended stream from 2BRO has revealed more of the changes in store for players as they explore the town of Silent Hill.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTxhiokIUxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZTxhiokIUxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The first 13 minutes of the stream serve as a reminder for how far games have come in the last 23 years by playing through the opening parts of the original Silent Hill 2. That game needed a loading screen just to bring its main character, James Sunderland, into a partially fenced-off area. The modern version of Silent Hill 2 appears to be a more seamless experience, and less reliant on fog to cover up its shortcomings.</p><p>At the beginning of the reboot, the tunnel to Silent Hill has been completely sealed off. That's why it takes James close to 20 minutes of gameplay to find his way to the town by going off the trail. James still encounters a young woman named Angela Orosco in a cemetery on the outskirts of town, but he doesn't run into any other main characters in this stream.</p><p>During this portion of the game, the only weapon that James has to rely on is a wooden board with some nails on it. That's good enough for him to dispatch the armless creatures that run around in the fog and occasionally hide under cars before attacking him. In a nice touch, James can use the board to break the windows of stores in town and bypass the doors by climbing through the openings. It also appears that there are more places to explore in this version of the game.</p><p>James is eventually drawn to a jukebox puzzle that he has to solve before he can advance and find a key that he needs. The music that plays appears to trigger a flashback for James, but since this demo is in Japanese, we can only assume that the scene in question relates to his quest to reunite with his late wife, Mary.</p><p>Silent Hill 2 will be released on PlayStation 5 and PC on October 8.</p>

			<p>A new Starfield mod brings significant visual improvements by overhauling interior lighting, effects, and ambient light.</p>
<p>The Enhanced Lights and FX, whose beta version can be downloaded for free from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/54?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, aims to create more atmospheric and realistic lighting by overhauling, as mentioned above, interior lighting, effects, and ambient light. This is achieved by making all interior light sources actually emit light, removing lights being cast from nowhere, increasing the use of reflection probes to improve reflections and indirect lighting, tweaking fog, redesigning light to make it more atmospheric, and more. Needless to say, the end results, even in the beta versions, are extremely good, as highlighted by the comparison screenshots below.</p>

<p>While modders are continuing to improve Starfield, Bethesda hasn't been idle either. Following the release of a few updates, the development studio is gearing up for the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-turns-one-today-and-bethesda-has-shared-some-new-shattered-space-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered Space expansion</a>, which promises to enhance the experience with new features and content.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With an engaging story, well-developed characters and lore, and a huge amount of meaningful content, Starfield is one of Bethesda's finest games and one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. The lack of seamless exploration and real innovation of the typical gameplay formula from the studio are noteworthy, but those willing to forego these issues will find a reactive and sprawling sci-fi universe to lose themselves in for hundreds, if not thousands, of hours.</em></p>

            <p>When Warner Bros <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">released a fairly abysmal trailer for the Minecraft Movie</a> last week, there could be only one possible result: the game's legions of fan filmmakers, modders, texture pack creators, and garden-variety players would attempt to upstage it. That process begins with the speedy release of several fan reworkings of the trailer that use something like vanilla Minecraft graphics, rather than the original, unholy fusion of LB Photo Realism and Jack Black. This'll teach Johnny Hollywood to run his grubby hands all over our beloved Creepers, eh.</p><!--more-->
<p>I've unearthed two of these reworkings so far. Both automatically look more charming than the movie, in the same way that having a nail pulled out of your leg is preferable to hammering another one in. The below is from Alumio, a 3D artist, modeller and animator who's known for making Five Nights At Freddy's videos using Minecraft's blocky visuals.</p>

<p>And here's one from QdAndy, who caveats that "I challenged myself to make it as fast as possible and thats why some of the stuff looks kindaaa weird? also its the best my potato Pc could do without exploding". Please bear in mind that in watching both of these videos you will be exposing yourself repeatedly to the soundtrack for the Magical Mystery Tour, a somewhat fusty late-career Beatles endeavour. Yes, I'm picking fights with both Warner Bros and Beatles fans in this post. We like our Mondays <em>spicy</em> round these parts. Come at me, groupies!</p>

<p>One thing from the trailer that seems to have won some guarded enthusiasm is the usage of Ghasts as hot air balloons, but the movie <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/12f1bo0/turned_the_ghast_into_a_hot_air_balloon_piloted/">can't claim to have invented the idea</a>. Those Ghasts from the trailers don't even have cannons on them!</p>

</span></p><p>All these shenanigans aside, I'm hoping that modders, texture and skin pack creators will start applying some of the more... obscure Minecraft aesthetics and traditions to what we've seen of the movie. Where are my <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/distorted-blocks-1-19/">glitchpack</a> reinventions? Please, Minecrafters, save us from Jack Black, Jason Momoa and all their doings.

<p>The series quickly became a hit for the streaming service, with scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p>

<p>Now, during this weekend's Creative Arts Emmy Awards, it was announced Fallout had won two accolades: Outstanding Music Supervision and Outstanding Emerging Media Program.</p>
<p>Fallout won the <a href="https://x.com/TelevisionAcad/status/1832585341435342897">Outstanding Emerging Media Program</a> award for its interactive website known as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/salp/fallout?tag=georiot-us-default-20&amp;ascsubtag=pcg-gb-3501703158991930027-20&amp;geniuslink=true&amp;hhf">Fallout: Vault 33</a>. This site allows users to explore Vault 33 and the wasteland by listening to songs such as "I don't want to set the world on fire" by The Ink Spots and "Stars and Stripes Forever" by the US Marine Corps Band on a virtual record player, playing a number of promo videos for the show and swinging by Ma June's for a visit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the show's music supervisor <a href="https://x.com/TelevisionAcad/status/1832965673389068767">Trygge Toven</a> was honoured with the Outstanding Music Supervision award.</p>
<p>In addition to its wins, Fallout was also nominated across several other categories, including a deserved nod for Goggins' portrayal of The Ghoul and the prosthetic makeup team.</p>

<p>Fallout is not the only video game adaptation to win at the Emmys. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">The Last of Us series won eight Emmys</a> earlier this year, including awards for picture editing, main title design, prosthetic makeup, sound editing, sound mixing, and visual effects. In addition, Storm Reid won the award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series and Nick Offerman won the award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated take on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> Arcane <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p>

<p>As for what is next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Fallout was renewed for a second season</a> soon after the show made its debut in April. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they "can't wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>And when will that be? Well, we don't have a date just yet, but Fallout's showrunners say they want to get the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Halo 5: Guardians, as well as other Xbox One exclusives, will soon become playable on PC thanks to a new Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs.</p>
<p>XWine1, which was revealed with a tweet on X, is an Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs that currently runs six games properly. Among these games are Halo 5: Guardians, which hasn't been ported to PC to date, Rare Replay, Crimson Dragon, Forza Motorsport 5, Powerstar Golf, Space Jam: A New Legacy - The Game, Forza Motorsport 6, Forza Horizon 2 and CrossfireX. Unfortunately, the translation layer is not available to the public yet, and when it does, it's likely the development team will end up open sourcing the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Introducing XWine1, an Xbox One translation layer for Windows PCs.<br>
Currently six games are fully playable, with others reaching logos and in-game. More news to come! <a href="https://t.co/Du6puJz6Dj">pic.twitter.com/Du6puJz6Dj</a></p>
<p>— XWine1 (@XWineOne) <a href="https://twitter.com/XWineOne/status/1832740078658974168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Where's the source code?</p>
<p>— AE KXZ (@cnrd0o) <a href="https://twitter.com/cnrd0o/status/1832743252241310067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The past few months have been filled with great news for PC players who haven't had the chance to try out some of the best console-exclusive games released in the past console generation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-dynamic-shadows/">Bloodborne</a>, just like Halo 5: Guardians, has yet to be ported to PC, but the amazing progress the ShadPS4 emulator has been making suggests that it won't be much longer until PC players will be able to venture into Yarnham.</p>
<p>Halo 5: Guardians is now available on Xbox One, but it can also be played on any device that supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. More information on the fifth entry in the series can be found on the franchise's <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-gb">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Hack the planet, wizard fans. A modder has cracked open some previously disabled abilities in the official modding toolkit for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, making it possible for folks to create their own levels or alter the game's existing environments. The toolkit (which was only made available last week) previously wouldn't let you do any of that, due to "technical constraints and platform-specific guidelines," according to developers Larian. But modders neither care nor sleep. It took them just two days to worm their way into the devkit's innards and make the impossible possible.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>To give you some context, last week the developers released a hefty patch that added a bunch of new endings to the fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>. But included in that patch was official mod support and the modding toolkit. It was made available to help the usual sickos continue working on new hairstyles, customised weapons, and, uh, "other" material. The kit is essentially a watered-down version of what developers Larian would use in the studio, with some of the more powerful features disabled. You could view the game's levels in "read-only" mode, for instance, but you couldn't alter those environments, nor make your own levels. Until enterprising modder "Siegre" stuck a lockpick into the devkit and made everything possible, that is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=description">BG3 Toolkit Unlocked</a> is available on Nexus Mods (at the time of writing, at least) and has a simple description: "This mod unlocks all the disabled features and enables write permissions for the BG3 Toolkit. Including level editing, save editing, and more." As a demonstration, some accompanying images include a level being filled with random environmental pieces like ruined columns, bell towers, and webs of glistening flesh. Mmmmmm, game development. </p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-siegfre-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>"Siegfre"</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's not 100% clear why Larian didn't include these features in the toolkit to begin with, but it may be a case of protecting certain copyrighted assets being scraped easily from the game, or from being altered in a way that is unpleasing to DnD's intellectual property overlords. "Baldur’s Gate 3, as a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game licensed by our partners, has certain guidelines in place to ensure the integrity of the game’s universe," they said in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-27-official-modding-support_118?mc_cid=62c7d6b649">the notes for last week's patch</a>, suggesting the restrictions to the modding kit went beyond the studio's control. </p>
<p>It's also possible they didn't want to muddy the official mod library with mods that would cause technical and certification problems on consoles. They already have to watch out for willies in the official in-game mod launcher, for example, even if the studio don't mind PC players continuing to make that kind of thing on Nexus Mods and so on. "While some NSFW mods and certain script-heavy modifications may not be supported through the official pipeline," they said, "modding outside of our pipeline will still be an option."</p>
<p>And what an option. The moral of this story is that there's always someone out there willing to take a big boltcutter to the words "read-only". It will be interesting to see what modders can create with the toolkit now entirely unlocked. The studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity Original Sin 2</a>, allowed modders to make full campaigns of their own using a huge asset library from the game. For the same thing to be possible in Baldur's Gate 3 - however technically difficult - may lead to some impressive creations filled with many more dungeons and/or dragons. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ah, but think of the exposure… Go f*** yourself.”</p><p>IGN has asked Rockstar for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/gettyimages-1793840515-1725871614837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Martyn Ware of Heaven 17 performs on stage at the O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire on November 14, 2023 in London, England. (Photo by C Brandon/Redferns)</figcaption></figure></output><p>Ware’s tweet includes a figure for money made by GTA 6, which obviously isn’t out yet. Predecessor GTA 5 is the second best-selling video game of all-time with an eye-watering 200 million sold, so perhaps the figure relates to an estimate of earnings from that game (Rockstar parent company Take-Two has not disclosed a GTA-specific revenue figure.)</p><p>Ware later <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832652897676394782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to clarify that the $7,500 offer was $7,500 for each of Temptation's three writers, which amounts to $22,500 total. "Still utterly unacceptable," he added.</p><p>Either way, Ware’s point that GTA makes a huge amount of money and therefore the offer to use Temptation should be significantly higher is clear. And in subsequent tweets, despite many replies suggesting he should take the money and enjoy the “exposure” offered by having Temptation appear in what is likely the biggest video game of all time, <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832661703554728237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ware doubled down</a>, saying: “For those claiming H17 should have accepted the extremely low offer for buyout for Temptation in GTA6 claiming ‘increased exposure’… An extra 1 million streams generates each writer a pitiful $1k each.”</p><p>Then, replying to another user who suggested $7,500 would be “better than nothing,” <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832675363421397126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ware said</a>: “Get off your knees.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Grand Theft Auto 6 vs Real Life Inspiration</h3></div></output><p>Rockstar has a long-standing relationship with the music industry, and the soundtracks to its games are among the most popular in all video games. Indeed, the GTA games’ radio stations are often as memorable as the games themselves, providing as they do the backdrop to players’ antics with each new release. GTA 5 has hundreds of licensed songs that play out over its many in-game radio stations, and it’s likely GTA 6 will go even bigger in this regard. Having a song in GTA 6 will provide significant brand recognition, of course, but Ware’s tweets have sparked a discussion about whether $7,500 is enough for a single track’s inclusion in what may end up being the best-selling and most-played video game of all time.</p><p>It feels like an age since Rockstar broke the internet by releasing the debut trailer for GTA 6. Since the December 2023 release of GTA 6 Trailer 1, as it’s called, information-hungry fans have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-gta-fan-spots-a-single-piece-of-jewelry-from-the-gta-6-trailer-in-the-new-gta-online-update">analyzed the trailer to within an inch of its life</a>, coming up with all sorts of outlandish theories and predictions about what to expect when Rockstar finally releases the game next year. Set in modern-day Leonida, a fictionalized version of Florida, GTA 6 will let players control Lucia and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-protagonist-isnt-played-by-the-last-of-us-star-troy-baker"><u>an unnamed male</u></a> that some fans speculate is named Jason.</p><p>Questions have swirled around GTA 6's release date ever since the initial reveal, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-website-changes-hinting-at-new-screenshots-has-fans-going-feral"><u>fans going feral over details like website updates</u></a>. Internal conflict over Rockstar's return to office policy has led to questions over whether <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns"><u>GTA 6 will ultimately be delayed into 2026</u></a>. However, as of right now, it looks like Rockstar is determined to get GTA 6 out the door during its intended release window of fall 2025.</p><p><em>Photo by C Brandon/Redferns</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

For starters, he doesn't agree with OpenAI's methods or business model, but being targeted by the company also drove a wrecking ball through a free resource he'd spent five years building.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I first noticed that the database was having issues a couple of weeks ago, when pages were taking a lot longer to load. I knew this had nothing to do with the site itself because it had always run smoothly (even with more active online users), so I suspected foul play but couldn’t find any evidence at the time," Coates told Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I was unable to release any updates to the site as the lag was interfering with my admin tools, and I was even getting angry emails and messages from users who rely on the site as part of their day-to-day workflow."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He explained the disruption eventually caused the website to stop working altogether, dishing out "502 Bad Gateway" errors to users. At that stage, Coates sought the help of Jay Peet, who hosted the database on their private server for the last five years. Peet looked at the site logs and realized the website's resources were being swallowed by a single IP address belonging to OpenAI.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The homepage was being reloaded 200 times a second, as the [OpenAI] bot was apparently struggling to find its way around the site and getting stuck in a continuous loop," added Coates.

In fact, they actually run the website at a loss. If, however, they had attempted to monetize the project or leveraged external tools such as Amazon Web Services, OpenAI's unwelcome interest might have caused financial harm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If I were relying on [Game UI Database] for ad-revenue or membership fees, the downtime caused by OpenAI would have&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;had an impact on my income," he said. "They were transferring ~70GB of data from the server every ten minutes. Fortunately, I have no bandwidth costs and minimal server fees, so I’m able to provide this resource to everyone for free (as all educational resources should be). But if I were paying AWS for storage, for example, this bandwidth would have cost me around £850 a day."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"OpenAI aren't even being transparent about where their data is coming from, so I would have been solely responsible for that bill. How is that fair or even legal? And I'm certainly not the only one being affected by this."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coates said the issue is more profound than a potential loss of income, though. "Don't get me started on what they're doing with this data," he continued, pointing out that he spent years meticulously collecting and cataloguing UI references to help other creatives in the game industry only to have that work (which encompasses the efforts of thousands of developers) "stolen by a multi-billion dollar organization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Coates said the idea that OpenAI is repurposing that work to "hurt and replace the people that I'm trying to help" only adds insult to injury. "It's sick. Generative&nbsp;AI technology simply wouldn't exist without the work of human creatives, and yet we are the ones here being punished without compensation or credit," they added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how Game UI Database succeeded in rebuffing OpenAI's advances, Coates and Peet eventually blocked all of the company's associated IPs at the HTTP server level to prevent it from deploying a workaround.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When I investigated this problem, it was apparent that we were being scraped or crawled by something. Our usage analytics showed 10 active users, while the actual server was reporting 200 to 300 active requests," said Peet.

            <p>Astro Bot is set to receive DLC with more yet-to-be-revealed VIP bots, though the game's credits hint towards which characters we may see.</p>
<p>The free DLC will arrive this year, confirmed Team Asobi's Nicolas Doucet in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIqH3c3Agw">Quest Daily</a>, but it will be "small" and focus on speedruns following its popularity in Astro's Playroom. Leaderboards will be included.</p>
<p>What's more, "some characters that we didn't include yet will appear," said Doucet.</p>

<p>The DLC will focus on challenging levels, but the team will also add a "toy feeling" suitable for any players, Doucet continued, though "we're not too sure about that one".</p>
<p>However, while Doucet didn't confirm which VIP bots were on the way, the game's credits do provide hints.</p>
<p><strong>Stop here if you want to avoid potential spoilers.</strong></p>
<p>Team Asobi thanks third-party publishers for use of their characters in the credits, but there are some here that don't currently appear in the game.</p>
<p>Those companies include: Shift Up and the use of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>; Ubisoft and the use of Rayman, Beyond Good &amp; Evil, and Assassin's Creed; Koei Tecmo and the use of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">Rise of the Ronin</a>; and Argonaut Games for the use of Croc.</p>
<p>Of course, Team Asobi may have licensed these characters and chosen not to include them. But with more bots now confirmed to be in the DLC, there's a fair chance we may see these characters in some form.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-has-lots-of-bots-but-concept-arts-got-those-that-are-not">Other characters were seen in concept art</a>, but also do not appear in the game - including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fat-princess">Fat Princess</a>, and Sweet Tooth from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/twisted-metal">Twisted Metal</a>.</p>
<p>Astro Bot released on Friday last week to much fanfare and celebration.</p>
<p>"Sony's glossy mascot gets an outing filled with imagination and loving craft," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Eurogamer Astro Bot review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>If you are playing the very excellent Astro Bot you may have encountered a very <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-save-warning-you-have-to-exit-via-the-dashboard-to-make-a-save-doing-otherwise-leads-to-no-save-being-made-i-lost-5-hours-progress.974571/">annoying bug</a>.&nbsp; Although the game autosaves your progress it seems that for some people the file is not completed saved unless you properly exit the game, if you just shut down the PS5 or crash, you may lose your save.</p>
<p>The work around for the Astro Bot save bug is simple if a little annoying. All you have to do is exit out to the main menu while you are playing to ensure the data is saved. If you have a long gaming session then we suggest you do this quite regularly just in case you hit any issues.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We, like many sites, gave Astro Bot our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">top score of 10/10.</a></p>
<p>“Just as with Playroom, Astro Bot is a game that absolutely celebrates all things PlayStation, aimed at anyone and everyone who loves this console and the games that have made it what it is,” said Nic. “Whether you’re an old timer or a young kid with their first console — or better yet, a combination of the two — there are dozens of hours of fun to be mined here. It’s a fun, easy-going romp through PlayStation history, and absolutely impossible to play without a smile plastered to your face.”</p>

<p>Astro Bot currently has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/astro-bot/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5">Metacritic score </a>of 94 with 100% positive reviews, a nice win for Sony which they probably needed after the mess that was Concord.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TeamAsobi">Team Asobi</a> have yet to comment on Astro Bot save bug but as there are many reports of it out in the wild I would expect a patch to be released as quickly as possible.</p>

		<p>Martyn&nbsp; Wear from Heaven 17 has revealed that Rockstar asked to use the classic track “Temptation” in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6/"> Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, and he was initially excited.&nbsp; The excitement soon faded when he saw what they were offering., “IT WAS $7500 – for a buyout of any future royalties from the game – forever…”</p>



<p>In other words Heaven 17 would get just $7500 and that’s it, doesn’t matter how many copies of the game were sold. To explain why Martyn is annoyed you need to know how the music industry works, specifically compilation albums. If you get a track signed to a compilation you get a one off fee no matter how many copies are sold, and then a (very small) percentage of every copy over a certain number. For example you may get 10k up front, and then a percentage after 50,000 sales.</p>
<p>GTA V has sold over 200 million copies and the radio stations are essentially compilation albums, albeit in game, so you can see Martyn’s side of the argument, artists should get paid for their work.</p>

<p>Sadly many people online are attacking Martyn saying he should be grateful for the “exposure” of being in a high profile game. To reiterate the well worn saying, exposure does not pay bills.</p>
<p>Have a bop to the original version of Temptation below or if you’re feeling epic, try the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6nK3EHYIiE">11 minute Brothers in Rhythm Remix.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>Autumn is upon us, or "fall" if you're from the other side of the pond. The leaves flake from the boughs like the dandruff of Pan, god of the wild - pandruff, perhaps? The waters of the rivers thicken, rejecting the fading sunlight, and the big coffee chains start doing monstrous things with hazelnut syrup. The Maw is ascendant during the darker months, its constellations growing visible to the naked eye. We will need a steady dosage of new PC games to keep it quiescent. Fortunately, this week is looking quite bountiful.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 9th September kicks off thunderously with the full public launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. Find comedy racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/what-the-car">What The Car?</a> running alongside the Warhammer behemoth like, well, a car with legs running alongside a Space Marine. On Tuesday 10th September, there's revenge thriller FPS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a>, created by a few of the terrible tinkerers behind El Paso, Elsewhere, and the early access launch of action-RPG brawler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/towerborne">Towerborne</a>, created by a few of the mournful intellects behind The Banner Saga. On Wednesday 11th September, make way for farm simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirthwood">Mirthwood</a>, which is sort of Stardew Valley but more storybook. On Thursday 12th September, it's an avalanche: the early access launch of witchy chicken-legged house sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reka">Reka</a>, closely pursued by dystopian blood racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathsprint-66">Deathsprint 66</a>, cosy open world van adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caravan-sandwitch">Caravan Sandwitch</a>, spacey six-shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wild-bastards">Wild Bastards</a>, PS2-inspired sci-fi horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2123640/Hollowbody/">Hollowbody</a>, and open world racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown </a>. On Friday 13th September, finally, a choice of revolutionary period photography  in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1851090/Mexico_1921_A_Deep_Slumber/">Mexico, 1921: A Deep Slumber</a>, creepy card-dungeoneering in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pyrene">Pyrene</a>, and teenage cabin fever in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2578910/Nocturnals/">Nocturnals</a>.</p>
<p>Phew! Too much? Probably too much. As ever, it's possible that all of the above games are actually rubbish, and there are a bunch of other games I haven't mentioned that you should play instead. What was I thinking? Be sure to tell me so in the comments, and follow our weekly newsgatherings in the liveblog below. Have a lovely autumnal week.</p><div data-live="true">

            <p>Well, if this isn’t a vastly impressive little gem I’m not sure what is. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/qanga">Qanga</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> exploration game set in a loading screen-less solar system. It features ship travel, combat, trade, and base building, and you can do all of it alone or with space mates. It’s got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1648190/QANGA/">a demo</a>, but it’s also on the cheaper end if you fancy buying into early access. Considering the pricing, I’d say it’s a real looker, too.</p>

			<p>One of the main pain points criticized by Star Wars Outlaws fans are those highly annoying instant fail stealth missions, where often the player doesn't even have time to react to an enemy spotting them.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Ubisoft Massive is well aware of the feedback, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by Gamesradar. Creative Director Julian Gerighty revealed a patch will soon be released to improve those situations.</p>
<p><em> Especially, I mean, you're probably thinking of one of the early missions in Mirogana, which is incredibly punishing. And for me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving. I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low-hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable.</em></p>
<p><em>We just don't want it to feel unfair. And today, I think it feels unfair. And believe it or not, this wasn't our intention. This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so, and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Mathias Karlson added:</p>
<p><em>We want players to be in that knife edge range between, 'okay, I'm completely in stealth, oh shit: They're about to see me. They saw me, but I can still do something about it, as long as I don't raise the alarm. I can create chaos locally to be able to avoid that happening.' However, if that turns out to not connect with its current tuning and with enough people, it's, of course, something we take very, very seriously, and we'll consider.</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft Massive previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-director-admits-review-score-disappointment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they weren't fully happy with the critical reception of Star Wars Outlaws, suggesting they'll do their utmost to further improve the game with the patches and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned DLCs</a>. By the way, the critical reception also caused Ubisoft stocks to take a dive.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws'</a> next patch aims to tone down some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a>’s “incredibly punishing” insta-fail stealth sections, alongside adding tweaks for “narrative context” at other points in the story. That’s according to creative director Julian Gerighty, who recently <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about what players should expect in the next update, coming “maybe in 10 days.”</p>

<p>“You're probably thinking of one of the early missions in Mirogana, which is incredibly punishing. And for me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving,” said Gerighty. "I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p>
<p>Players should be "in that knife edge range between, 'okay, I'm completely in stealth, oh shit: They're about to see me. They saw me, but I can still do something about it, as long as I don't raise the alarm. I can create chaos locally to be able to avoid that happening,” added Director Mathias Karlson.</p>
<p>For my money, it’s not the forced stealth in Star Wars Outlaws that were necessarily the issue, more that Kay has very few interesting tools to overcome them.</p>
<p>Gerighty also went on to mention tweaking certain elements of story context at other points in the game.</p>
<p>"if you tell me today that that's a blocker for people enjoying the game, then we're going to tweak the narrative context, right? We'll have an announcement on the PA saying [does pretend PA voice] 'well, stormtroopers have gone down Toshara and now we have the skeleton crew on site.' The context will change, just so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible."</p>
<p>Thank you, GamesRadar+. [Does pretend PA voice] is my favourite use of those journo brackets I’ve seen in a very long time.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to get enthusiastic about Outlaws’ weak stealth and combat, film-set worlds, and half-hearted nods at a more conceptually experimental game,” said I in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. “Still, it’s a perfectly ok bit of Star Wars entertainment with some great, authentic moments.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Any ambitions you may have had to relive <a href="https://youtu.be/i2Yqdm2AKk0">that scene</a> from Trainspotting in the nightclubs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> have been cruelly dashed. Martyn Ware - of 80's synthpop band Heaven 17 - <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832360363179868488">took to Xitter</a> over the weekend to share his experience of Rockstar games attempting to licence his song Temptation. The offer, which Ware describes as for “a buyout of any future royalties from the game”, was allegedly for $7500.</p>

<p>“I was recently contacted by my publishers on behalf of Rockstar Games re the possibility of using Temptation on the new Grand Theft Auto 6,” wrote Ware, who was also one of the founding members of The Human League - he left before they composed <a href="https://youtu.be/0tRTCeRyC_Y">Keep Feeling Fascination</a>, which featured in Vice City.</p>
<p>“Naturally excited about the immense wealth that was about to head my way, I scrolled to the bottom of the email re the offer…IT WAS $7500 - for a buyout of any future royalties from the game - forever. To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 [sic] grossed, wait for it…$8.6 BILLION. Ah, but think of the exposure…Go fuck yourself”</p>
<p>From my laymen’s perspective, it seems the mention of a “full buyout” might be the issue here. Games often have to renegotiate soundtrack royalties for remasters and the like. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/qqv22u/many_songs_from_the_original_games_are_not/">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> itself was missing several songs from the originals. Last week, <a href="https://x.com/alanwake/status/1831739167392272866">Remedy announced</a> that an update to Alan Wake would remove David Bowie’s Space Oddity from the game. Now, I’m just a simple country lawyer, but it might be that Rockstar are trying to avoid something similar by gobbling up the full rights to any tracks for GTA 6.</p>
<p>For a bit more context, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/how-does-the-games-industry-solve-its-problem-with-music-licensing">here’s a thorough piece</a> on music licensing from Matt Ombler at GI.biz.</p>
<blockquote><p>"If you want to use music that's written by someone like Kanye West you can easily spend between $100,000 to $200,000 on a single track," Gross explains. "Sometimes labels are willing to lower rates if you choose a selection of tracks, or choose to feature music from an artist that might be up and coming. Games like FIFA and Grand Theft Auto are trend-setters for music. If you're an upcoming artist and you can get your music featured in games like these it can launch your career."</p></blockquote>
<p>Back in April, GTA 6 publishers Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">laid off five per cent of their staff</a>, equating to hundreds of job losses. GTA 6 itself is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">apparently out next fall</a>. Don't read the replies to Ware's tweet if you want to have a good Monday.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>It's rare that a game, one that hasn't had a groundswell of support for a sequel over the past decade - and one that isn't tied into a nostalgic trend, gets a sequel so long after the original. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the 2024 sequel to the 2011 game, naturally made by a completely different developer under a completely different publisher due to the death of THQ. It's not that the original wasn't successful; it was one of THQ's few success stories during their final years, but with so much time passed, will this be the sequel that propels the game forward into the collective consciousness?</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Warhammer-40000-Space-Marine-2-Review-02-Shooty.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I must start by admitting my initial time with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was not good. Even just launching the game, there were more than a few crashes, and the early video wouldn't play once I got in. The footage was doing nothing but playing the audio in the background. When I got into the tutorial, following some significant loading, it was pretty jittery. I thought the worst might come as I progressed through the campaign, and while things improved, I can understand why the game was delayed and the beta was cancelled.</p>
<p>Now, I will say that things did improve. I'm unsure why the first half-hour felt like my rig suddenly reverted to an older system, but the gameplay was smooth afterwards. I can't say the same for cutscenes. The audio never matched the video, not once. The lips were always about two to three seconds away from the voices, making me feel like I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MigPWBhPzTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kung Pow: Enter the Fist</a>. I must also point out that watching "loading resources" and the bar tick-up was interminably dull every time I launched the game. I've found the loading throughout far longer than I recall in most games. I've also had a few issues when loading textures took a little time.</p>
<p>I may as well stick with the negatives for now. There is no reason for me to be connected to your server or for you to boot me out if it drops. I have played the core missions with the AI controlling my two companions. There's no gain in kicking me out because I had to pause the game and leave the computer for a prolonged period. Take it for granted that when I click to play solo, I don't want to be connected to your damn server, and I don't need to be.</p>

<p>On a somewhat negative note, I found the combat of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 boring after a while. Now, this will be very subjective, and I can imagine other people will thoroughly enjoy the combat, but what started as reasonable enjoyment turned into tedium quite quickly. As expected from an Ultramarine, you are a god amongst men, able to take down thousands. You will mow through hordes of Tyranids; the little ones merely bounce off you while the larger enemies, towering above the fray, will pose a slight bit more of a challenge, but the combat system will make it so your godliness is absolute.</p>
<p>So far, so good. The problem comes with how the combat system balances health and armour. To recover armour specifically, you want to perform executions. You do this by causing enough damage to an enemy that they get stunned, and then you press the required button, and the execution happens. This execution naturally finishes the enemy but also restores some armour. If you don't perform them, you will eventually die, which means they become essential. It also means you will be running around, searching for the flashing red enemy, pressing the button to stay alive (by killing them).</p>
<p>What this essentially means is that you always want to be in melee range, which negates some of the close-range guns, which I found to be worthless for the most part. I don't think all ranged weapons are worthless, if only because you get some ranged enemies - and it's nice to thin the horde from afar, if only for it being cool. There are also a few flying enemies for which you need ranged weapons. You'll also get some grenades you carry in minimal numbers, which I didn't find incredibly useful.</p>
<p>This naturally leaves the melee, and while there are a few weapons, and each has combos, it does become quite the same after a short time. Heavy attack to stun the little buggers, get some executions in, a mix of attacks for the bigger things, when they flash red, execute. You'll also want to watch for some blue and red crosshairs; if it's blue, you can parry; if it's red, you need to dodge. Then it's back to execution city. If I were honest, by the end of the second campaign mission, I was hoping and praying something would change. The game does throw in a few things here and there to spice it up, but it never really evolves.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Warhammer-40000-Space-Marine-2-Review-04-Setting-Up.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Which is a shame because the campaign is quite meaty. It takes place across six missions (not including the tutorial), which doesn't sound like a lot, but some are the equivalent of three or four of a regular game's mission; you'll also have six others for co-op play. These six separate levels tell the story of three other random characters you send off to perform a task while doing whatever you're doing in the main story.</p>
<p>If there's anything to say about the missions, they know exactly what they want to do and achieve it perfectly. The linear move from set-piece to set-piece works well in Space Marine 2. Oddly, it doesn't get boring like I would get bored in most games that do this, if only because the world and environments keep it interesting. Saber Interactive has undoubtedly improved their World War Z outing, learning and building on that, swapping the Zombies out for Tyranids (and more, as the game develops).</p>
<p>Of course, the co-op missions are where Saber hopes you'll keep coming back for more, but I can't honestly see myself doing that. There is some development in this, allowing you to unlock new weapons, but the elephant in the room will always be <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darktide</a>. They are and feel like different games, but it's hard to ignore the pure 40k co-op action game when wanting to play 40k co-op action. Still, if you are interested in the story, playing a few challenging missions with friends, particularly if you're enjoying the combat, will be a draw, particularly with the promise of more to come.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Warhammer-40000-Space-Marine-2-Review-05-Class-System.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In all, while Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel.</p>

<p>The Halo Championship Series’ Salt Lake City Major has wrapped and Spacestation has another trophy for the cabinet. In a dominating grand final, the team fighting on home turf handed yet another second-place finish to OpTic Gaming, the third the squad landed this year.</p>



<p>However, it isn’t a win without its fair share of issues. Spacestation’s win has been branded ‘reset cheese’ owing to the number of restarts initiated by SSG – especially when they were losing a map. It’s a mixed bag in the debate, though – Spacestation’s resets also came when the team was <strong>winning maps.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-championship">To The Championship</h2>



<p>OpTic Gaming might have fallen short of winning the grand prize <strong>yet again</strong>, but now the team can look forward to the Halo World Championship, which is taking place in Seattle between October 4 – 6. Sadly, this is the <strong>fourth </strong>major second-place finish for the team in under a year, all of which have been handed down by either Spacestation or FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>OpTic Gaming steamed quite nicely through the bracket in Salt Lake City, with the squad looking as sharp as possible in front of the crowd. In back-to-back fixtures, the OpTic side defeated Spacestation, FaZe Clan, and Shopify Rebellion, but SSG going on a lower bracket run and bursting into the grand final proved to be too much to handle. </p>



<p>To face OpTic again, SSG effectively dealt with Cloud9, ITB, Complexity, FaZe Clan, and Rebellion. That’s what you call revenge with a vengeance.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the issue surrounding the resets proved to be a sticking point for both the fans and the competitors, with OpTic’s FormaL making comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The resets definitely sucked. Being in a grand final and being taken out of the moment over and over was unfortunate, and probably should have had some repercussions if it was a player’s equipment multiple times. The fans were definitely being very disrespectful but I’ve also seen OpTic fans do the same. Was definitely over the top but I get it.</p>

It will be smaller. You know it’s not going to be like, you know, a huge, huge amount, but it will be focusing on one of the features that people enjoyed in <em><a title="Games > ASTRO's PLAYROOM [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astros-playroom">ASTRO’s PLAYROOM</a></em>—that was the speedruns. You know, there were some speedruns, and the levels were quite short, but it was the fact that you could replay and keep shaving time off… with some new VIP bots to rescue, so some characters we didn’t include yet will appear. But yeah, that’s going to come, and that’s going to focus really on kind-of challenging levels. But if we can, we’d like to also insert something a bit toy-feeling, something that could be really like for any player. But we’re not too sure about that one. But the challenging stuff is definitely coming.”</p><p>Asked if the speedrun downloadable content will include leaderboards, Doucet confirmed with a simple, “Yes.”</p><p>Speaking of VIP bots, the credits for <em>ASTRO BOT</em> mention trademarks for several properties that did not appear as VIP bots in the game, including:</p><div id="accordion__container_astrobotcredits"><p id="heading_astrobotcredits_list"><h5><a type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#collapse_astrobotcredits_list" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapse_astrobotcredits_list">Spoilers: Trademarks in ASTRO BOT Credits</a></h5></p><div id="collapse_astrobotcredits_list" aria-labelledby="heading_astrobotcredits_list"><ul><li><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (Ubisoft)</li><li><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> (Ubisoft)</li><li><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</em> (Argonaut Games)</li><li><em>Rayman</em> (Ubisoft)</li><li><em>Rise of the Ronin</em> (Koei Tecmo)</li><li><em>Stellar Blade</em> (SHIFT UP)</li><li><em>Worms</em> (Team17)</li></ul></div></div><p><em>ASTRO BOT</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,884 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Two-thirds of female players still report being harassed when playing online.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-gaming-still-has-a-women-problem-13210551">report</a> entitled "Why gaming still has a women problem", Sky News reflected on the propensity of misogyny and hatred against women in gaming spaces, particularly on Discord and in multiplayer games.</p>

<p>In primary research conducted for the report, tech journalist Mickey Carroll said she was harassed and called a host of slurs simply because her "profile picture showed that [she] was clearly a woman".</p>
<p>After receiving abuse on Discord "within seconds", Carroll asked the abuser to justify their position. In response, the male gamer said:</p>
<p>"You're female. You're a filthy female. We don't like females, we like men in here. You're a slag. You know that, right? Because you're a fucking female, all females are slags, and you're expired. You're a slag on the streets, bruv. Bro, she's a nonce, she's a paedophile, she's a nonce, she loves kids."</p>
<p>The research – conducted by Bryter's Jenny McBean – found abuse typically starts off as "sexist comments", "but it often escalates into something more threatening; rape threats, male gamers saying, 'I'm going to find out where you live, attack your family and attack you'."</p>
<p>Of the "around a thousand" female gamers polled across the UK and US, 72 percent reported experiences of online toxicity in 2022, but this fell to 65 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>"It's the first positive shift that we saw [since research began in 2019]. It's actually reduced to 65 percent, which is a significant decrease," McBean explained.</p>
<p>"It's great, but we can't just assume everything's fine now. It's still two in three women."</p>
<p>Despite the fall in harassment, 20 percent of women gamers who responded to the survey said they simply choose not to play online due to potential harassment. One in 10 have been threatened with rape.</p>
<p>19-year-old French esports professional Mathilde conurred, saying: "Being a woman in gaming is "scary. You need to have confidence in yourself… if someone jumps on me, I will jump back."</p>
<p>Stephanie Ijoma says she founded the diversity and inclusion agency NNESAGA in order to dismantle "a system that was against us, and we are doing it".</p>
<p>"I'm a Black woman and Black women in this space are subject to more abuse than anyone else," Ijoma said.</p>
<p>Discord told Sky News it takes "immediate action" when harassment is reported, insisting "safety is integrated into every aspect" of its service, including "use a mix of proactive and reactive tools".</p>
<p><em><strong>If you have experienced this kind of abuse and are in need support, the </strong></em><a href="https://www.cybersmile.org/"><em><strong>Cybersmile Foundation</strong></em></a><em><strong> has dedicated tools, including a global support service, to help people deal with abuse in gaming. </strong></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the lackluster reception of the Minecraft movie trailer earlier this week, one animator has animated the entire trailer, and it’s so much better.</p>



<p>The animation is by 3D artist and animator <a href="https://x.com/Alumio_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Alumio_</a>, who has since seen his trailer animation go viral on X (formerly Twitter). At the time of writing, the tweet had been up for just five hours and had already received 140,000 likes, which matches the original trailer uploaded by Minecraft themselves. You can watch the animated Minecraft trailer below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What’s more impressive is that the animation only took Alumio a few days.</p>



<p>The Minecraft movie has a preliminary budget of $150 million and features the likes of Jason Momoa and Jack Black (who doesn’t look anything like Steve in the trailer, but just Jack Black with a blue shirt, but whatever).</p>



<p>The animated trailer seems to be connecting better with audiences, and although it’s unclear how successful the movie will be, it would be awesome to see a fully animated film in the future. The original Minecraft movie trailer uploaded to YouTube has already generated over one million dislikes, so it’s safe to say that fans of the game are not particularly happy about the movie’s direction.</p>



<p>Minecraft, the movie, is set to launch in theatres on April 4, 2025. </p>



<p>What do you think of the trailer animation? Do you think the movie will be a success? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The competition at the Fortnite Global Championship 2024 event has been absolutely insane, with some of the biggest names in Fortnite competing against each other under one roof in Texas. After gaining a 147-point lead yesterday, Peterbot and Pollo have officially dropped to second place.</p>



<p>Th0masHD and Queasy now take first place with a whopping 485 points, putting them well ahead of Peterbot and Pollo during Fortnite Globals.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-th0mashd-win-his-first-fncs">Will Th0masHD Win His First FNCS?</h2>



<p>Do not underestimate a duo like Th0masHD and Queasy. With both of the player’s crazy Fortnite history, these are two competitors you do not want to run into on the battlefield. Th0masHD, however, for how long he has been competing in Fortnite, has never had an FNCS win.</p>



<p>Now, being so far ahead of second place, this could actually be the day Th0masHD walks out a victor. But do not forget about Queasy, though, as the competitor, who used to duo with Veno, has been absolutely crushing the competition.</p>



<p>So, will today be history made for the duo?</p>



<h2 id="h-peterbot-and-pollo-throw-2-games-in-a-row-during-fortnite-globals">Peterbot And Pollo Throw 2 Games In A Row During Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>Starting the day off, both Pollo and Peterbot talked a big game, claiming they were the best duo in the world. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the two barely managed to grab any placement points during the first two games of today’s competition.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In fact, during game number eight of day two of Fortnite Globals, the team found themselves back in the lobby quite early, as the duo was pushed heavily in the storm earlier on. Sadly, after Peterbot accidentally closed off his downed teammate with a reinforced wall, the duo went down. </p>



<p>Still, with the 1.5x point-multiplier system coming into play today, we could see Peterbot and Pollo grab first place back for themselves.</p>

<p>Garvin said, "[Deacon] has been reduced to promoting other games", adding: "Well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!"</p>
<p>When someone in his comments suggested that he "calm down my brotha", Garvin said: "Haha, I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill [sic] promoting some small game and I'm being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking".</p> <div>

<p>We all already know Astro Bot has a lot of bots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-has-lots-of-bots-but-concept-arts-got-those-that-are-not">but what bots has Astro Bot not got</a>?</p>
<p>Eurogamer just awarded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot a sparkling five out of five stars</a>.</p>
<p>"When it's all done I'm left with that strange feeling of being very well cared for. I've seen a bunch of wild sights. I've messed around with cool gadgets, used the controller in unusual ways, tilting it, yes, but also blowing into it, trying to read the buried hieroglyphs of its rumble, I've ticked boxes, collected things, unlocked things, nodded at references that make me feel old, or sharp-eyed, or generally in the know," Donlan wrote.</p>
<p>"But when I close my eyes, I see the tumbling fruit, the hundreds and thousands, the gems stacked so high I can kick through them as if I'm wading through autumn leaves. I think, more than anything, of all the glorious bits and pieces."</p>
<p>Digital Foundry, meanwhile, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-astro-bot-is-virtually-flawless-a-ps5-masterpiece-and-a-gaming-celebration">Astro Bot a "virtually flawless and a joyous celebration of gaming"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> director Julian Gerighty has confirmed a patch is coming "maybe in 10 days" to address the game's "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">GamesRadar+</a>, Gerighty admitted that whilst the team had intentionally designed the sequence to build "tension", it "just [didn't] want it to feel unfair. And today, I think it feels unfair".</p>
<p>"This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days," he added.</p>

<p>"So especially, I mean, you're probably thinking of one of the early missions in Mirogana, which is incredibly punishing," Gerighty said.</p>
<p>"And for me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving.</p>
<p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low-hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p>
<p>Gerighty also confirmed that the team was on the lookout for other "blockers" that prevent players from "enjoying the game", revealing that Ubisoft will "tweak the narrative context" - such as, for example, adding additional PA announcements that better contextualise what's happening - "so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible". </p>
<p>"Star Wars Outlaws [...] feels like it's blagging it - much as Kay can, when regularly caught out by some far more worldly syndicate boss," We wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-outlaws-pushes-the-latest-pc-technologies-hard-and-the-results-are-stunning">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, in which we gave the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"The result is a series of quite painful comparisons: it lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
