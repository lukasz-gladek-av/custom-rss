            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/unknown-9-awakening-preview-body-swapping-twist-on-stealth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I think of Bandai Namco games, titles like <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> don't really come to mind first. They're like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/dark-pictures-anthology"><em>Dark Pictures Anthology</em></a> to me—known titles, but not immediately a "Bandai Namco game."</p>
<p>So I honestly didn't know what to expect with my preview of <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, but after spending an hour with my hands on the controller, I was pleasantly surprised with what Reflector Entertainment is trying to do.</p>
<p>Starring Anya Chalotra, who you might know as Yennefer from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/witcher-netflix-more-game-adaptations"><em>The Witcher</em> Netflix series</a>, this ambitious game is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-tells-first-of-many-spooky-stories">first step in a transmedia project</a>, involving comics, novels, and even a podcast series. But before we zoom out too far, is <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> a good first step?</p>

<h2>A Story Full of Secrets</h2>
<p>As the first step in this larger story, there's a lot of worldbuilding and terminology to wrap your head around. It's a universe that blends real-world history, mythology, and conspiracy to create a unique narrative.</p>
<p>From what I could tell, a primary part of the plot involves the Fold, a parallel world that exists alongside ours that holds powerful secrets that could change the world. Our protagonist, Haroona, is a Quaestor, a chosen one who can see into and manipulate the Fold.</p>
<p>There's a larger context here involving secret societies (as you'd expect for conspiracies), but needless to say, if you're the kind of person that likes getting lost in fiction, <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> is serving up a buffet.</p>

<p>In my hourlong demo, half of it was spent on the run in an Indian city in the late 19th century. A group called the Ascendants were looking for Haroona, and it created lots of opportunity for rooftop climbing, sneaky takedowns, and frantic chase scenes.</p>
<p>In the other half, I explored a jungle, which was crawling with enemy patrols still on the hunt for Haroona. Meanwhile, she was trying to find the location of some magic item, and an American gunslinger named Luther was trying to help her.</p>
<p>It reminded me a lot of games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/uncharted-4-thiefs-end"><em>Uncharted</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>—very narrative-driven, blockbuster-adjacent action.</p>

<h2>A Different Take on Stealth</h2>
<p>Where <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> really set itself apart for me was the stealth-combat sequences. Between light platforming with some banter, I found myself in little arenas with enemies scattered around.</p>
<p>Haroona's ability to interact with the Fold really manifest during the gameplay here. She can go invisible for a few seconds and set off traps (read: red barrels) from afar. There's also a detective-vision mode to see enemies through walls.</p>
<p>The most interesting mechanic, however, was her ability to take over enemy bodies. This lets you control an enemy, stop time, move them freely, and even queue up one of their attacks.</p>

<p>For example, if an enemy wasn't close enough to a red barrel, I could make them walk over and smack it, leading to their untimely demise and lots of confusion. If two enemies were near an environmental pitfall, suddenly I could turn that into three.</p>
<p>This isn't a hardcore stealth game though—if you're caught, a fight breaks out, and Haroona can decently defend herself. Open combat wasn't too difficult to get ahold of, with your typical light/heavy attacks and dodges.</p>
<p>Plus, you can use your body-swapping powers during combat, opening up your options even more. I saw in the upgrade tree that I could invest in multiple body swaps too, opening the door for all sorts of elaborate setups.</p>
<p>Unlike other games, when stealth doesn't work, I didn't feel like I had to reset. Consistently, I felt like I was making choices, sometimes out of practicality, other times out of vanity. <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> gives you lots of tools in these arenas, and it was up to me to find out how I wanted to express myself.</p>

<h2><em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> Has a Lot to Accomplish</h2>
<p>However, if the goal here is to start a larger franchise with novels and comics, <em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> (and its universe) will need more than exciting stealth combat.</p>
<p>All these fantastic factional fables about the Leap Year Society and the Ascendants are nice and all, but it's the character work that makes or breaks them for me. So far, my exposure to two major characters, Haroona and Luther, haven't moved me too much.</p>
<p>I found their banter to feel a little half-baked. Haroona's the stoic, focused one, while Luther is whimsical but definitely knows more than meets the eye. It didn't bother me, but it also didn't leave me wanting more from these characters. But to be fair, it might take more than an hourlong vertical slice to really let these characters marinate.</p>

<h2><em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Montreal-based Reflector Entertainment gave itself a tall order with its first game. It has to not only stand on its own legs, but also establish an entire transmedia franchise. While I'm hopeful the game will be a fun, serviceable adventure, it remains to be seen if I'll be hooked on some comics and novels.</p>
<p>But if I can keep forcing some schmucks to blow themselves up with red barrels, I'm pretty on board with seeing more of what the game has to offer. Luckily, it comes out soon on October 18 for PC and all consoles except the Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>The high price point of PlayStation's PS5 Pro has been a hot topic and EA's Vince Zampella has weighed in, offering a more middle of the road take on the console.

<p dir="ltr">"So I mean, it's a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it," Zampella said. "Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really."</p><p>As for what the PS5 Pro means for the next entry in the Battlefield series, Zampella said the team will need to wait and see. He continued on, saying that the overall adoption rate will affect what the team can do. In addition, since the next Battlefield will still have to run on the base PS5, the team will only be looking at what they can "plus up" for PS5 Pro owners.</p><p>EA hasn't announced when fans can expect the next Battlefield game, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro release</a> is just around the corner. While the $700 price has turned many away, anyone looking to play PS5 games at the best possible quality might still want to pick it up.</p>

            <p>
If (like me) you found developer Ironwood Studios' wonderfully weird four-wheeled survival game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> just a bit too exhausting when it launched earlier this year, now might be the time to go back: its new Drive Your Way update introduces a whole bunch of custom difficulty settings and presets to make things easier - or masochistically more difficult, if you prefer.
</p>
<p>
With Pacific Drive's new update installed, players can immediately <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/7176011919745442295">choose from seven presets</a> enabling them to tweak the difficulty of their adventures across the Olympic Exclusion Zone. These range from the standard Pacific Drive experience to Joyride - which retains the same fundamental core but reduces gathering, crafting, and research requirements - to presets that lean hard in the other direction. Nuclear Journey, for instance, smears everything in lethal radiation, while Iron Wagon doesn't just make things tougher, it deletes your save if you fail.
</p>
<p>
However, it doesn't end there; the Drive Your Way update also makes it possible for players to create their own presets, with over 50 considerably more granular settings available - complete with tweakable value sliders for each - as detailed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAMRq6zaE6g">video</a> below.

<p>
And given Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called Pacific Drive a "series of cruel brutalisations" and "horrible pain" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">four star review</a>, that extra help might be appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the update, custom music can now be played from local storage on PC, bumpers and wheels are now paintable, and there are two new collectible cosmetics - an antenna topper and mirror hanger - out in the exclusion zone. Additionally, Ironwood has released the paid Anomalous Cosmetic Pack DLC, containing the Mailbox Bunny bobblehead, Sawblade hood ornament, Tourist shifter, Anchor steering wheel, Vacation sticker pack, and Anomaly decal kit.
</p>
<p>
Previously, Ironwood <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drives-four-wheeled-survival-nightmare-gets-free-update-dlc-and-2024-roadmap">revealed</a> this latest release would be the second of three updates planned for 2024. Summer brought a photo mode, new car and garage content, plus free (and paid) cosmetics - and following Pacific Drive's new autumn update, another is due this "winter". As to what it might contain, that's currently unclear, with its content only listed as "redacted".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-fps-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent nearly the entire weekend playing <em>Wild Bastards</em>, a roguelike first-person shooter with some strategic elements sprinkled in. I had other things to do, and other things I had <em>meant </em>to do, like take my kids out, cut a tree down, wash my car, loads of stuff, but I did none of it, because I ended up playing <em>Wild Bastards </em>nearly the whole damn time.</p><p>If you played <em>Void Bastards</em>--the previous game from developers Blue Manchu, who by all accounts and despite their naming habits are lovely, and not bastards at all--you'll know a lot about what's up here. If not, just know that this is a bite-sized shooter where every shot you take is life-or-death. Large portions feel like <em>FTL </em>and smaller portions feel like Lucasarts' 1997 classic <em>Outlaws</em>.</p><p>Taking command of a gang of space cowboys, nearly all of whom are dead at the beginning of the game (and all of whom are cool as hell), your job is to scour the galaxy bringing each member back to life en route to reaching the fabled 'Homestead'. The crew chat between missions (and during them), have relationships you need to juggle and, most importantly, each have their own unique weapons and skills to bring to the shooting sections of the game.</p><p>Which you absolutely need to make note of, because <em>Wild Bastards</em> involves beaming teams of shooters down to the surface of planets and moving around a board game-like map, picking up perks, going shopping and fighting bad guys. When a fight is triggered, you jump from map view to FPS view, albeit very briefly; often you'll only have a handful of enemies to dispose of, and stages can last just seconds.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wild Bastards - Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Ay2BzDEUAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Which sounds quick and easy, and most of the time, it is! The catch is that you can only control two of your crew in a battle at a time. Remember how I said everyone has unique weapons and abilities? So do the dozens of different bad guys, so one space cowboy's weapon might be priceless in one fight and almost useless in the next.</p><p><em>Wild Bastards</em> hits every roguelike note it plays perfectly. You always feel in peril but never overwhelmed. There are always options available to you but you don't always get to use them. Sometimes you get to play as your favourite cowboy on your favourite type of stage and it's great! Other times people get hurt and tired, forcing you to use your least-favourite crew members, and you just need to make do.</p><p>What really makes it sing is the balance between all these disparate sections of the game. Normally I play these kinds of fragmented games in short bursts, a level or two then I'm out, but here one shootout blurred into another, the lure of fresh loot, cans of beans and new heroes to unlock keeping me going for hours at a time. The tension of the brief shootout levels--where damage can persist across whole planets--really does make them feel like...shootouts, where every shot counts and you've gotta be quick on the draw.</p><p>You know that joy you feel when a game you love is frictionless? When one idea blends into another, one system interlocks as perfectly with another as a Swiss watch, and you find yourself simply gliding through an entire video game? <em>Wild Bastards</em> made me feel that. I can talk about its parts all day, they're all good, but the real juice here is the sum of them.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/should-i-use-streamlabs-or-obs-for-streaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/should-i-use-streamlabs-or-obs-for-streaming.982653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/should-i-use-streamlabs-or-obs-for-streaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>One of the biggest questions when beginning your streaming journey is whether or not you should you Streamlabs OBS or regular OBS. Both basically do the same thing in the end, but there are still a lot of different aspects that you may want to take into mind before choosing which one to start with.</p>



<p>So, which streaming software should you use? Streamlabs OBS or OBS?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-which-streaming-software-should-you-use-streamlabs-or-obs">Which Streaming Software Should You use? Streamlabs or OBS?</h2>



<p>It can be daunting when trying to choose what streaming software works best for you. While Streamlabs and OBS are two of the most popular softwares out there, there are plenty of options too that may make the decision-making even more difficult.</p>



<p>Well, Insider Gaming is here to give you some insight into what streaming software you should be using.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It is highly recommended to start out using Streamlabs OBS when streaming on Twitch, Kick, YouTube and other platforms. In fact, once you start with Streamlabs, you will probably never want to stop using it. Here is why.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-reasons-why-streamlabs-is-better-than-obs">Reasons Why Streamlabs is Better than OBS</h2>



<p>There are quite a few reasons as to why Streamlabs OBS is better than regular OBS. Sure, OBS was the first software out there to allow people to stream on Twitch and other sites, but it is incredibly outdated. </p>



<h4 id="h-reasons-why-you-should-stream-on-streamlabs">Reasons Why You Should Stream on Streamlabs:</h4>



<ul>
<li>User-friendly</li>



<li>Multiple presets</li>



<li>Has a paid subscription</li>



<li>Multi-stream</li>
</ul>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-user-friendly">User-Friendly</h2>



<p>To start out, Streamlabs OBS is incredibly user-friendly. Regular OBS is meant more for those who know how to start from scratch. Streamlabs really feels like it walks streamers through its interface, making it an incredibly smooth process to use.</p>



<p>While many of the settings are the same on both softwares, Streamlabs makes it much easier to understand everything you are looking at. It is great for those who are new to the streaming world and still just as good for those who are veterans.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-multiple-presets">Multiple Presets</h2>



<p>The fact that Streamlabs OBS has various FREE presets for users to choose from is a big reason why the software is much better than OBS. With OBS, you either have to hire someone to create designs for you or do it yourself.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Teenage gaming streamer playing video game in his room</figcaption></figure>







<p>With Streamlabs, you can choose from multiple different presets, decorating the look of your stream and more. These presets include Starting Soon Screens, Notifications (sounds and more), Layouts and more.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paid-subscription">Paid Subscription</h2>



<p>While many of the presets are free, Streamlabs also has a paid subscription that gives you access to thousands of presets and more. The subscription also gives users free editing tools, clipping parts of your stream and turning them into viral videos for you to post on TikTok, YouTube and more.</p>



<p>While it may be $19.99 USD a month, the paid subscription is definitely worth it for those looking to really amp up their stream. You can also multi-stream when using the paid version of Streamlabs OBS, allowing you to stream to Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and other platforms at the same time.</p>



<p>Overall, Streamlabs OBS is the definite pick for being a better streaming software. Will you be using it?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting.982638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-confirms-next-battlefield-will-use-modern-setting/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just before EA's Investor Day, EA revealed new details on the upcoming untitled <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-entry-dev-team-biggest-ever-dragon-age-2024/">Battlefield game</a> with some new concept art. This concept art was revealed exclusively to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, and it was also confirmed that Battlefield will instead be coming to a modern setting after previous games took place in World War I and World War II.</p>
<p>At the moment, EA hasn't given too many specifics about where the game will take place and has declined to name what city it will take place in, but the concept art seems to suggest that it takes place somewhere in Europe. The game may be set somewhere like Italy or France, but right now, it's uncertain.</p>
<p>Looking at the concept art, it seems that ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will also be part of the new untitled Battlefield game, with natural disasters being a feature. The concept art shown off seems very similar to Battlefield 4 in terms of color scheme, an incredibly popular game.</p>
<p>This new game seems to be returning to basics for the upcoming Battlefield. In a discussion with Zampella, he spoke about his return to the modern era. "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there." In this conversation, it seems that Zampella has a lot of nostalgia for Battlefields 3 and 4 but also feels some love and nostalgia for 1942.</p>
<p>By returning to the modern setting, it seems as if they are trying to correct the course of the franchise after Battlefield 2042. This game wasn't particularly well revered at first but was eventually enjoyed by many. However, Battlefield 2042 was rather different and felt more like a hero shooter, especially with the 128-player maps that were incredibly ambitious and unpopular with fans.</p>
<p>The Battlefield developers have a lot planned but are currently keeping their plans under wraps. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in because that's the core of what we have to do—get the community back on our side, get that trust back."</p>
<p>Once Battlefield is released, it'll be a huge test of whether the community trusts them to do the right thing with this game or whether they feel it isn't as successful as previous games. With Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 being released soon, they have a lot of competition to go up against, and it'll be interesting to see what further details are released about the upcoming Battlefield game.</p>

        <p>"I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
EA has shared early first details for the next instalment in its Battlefield series, confirming the multiplayer shooter will be returning to the modern era for its next outing, and that the unpopular Specialists system has been jettisoned for good in favour of more traditional classes.
</p>
<p>
That's according to Respawn head and Battlefield boss Vince Zampella who, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">conversation with IGN</a>, teased a back-to-basics approach for the series' next outing following 2021's poorly received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. That starts with a return to the modern era, with Zampella explaining, "If you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-3">Battlefield 3</a>... <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a> era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there."
</p>
<p>
Beyond the setting, Zampella hints the still-unnamed next Battlefield may ditch 2042's sprawling 128-player maps in favour of more focused matches. "Did [128 players] make it more fun?," he posits. "Doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense. We're testing everything around what's the most fun... The maps, once they get to a certain scale, become different... So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields. I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces."

<p>
Unsurprisingly, given the system's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-overhauls-specialists-with-new-class-like-system">eventual removal</a> from Battlefield 2042, Specialists also won't be returning, with EA having this time opted for a more traditional class-based system. "It didn't work. It didn't fit," explains Zampella. "Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that".
</p>
<p>
Battlefield 2042's launch in 2021 was, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-2042s-disastrous-launch-what-next-for-battlefield">plagued with issues</a>, ranging from technical woes to questionable gameplay decisions, leading former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Martin Robison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-review-dices-magic-fps-formula-gets-spread-too-thin">call it</a> "the weakest Battlefield in some time". Players apparently agreed, and it didn't take long for Battlefield 2042 to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-is-now-one-of-steams-worst-reviewed-games-of-all-time">one of Steam's most negatively-reviewed games</a> of all time. The following February, 2042 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">officially declared a flop</a> as EA boss Andrew Wilson admitted it "did not meet expectations", and player numbers <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-2042-steam-concurrent-players-fall-below-1000-for-first-time">dwindled</a>, despite the publisher's best efforts to keep it afloat with sweeping changes to its core systems.

<p>
Zampella understandably hopes to avoid a similar fate for the next Battlefield, saying, "We want it to be good out of the gate." And to achieve that, there've been major changes to the series' development. Senior figures have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-creative-director-lars-gustavsson-leaving-dice-after-more-than-20-years">departed</a>, and EA has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-rethinking-battlefield-development-process-from-the-ground-up">rethought</a> development "from the ground up" - more recently saying it has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-amassing-largest-battlefield-team-in-franchise-history-to-double-down-on-live-service-multiplayer">now amassed</a> its "largest Battlefield team in franchise history", with EA Motive, DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect all pitching in.
</p>
<p>
Alongside today's teases, EA has released a single bit of concept art (above) to spark imaginations. And while there's currently no release date for the new Battlefield, it sounds like the publisher wants to get players in early. "We have a program that we're going to announce next year around getting more community in," Zampella explains, "because that's kind of the core of what we have to do — get the community back on our side, get that trust back. So I think we're in a really good place. Is it challenging? Of course, but it wouldn't be fun if it wasn't."

One big question the PS5 Pro is facing is what it'll mean for big games releasing in the latter part of the generation, including EA's untitled Battlefield game.</p><p>Asked for his thoughts on the new console, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization Vince Zampella took a wait and see stance on Sony's new console.</p><p>"I mean, we're not out yet, so does it really help us? Not right now. Can we do cooler things on it? Sure. I guess we'll see. As we see what the adoption is, we'll see how much it really affects us. We have to make a game that runs on everything, so it'll just be like, what can we plus up on something like that, pun intended," Zampella said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While comparatively little is known about the new Battlefield, it's apt to be kind of game that pushes the capabilities of the PS5 Pro. EA DICE has long used the Battlefield series as a technical showcase for the Frostbite Engine, pushing advanced effects, environmental destruction, and more. The initial concept art, which you can see below, hints at what fans might be able to expect from the new release.</p><p>As for the price, which has generated a considerable amount of discourse among fans and in the media, Zampella called it a "balance."</p><p>"I mean, I think it's expected and anything that gets us better performance for the people that really love it. To me, it's an amazing thing. I was watching something on it where the price... where they look at is it the most expensive. And it really isn't," he said. "If you go back, some of the older consoles were just as expensive and probably adjusted for inflation were probably more. So it at first seemed a little shocking, but it's kind of like, it's actually not that bad. And if you get a $700 PC, you're not getting the same performance that you're getting out of it."</p><p>He continued, "So I mean, it's a balance. Is it expensive for people? Absolutely. Not everybody will be able to afford it. Would it be better if it was cheaper? Sure. I want more people to have it. But it makes sense, really."</p><p>The PS5 Pro has been debated heavily since being revealed last week, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock">fans</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-at-700-lack-of-competition-made-it-an-easier-decision-for-sony-to-run-with-a-higher-price">analysts</a>, and Game Awards founder <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1833893956582617293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Geoff Keighley</a> all weighing in. An unscientific poll conducted by IGN showed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/polls-ps5-pro-price-reveal">only about 10 percent of respondents</a> were planning to pick up the mid-gen refresh, with most considering it too expensive. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/13/bf-ca-1726271105698.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The new Battlefield is apt to be the kind of technical showcase that pushes the PS5 Pro's capabilities.

There will always be a place for people like that — myself included — but it’s hard to see if we’re a big enough audience to justify making and selling a $700 PS5 Pro four years after buying a PS5 during a console generation that hasn’t really found its footing yet."</p><p>One way or another, the PS5 Pro will be out on November 7, and you can find our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">list of enhanced games right here</a>.</p><p>As for Zampella, he talked to IGN about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">the future of Battlefield in an exclusive interview</a> in which he also confirmed that it will return to a modern setting.

<p>Diablo 4 was a massive success for Blizzard, but now there’s an idea of just how successful the game is.</p>



<p>According to the LinkedIn profile of senior product manager Harrison Froeschke (h/t <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/blizzard-reveals-how-much-money-players-spent-on-microtransaction/z1726b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamepressure </a>for the keen eye), Diablo 4 has made the company over $1 billion in revenue since launch.</p>



<p>As part of his job description, Froeschke said that he “executed every step of game sales since game pre-order to the first expansion by configuring and collaborating with other teams resulting in over $1B total lifetime revenue.”</p>



<p>He then added that the game has made over $150 million in microtransactions alone. And it should be expected that the revenue number should go even higher with the launch of Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred in October.</p>



<p>It’s worth nothing that Froeschke’s profile has since been taken down. Microsoft nor Activision Blizzard also have yet to release any full official revenue information for Diablo 4</p>



<p>What do you think of the sales success of Diablo 4? Join the conversation in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield: Shattered Space - Official Deep Dive Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We love Starfield's massive open galaxy, but from early on in our planning, we knew we wanted to introduce some more secluded and handcrafted locations similar to what you've seen from our past expansions," said lead producer Joe Mueller. "There's so much mystery to House Va'Ruun! And becaused they've so thoroughly isolated themselves, it made them the perfect faction to explore in a completely self-contained experience."</p><p dir="ltr">"From the minute you arrive on Va'ruun'kai, the story never sends you off-planet," lead creative producer Tim Lamb explained. "You're free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va'ruun homeworld."</p><p dir="ltr">"Everything you discover, every location you visit, every side mission you seek out, it all tells the story of what happened here, and how the Va'ruun people have survived cut off from the comforts of the Settled Systems and the rest of humanity," Mueller added.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367736-screenshot2024-09-16at2.55.43%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4367736" data-ratio="0.54722222222222" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367736-screenshot2024-09-16at2.55.43%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4367736"></a><figcaption>House Va'ruun worships an entity known as The Great Serpent.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367736-screenshot2024-09-16at2.55.43%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Shattered Space, players will arrive on Va'ruun'kai shortly after a major disaster that sees the reclusive civilization descending into chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of our main themes throughout the base game is humanity's search for knowledge," lead quest designer Brian Chapin said. "Shattered Space is still about that search, but it's also about what happens when it goes too far. "Before the start of Shattered Space, a secret experiment involving Grave-Drive technology went terribly wrong. It's a very extreme pursuit, and it has backfired horribly for the people of House Va'ruun."</p><p dir="ltr">"[The experiment] resulted in a massive tear in the fabric of space-time that swallowed a significant portion of the Va'ruun capitol of Dazra," design director and writer Emil Pagliarulo said of the expansion's storyline. "You arrive just a few weeks after the Vortex Incident. It's still very fresh in everyone's mind. There's a massive crater in their city, nothing has been reconstructed, people are still searching for missing loved ones."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the massive crater, the people of Va'ruun are also dealing with other challenges. After the Grav-Drive experiment went sideways, The Scaled Citadel--House Va'ruun's seat of governmental power--became trapped within a mysterious energy field. Additionally, Anasko Va'ruun--Speaker for the Great Serpent and leader of House Va'ruun--is missing. His disappearance has created a power vacuum, and the smaller factions that make up House Var'uun are each fighting for control of the now-devastated Va'ruun homeworld, its government, and its future. As they progress through the story and explore Va'ruun'kai, players will have to interact with House Va'ruun's various sub-factions, and the trailer hints that the fate and future of House Va'ruun and its homeworld rest in the player's hands.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367737-shatteredspace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367737" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367737-shatteredspace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367737"></a><figcaption>House Va'ruun's homeworld, Va'ruun'kai, is extremely colorful and visually striking.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367737-shatteredspace.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Va'ruun'kai and Dazra City are like no other location in the base game," art director Istvan Pely said of Shattered Space's environments, which are visually striking and--unlike many other locations in the chronically desaturated Settled Systems--filled with color.</p><p dir="ltr">"Va'ruun'kai has a completely distinct visual identity," creative lead Alan Nanes added. "We say it's very 'alien.' You'll see this in the extraterrestrial landscape, gravity anomalies, and much more."</p><p dir="ltr">By "gravity anomalies," Nanes seems to mean "moments where gravity stops working," as the trailer features multiple shots of floating corpses and clips of low-g combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Due to the tear in the space-time continuum, strange creatures "from the other side" are slipping through the tear into Va'ruun'kai, and players will have to adapt accordingly. Bethesda says it wanted to use Shattered Space as an opportunity to "amp up" combat and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-adds-over-50-locations-and-new-enemies-called-horrors/1100-6526331/">introduce over 50 new creatures</a> (including an alien species simply referred to as "Horrors").</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367738-creatures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367738" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367738-creatures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367738"></a><figcaption>Players will have some horrifying new creatures to hunt when Shattered Space launches on September 30.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4367738-creatures.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Some creatures can set up ambushes, and the trailer features an extended clip of the player-character taking on a hive of very <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-may-update-causes-head-scratching-new-problems/1100-6523649/">Xenomorph-like</a> creatures called Cavern Bonecrests. The Cavern Bonecrest Queen appears to pose a significant threat, especially if players are unprepared. But the planet also has its fair share of standard Spacers, Va'ruun Zealots, and Crimson Fleet pirates for players to take on in their quest to uncover the truth behind House Va'ruun's downfall, restore order to its bickering factions, and decide its future.</p><p dir="ltr">Starfield's Shattered Space expansion launches on September 30 and will be available to purchase for $30 USD. However, players who purchased the $100 Premium Edition of Starfield will get the expansion for free on launch day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DON'T NOD may be done with the Life is Strange series, but they are most definitely not done with the narrative genre they helped shape with their games, as the Montreal studio is hard at work on Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, a game that promises to turn up to eleven everything seen in the developer's previous games with multiple main characters, two different timelines, and a mystery story that feels gripping right from the start.</p><p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to talk with Creative Director Michel Koch, Executive Producer Luc Baghadoust, and Producer Cathy Vincelli, discussing the game's 90s setting, its main influences, the multiple timelines, and what the future may hold for the universe. Enjoy.</p><p><em>The interview was edited for clarity and brevity.</em></p><div>
<p><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage features two different timelines and a mysterious event that separates the four friends. All of these, I feel, are very reminiscent of Stephen King's It, but was there anything else that influenced the setting?</strong></p>
<p>Michel Koch: There are a lot of things that haven't been a direct, heavy influence on the game. As you mentioned, we got some inspiration from It with the different timelines, but we do not have a murderous clown in the game. Other Stephen King's books have influenced the game, as did some TV Shows, like Twin Peaks, with the way they use these supernatural elements as something that is around the show rather than in every episode. We really love the use of mystic and supernatural elements to strengthen the story and bring more chaos and higher stakes to what's happening to the characters. Other TV Shows that had an influence are Big Little Lies and Sharp Objects. The latter is another show that blends different timelines well. Other games like Oxenfree and Nights in the Wood were also an influence with their group dynamics.</p>
<p>Cathy Vincelli: In terms of the two timelines, Twin Peaks is my main inspiration, and Yellow Jacket is another.</p>
<p>Luc Baghadoust: Like Michel said, there's no direct inspiration. We want to do things our way, and it's really all the culture, movies, and music that inspired and influenced us in some way or another.</p>
<p>Michel Koch: We also watched a lot of movies from the 90s just to get the vibe, like E.T. or The Goonies. Although the characters in the game are older than the kids in these movies, we still love the group dynamics of these movies, which show a group of kids bonding together.</p>
<p><strong>So, we can say that Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is a coming-of-age story?</strong></p>
<p>Michel Koch: It totally is. It is something we did in most of our games, and we love this type of story. Teenagehood is the transition from childhood to adulthood, a perfect moment of life where everything you make is forging who you will become as an adult, and this is something we like to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, as opposed to the Life is Strange series, is all about group dynamics. How difficult was it to create these dynamics, and what did it bring over your previous games?</strong></p>
<p>Cathy Vincelli: I wouldn't say it was difficult. For us, every main character is important, and we have tried to develop each of their personalities so that the group dynamics can make the player understand the essence of each character. The group dynamics also helped us make the game more diverse, as each character has a distinct design, and there are more points of view and more interesting dialogue options.</p>
<p>Michel Koch: It was very important for us to make the group work as one strong entity, but also to make sure that each girl was properly developed. Swan is the main character in Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, but the others have been developed the same way as if they could still be the main playable character in their own game if we wanted to. Even when you're not seeing them on screen, you still know what they did off-screen thanks to a timeline feature, which made sense to have in the game for us as the adventure takes place over one summer in the past, and we won't see every day of this summer. With the timeline, these off-screen events can still be talked about in dialogues, giving a feeling of realism to the whole experience.</p>
<p><strong>As you mentioned, Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage features multiple timelines. How do they alternate? Are there gameplay differences between them?</strong></p>
<p>Michel Koch: The timelines alternate as the storytelling dictates. At the beginning of the game, you play as Swann in the present, a 45-year-old woman who heads to the bar where the reunion with her friends takes place. As she meets these women she has forgotten, she starts reconnecting with them, and, as this happens, there will be dialogue options that will make the player jump to the other timelines. As such, there's really no systemic way to jump from one timeline to another. It's driven by the discussion between these friends who are reconnecting after having forgotten about each other for the past 23 years. It's a realistic way of doing something like this. Like going someplace with a friend you haven't seen in a long time and remembering things that were forgotten. As for the gameplay differences, the present timeline is played in first-person view, while the past timeline is in third-person. In the present, Swan is coming back as a single individual who's no longer part of a group, and we wanted the gameplay to reflect this difference.</p>
<p><strong>In the preview build, there are plenty of greyed-out dialogue choices that only become available after some exploration. How important are those, and how much is missed with limited exploration?</strong></p>
<p>Michel Koch: There's a lot in the game that can be missed, with the dialogue system and with the camcorder, because we wanted the experience to be more dynamic than in our previous games. We wanted the players to look around, to find new things, and to talk about the objects they found. At the same time, it's perfectly fine not to unlock these options, although you will be interacting less with the group. We put these in to place the player in the shoes of someone who is trying to fit in with a group of friends, so it's up to the player to not say much, stay a bit in the back, or be part of the discussion.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the camcorder. How did the idea come about? How does editing the footage impact the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Cathy Vincelli: The camcorder is both a narrative tool and a gameplay mechanic. It's Swan's way of interacting with the world around her. She is an introvert, so she is using the camcorder to bridge the gap between herself and the world. During the game, there will be objectives directly tied to filming specific things, but there are also collectibles that can be discovered using it. It also ties into dialogue options, as some objects cannot be seen without a camcorder.</p>
<p>Michel Koch: Editing footage is mostly for fun. We think players will enjoy it because it allows them to express their creativity. We hope that they will share their edited footage online with others.</p>
<p>Luc Baghadoust: We're really happy with the feature, as it adds something to the experience without forcing players to do anything. Whatever the player decides to do while shooting a sequence, it's still satisfying to see the exact shot that was taken when a memoir has been completed.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned collectibles. How many of them are there in the game?</strong></p>
<p>Cathy Vincelli: I can't give you an exact number, but there will be quite a bit. As for the rewards, they will offer some more insight into Swan, as sometimes, you will unlock a voiceover from Swan narrating how she filmed a certain object. The collectibles are also linked to trophies and achievements, but we feel the additional insight on Swann will be a very good reward, even for those who aren't into collecting trophies and achievements.</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is being released as two separate episodes, and the gap between them is rather short. Why?</p>
<p>Luc Baghadoust: We know there are a lot of people who don't like episodic games, but we like this distribution model because we like seeing players discuss and theorize about an episode while waiting for the other to release. The small gap between the two episodes allows this sort of online discussion without alienating those who would prefer playing the complete experience.<br>
I think the gap between the two episodes also hits a sweet spot.</p>
<p><strong>What's next for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage? DLC expansions? New games?</strong></p>
<p>Michel Koch: We are thinking about a lot of things. Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is an IP we own at DON'T NOD, and we have the luxury, as creators, to also start thinking outside the box about what we can do with this universe and with these characters. Stephen King, as we said, is a big inspiration, and I love the way he links all his books together. They can be part of something bigger, but they are also standalone stories. So we are thinking about world-building in this sense, and we already have ideas about how to continue the story, but as for what we will tackle first, we can't say for the time being. Depending on the reception of a specific character, or the setting, we will decide where we want to go.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>

		<p>I'm so happy we're not recording an episode of Sports!, because I just...it's the same as it ever was, man. Hope, pain, repeat. So: we're trying to show patience for a young team with a young quarterback. And while there's every reason to believe it's going to result in the same outcome that's been part of the Chicago Bears since I was old enough to care, there's probably not much to be mined out of Rob and I getting frustrated into a microphone too early. So...Sports! will come back soon enough, but given how much of the first month of the NFL season <em>feels</em> like pre-season, you'll hear from us in the next few weeks.</p><p>-pk, who was so sad about last night's football game he turned off <em>Retro Bowl,</em> too, which probably says a lot about my emotional state</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> I cannot wait to get a flood of message from people having <em>very strong opinions</em> about local permit ordinances. I just didn't expect that our way into that conversation on HOA would be about pigeons, of all things. FWIW, Monday is also usually when Rob and I start sketching out the next letter series, though as of this writing, we haven't landed on what we're going to talk about.</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We're recording an early episode of Remap Radio because of my former colleague, Jason Schreier, having a new book to promote and a Jets season to talk about. Oh, and because I had so much fun peppering Rob about Warhammer lore questions last week, we're going to dive back into <em>Space Marine 2 </em>for at another mission.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>The next spin of the ol' My Turn wheel is a documentary about the Francis Ford Coppola movie <em>Apocalypse Now</em>, titled <em>Hearts of Darkness.</em> I'm in the middle of watching it now. It's <em>great</em>. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdThqHvDA1mZZitu9DAb33xsWh-ji76_3AD2uhxmkidIrRgug/viewform?entry.547229530=test&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">You can send questions for that recording here.</a></li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>We'll, once again, spin the ol' wheel of GeForce NOW. We don't know what new games are being added to the service until right before the stream, so it's unclear what we'll play, but the nice part is there's so many random games on the service that the wheel is destined to provide value.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Besides another letter series between Rob and I, Remap Radio will hit podcast feeds, and if we're lucky, either Brad or I will manage to see credits on <em>Volgarr the Viking.</em> It feels like we're in the endgame, but who knows? That game is hard as hell.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>VR games developer nDreams has announced sweeping layoffs at the studio.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ndreams_today-all-of-our-ndreams-colleagues-were-activity-7241476493497835521-7hKo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> on Monday, the studio behind games like Powerwash Simulator VR, Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, and more announced that it was letting go of up to 17.5% of its staff.</p>



<p>“Having explored multiple alternatives to avoid such action over many months in a challenging VR games market, situated within a tough gaming landscape more broadly, it’s with deep regret that we are looking at losing valued and talented members of our teams,” the post said. </p>



<p>This round of layoffs, the company said, could impact all areas of the company, including senior leadership.</p>



<p>“Having been fully-focused on VR development since 2013, we have inevitably faced many challenges in building a modest independent studio into a world-leading VR game developer working to push both the technology and the market forward,” the statement  continued. “These necessary considerations of losing valued team members are the most difficult yet, but our belief in XR gaming is undimmed. </p>



<p>“We firmly believe that our proposed new structure will enable us to better serve current and future audiences in creating medium-defining titles for years to come. Upcoming games FRENZIES and VENDETTA FOREVER are unaffected and we can’t wait for everyone to play them soon.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out about the exact number of people who will be out of work from the layoffs. Thus far, no response has been received.  As of September 16, the games industry has seen nearly <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">13,000 people lose their jobs</a> at over 135 companies.</p>

<p>Astro Bot’s release on the PlayStation 5 (PS5) is off to a good start. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l4boixakzw2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Circana’s Mat Piscatella touched on the game’s launch on September 6. According to Circana’s data, Astro Bot was the second-best selling game on PS5 in the United States for the week ending September 7. The only game it was behind in sales on the platform was NBA 2K25, which released in early access on September 4 before a worldwide release on September 6.</p>







<p>On top of the game having a “solid” first week, it was also revealed that the custom Astro Bot DualSense controller was the best-selling accessory for the week.</p>



<p>As of writing, no official sales numbers have been released for Astro Bot. The game is available now exclusively for PS5.</p>



<p>What do you think of Astro Bot’s early sales success? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Insider Gaming Forums.</a></p>

                <p>Electronic Arts has revealed new details on the next Battlefield game, confirming a modern-day setting and revealing the game will ditch features from Battlefield 2042 that divided fans.</p><p>Whereas recent Battlefield games took place in World War I, World War II, and the future, the new Battlefield game takes place in modern times, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella?utm_source=twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA revealed in an IGN report</a>. The first piece of concept art (see below) depicts what appears to be a European city, spanning both land and sea, with a fire ripping through a nearby forest. The scene looks very chaotic in the traditional Battlefield sense.</p><p>Additionally, the new Battlefield game will say goodbye to features from Battlefield 2042 that fans quickly and loudly said they did not like. Battlefield 2042 launched with maps that supported up to 128 players, and this was a new level of scale the Battlefield series had never seen. But fans didn't like it, as matches could feel empty, and the developers eventually reverted back to 64-player matches. The next Battlefield will settle on a number that is "more akin" to what past Battlefield games offered.</p><p>"Yeah, the 128-player, did it make it more fun? Like...doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense," Battlefield boss Vince Zampella said. "We're testing everything around what's the most fun. We are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields. I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces. Some of them are really good. I can't wait for you to see some of them."</p><p>Battlefield fans also voiced their displeasure with Battlefield 2042's "Specialist" characters, which replaced the traditional Class system. Zampella, who didn't come to EA until this decision was already made, applauded DICE for trying something new. But he stressed that Specialists--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-update-3-2-brings-back-the-class-system-and-changes-the-default-controller-layout/1100-6511012/" data-ref-id="1100-6511012">which were later dumped from Battlefield 2042 in a post-release update</a>--won't come back.</p><p>"I wasn't there for 2042. I don't know what the rationale was, but for me, it's like the team tried something new," he said. "You have to applaud that effort. Not everybody liked it, but you got to try things. It didn't work. It didn't fit. Specialist will not be coming back. So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that."</p><p>Also in the interview, Zampella stressed that while Call of Duty is a competitor to Battlefield, he sees both franchises as offering something distinct to their fanbases.</p><p>"We're not looking to take down Call of Duty. We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us," he said, acknowledging that this new Battlefield game "has the possibility" to outsell Call of Duty.</p><p>It's still relatively early days, and there is no word yet on when the new Battlefield game will be released, though a report said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-will-have-a-free-to-play-battle-royale-report/1100-6521440/" data-ref-id="1100-6521440">might be here as soon as October 2025.</a> Intriguingly, Zampella said EA is going to announce a testing program for the next Battlefield game in 2025 to invite more fans to try the game before launch.</p><p>"That's kind of the core of what we have to do--get the community back on our side, get that trust back," he said. Whether or not this is some kind of open or closed beta, or a different type of test, remains to be seen.</p><p>Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <p>
With the first anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2's disastrous launch approaching, publisher Paradox Interactive has announced further delays to the game's DLC as developer Colossal Order focuses its efforts on completing the "crucial" assets editor.
</p>
<p>
Colossal Order <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dev-wont-release-paid-dlc-until-performance-fixed-to-our-standards">initially delayed Cities: Skylines 2's DLC</a> last November, amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">significant criticism of the game's performance</a>. As a result, its Beach Properties Asset Pack was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-studio-delays-expansion-pass-content-to-continue-fixing-main-game">moved</a> from its original 2023 release date to Q1 2024, while the Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs, and Bridges &amp; Ports expansion shifted from Q1 2024 to Q2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Beach Properties' eventual arrival was slammed by players for its high price and lacklustre content. As a result, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">issued an apology for its "rushed" release</a>, refunded players, and postponed work on all future paid DLC "indefinitely" while it continued to improve the game, shunting the Bridges &amp; Ports expansion all the way into 2025.

<p>
Since then, Colossal Order has made improvements to Cities: Skylines 2's economy, introduced decor tools, and launched <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-mods-finally-arrive-soon">initial mod support</a>. However, it's also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">indefinitely delayed</a> the game's console release - which was originally due last October - and it's now announced still further delays for its DLC.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/7373044403862069994?l=english">post shared on Steam</a>, Colossal Order explained it's currently prioritising the completion of Cities: Skylines 2's asset editor - what it calls "one of the most crucial remaining features" for modding - admitting it has "presented us with more challenges than we expected". The studio says "more work is needed" before it can set a timeline for the editor's release, and so - in order to avoid splitting its focus - all DLC has been nudged back once more.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs will now launch in Q4 this year, while the Bridges &amp; Ports Expansion has slipped into Q2 2025. "We will continue dedicating our efforts to the base game before shifting focus to paid content," Colossal Order added. "Our goal is to ensure the community is satisfied with the state of the game, and once we've achieved that, we'll be excited to release these amazing packs to you."
</p>
<p>
The studio has also highlighted a number of additional key areas it'll be focussing on as development continues, including "adjustments" for hotels and tourism, an expansion of the decor features introduced in the recent Detailer’s Patch, further economy tweaks, and more bug fixes. "We are committed to making Cities: Skylines 2 the best game it can possibly be," it concluded, "and we'll keep working until we get there."
</p>
<p>
News of further delays to Cities: Skyles 2's DLC follows setbacks for a significant number of other new Paradox Interactive projects over the last few months. Prison Architect 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">delayed indefinitely</a> back in August, while Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines 2 saw its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-continues-paradoxs-delay-streak-now-launching-next-year">moved out of this year</a> and into the "first half of 2025". Sims-like Life By You also suffered repeated delays but Paradox made the shock decision to pull the plug completely back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">shutting down its developer</a> - Paradox Tectonic - in the process.

            <title><![CDATA[Suda51 Says “Everybody Cares Too Much About Metacritic”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/suda51-says-everybody-cares-too-much-about-metacritic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suda51-says-%E2%80%9Ceverybody-cares-too-much-about-metacritic%E2%80%9D.982500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/suda51-says-everybody-cares-too-much-about-metacritic/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Goichi Suda, also known by his pseudonym Suda51, is the creator of games such as No More Heroes and Lollipop Chainsaw. He is considered a bit of an icon in the games industry and recently spoke about his opinion of Metacritic and how it is affecting the industry.</p>
<p>Suda51 and Shinji Mikami discussed Metacritic in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. They discussed their experience as video game developers and how Metacritic has affected them. "Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores." It isn't surprising that a developer like Suda51 has this opinion, especially when his games are very good at showcasing his sense of humor and personal touch. Despite receiving mixed reviews, he is well known for creating bizarre games that become cult classics.</p>
<p>Compared to other developers in the games industry, Suda51 clearly creates games for himself and what he likes. Most recently, Lollipop Chainsaw was remastered and re-released across platforms. So far, it has received positive reviews and commentary from the audience. "It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula: if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game. If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic."</p>
<p>In particular, Suda51&nbsp;<span>blames AAA companies, stating that those companies don't want to deal with the prospect of a negative online reception because "everyone cares too much about the numbers." This statement feels especially true, as the&nbsp;Director behind Star Wars Outlaws openly spoke out about his disappointment in the Metacritic score</span>&nbsp;despite it not being an inherently bad score.</p>
<p>He has admitted that he learned the hard way about checking Metacritic scores and said that it made him feel bad when media outlets gave his game studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, a zero.</p>
<p>This sort of criticism isn't surprising, as Suda51 is a fan of parody characters and satire in his games. For example, Damon Riccitello is the main antagonist of Travis Strikes Again and No More Heroes III and is a very obvious parody of John Riccitello. This character was made as a nod to the frustrations felt while developing games such as Shadows of the Damned and the strain the company felt while Riccitello was CEO of Electronic Arts.</p>
<p>Metacritic isn't the be-all and end-all of game reviews. Still, many companies are certainly acting like it is, although they are more likely to get beneficial commentary from those who post reviews on Steam or discussion pages and forums dedicated to the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is a project in which many companies came together to create something special. As we've known for a while, the idea <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-great-circle-idea-for-the-indiana-jones-game-was-first-conceived-by-bethesdas-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came</a> from Bethesda Game Studios and Elder Scrolls/Fallout/Starfield franchise director Todd Howard, who then selected MachineGames to develop the game. Of course, since the franchise belongs to Lucasfilm, they had to be involved, too.</p>
<p>In an interview <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/news/craig-derrick-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on Lucasfilm.com, Lucasfilm Games Executive Producer Craig Derrick praised Howard's concept:</p>
<p><em>For an Indiana Jones adventure to truly shine, it needs a globe-trotting journey with a strong historical element—something grounded in reality yet wrapped in mystique or relevance. With The Great Circle, Todd Howard and the team at MachineGames struck gold by centering the story on a real-world mystery: a number of ancient sites around the world align on a perfect, unbroken circle, yet the reason behind this alignment has eluded people for centuries.</em></p>
<p><em>The more I learned, the more fascinated I became with the idea. We delved into what kind of MacGuffin could be linked to all these sites and how each location could be authentically represented within the context of Indy’s life. This process of exploration and discovery fueled the world-building of the game from the very beginning, ensuring that each aspect of the story was both true to the character and engaging for the player.</em></p>
<p>Later in the interview, Derrick named a specific inspiration for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: 1992's point-and-click adventure title Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p>
<p><em>From uncovering and investigating the central mystery of the story to tackling unique situations along the way and outsmarting traps designed to keep the world’s secrets hidden. We wanted the player’s primary focus to be on using their brains before their brawn, although punching bad guys is also a lot of fun. In many ways, we envisioned this game as a spiritual successor to Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and other classic adventure games. It’s about thinking, discovering, tracking down clues, and sometimes just a bit of luck to get through the various traps, tombs, and threats encountered—all while capturing that over-the-top Saturday matinee feel that defines an Indiana Jones adventure.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launches on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PS5 version has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development for Spring 2025. On PC, the game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-support-nvidia-dlss-3-5-and-full-ray-tracing-path-tracing-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> full-fledged path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 3.5.</p>

<p>Zynga, the developer behind games like Farmville, Words with Friends and more, has been ordered to pay IBM $45 million. The verdict comes from a patent infringement lawsuit filed by IBM in 2022.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/zgvonodbkpd/IBM%20ZYNGA%20TRIAL%20verdict.pdf">to the verdict</a> from a federal jury in Delaware, United States, it was determined that Zynga violated IBM’s patent rights on its “foundational” technology. The verdict states that Zynga violated two IBM patents. </p>



<p>The first patent, the “<a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadBasicPdf/7072849?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiJjN2Y5OTk2Zi1lNTMwLTRlNjMtYmNkNS1hYTAxZTMwNzk3ZTQiLCJ2ZXIiOiI4OGE0ZGEzOS02NzllLTQzZTgtYWE3OS00YzViMWI0ZjgwY2YiLCJleHAiOjB9">849 Patent</a>“, involves a  “method for presenting advertising in an interactive service provided on a computer network”. The other patent, the “719 Patent”, concerns a dual model-view-control development approach of an application.</p>



<p>For its defense, Zynga said that the the patents were invalid. The company is expected to appeal the decision. </p>



<p>Zynga was acquired by Take-Two Interactive in 2022 for $12.7 billion. Take-Two has yet to respond to requests for comment on the verdict.</p>
