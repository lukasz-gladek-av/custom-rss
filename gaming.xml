Also, it’s an ideal, ready-to-race package that will rev the engines of anybody who dreams less of shaving PBs on a track and more about shredding POS cars in Wreckfest 2.</p>That’s pretty much what I decided to throw my Moza R3 at. I took a lovely, metal-twisting holiday away from my usual MO of testing Direct Drive wheels with hypercars and perfect lines. Was that an unorthodox test bed? Kinda. But I maintain that the Wreckfest series is a low-barrier gateway racer that can create serious rally addicts eventually. <p data-cy="paragraph">Better than that, though, it’s just big gobs of fun with physics a-go-go and punchy force feedback aplenty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 3.9Nm thrumming in this wheelbase doesn’t exactly redline with its peak power, it’s still a solid and stylish DD unit that hums along like a finely tuned machine. Unlike its clunkier, noisier gear-and-belt-driven rivals at the entry level, the R3 is whisper-quiet and ridiculously compact in comparison. Better yet, the bundle is extremely mod-friendly, so upgrading your ride down the road is a cinch—no need to swap out the whole chassis.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Moza R3 PC Bundle – Photos</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 – Design and Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Moza R3 Racing Wheel and Pedals bundle is a full-throttle, plug-and-play racing system. Inside the box, you’ll find Moza’s new 3.9 Nm R3 wheelbase, a 280mm PC-compatible steering wheel, a set of SR-P Lite pedals, and a separate table clamp is also included. Believe you me, you’re going to need that last bit of kit once the FFB gets going. Nothing jerry-rigged or half-arsed is going to hold this sucker down when the cars start cartwheeling.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said clamp is made entirely of steel and is rigid as hell—quite sturdier than the plastic alternatives, and it has a generous 50mm of clamp space. Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money. Thanks to a beefy desk and a straightforward system of four mount holes to secure the R3 wheelbase, this setup holds up well under the stresses of force feedback. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Via the chaos of Wreckfest 2, I certainly gave that rigidity a run for its money.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Weighing in at just 2.29 kilos and measuring a compact 120mm high, 135mm wide, and only 93mm long (excluding the steering shaft), the R3 is a pocket rocket of a wheelbase. Its boxy, industrial design gives it a serious motorsport aesthetic—far more race-ready-looking than some of the older, plastic clamshells that are out there competing.</p><div catalogid="bc8e4b87-8511-42d5-b60f-ad814276dea7" id="218220"><div id="218220" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MOZA R3 Bundle for PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like that the ports on the back are neatly arranged for easy access, with slots for pedals, a dash display, a shifter, a handbrake, and even an emergency stop device. Out of the box, the only one you’ll need is the pedal port, but expansion is as easy as adding aftermarket mods to a project car. There are also two threaded holes up top for mounting Moza’s dash display.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wheel-wise, the one you’re getting default here is a comfy D-shape affair with a grippy polyurethane wrapping. I like the feel of the clicky, short-throw paddle shifters that are crafted from sturdy black metal. And I dig that Moza allows for some customisation here—the brushed metal wheel rim is removable, and alternative rims are available to better serve your race discipline of choice.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/06/screenshot-526-1743902518354.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Size comparison between the R3 (top) and R9 wheelbases.</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heading below the equator, we have the R3’s pedal set, which is only an accelerator and a brake. If you’re searching for a clutch experience—and that’d make perfect sense for OG muscle cars in Wreckfest 2—you can make an extra pit lane purchase of a third pedal. Prices seem to be reasonable for that, and I know from experience that Moza’s ecosystem is all about easy installation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond that, these metal pedals feel a heck of a lot more robust than some of the plastic-heavy alternatives on the market. Resistance comes from springs rather than a load cell, so while they’re not championship-grade, they should be more than enough for entry-level sim racers. There’s also a surprising degree of adjustability, with pedal pads that can be repositioned higher or lower, and the entire pedal units can be moved left or right.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Moza R3 x Wreckfest 2: Performance</h2><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>With 3.9 Nm of peak torque, the R3 isn’t exactly a torque monster, but it’s right in the slipstream of other entry-level contenders with similar price pricepoints. It’s also perfect for some low-stakes, throw-around fun in a physics-heavy (yet nonetheless arcade-y) title like Wreckfest 2.</p><p>I’m not going to lie to you, though; I did need to do some tinkering to make Wreckfest 2 speak correctly with the R3, at least initially. However, thanks to the ever-changing landscape of Early Access, a few hotfixes meant I no longer had to constantly rebind/reverse my pedals in Moza’s (usually quite capable) Pit House software. Everything works pretty much as it should now, and, obviously, support will only get better as yet more fixes roll out.</p></div><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/26/wreckfest-2-early-access-blog-1742971666798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pictured: things rolling out that will <em>definitely need fixes</em>.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>The R3’s FFB feels wonderful when you laterally thunk into other cars—typically when you’re using “dodgem cars” cornering logic to pinball past an apex while pinging some competitor off into a tree. Likewise, the feelings you get through the wheel when you’re on the receiving end of such tactics and are forced to shred through some random fence or tyre pile are nice and visceral.</p><p>Car-nage collisions aside, I’d also be remiss if I didn’t highlight how satisfying a stretch of clean racing can be—that basic yet intimate FFB conversation between balding tyres and terra firma. Obviously, with Wreckfest 2 having closer DNA to a rally experience than a staid, single-surface track racer, every lap can (literally) feel like a series of plot twists. You’d better believe your hands will notice the difference when you drift in and out of bitumen to gravel to mud and back again.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and it goes without saying that any time there’s a momentary lull in any and all force feedback followed by a wrist-rattling jolt, that is just…well, a chef’s kiss experience. I can furnish you with two memorable examples of this. One, whenever you get some sick Dukes of Hazzard air and land on something you shouldn't have. And two, reversing from a bad corner upset, flicking into neutral, and then getting utterly and unexpectedly blindsided by some AI trying to break the<em> land speedbump record through you</em>.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Incidentally, I would like to say that POV racing in Wreckfest 2 with a decent FFB wheel such as this is the rough racing equivalent of a mini horror game. With your peripherals increasingly blinkered by the cabin of a crumpling car, every race is basically a series of untelegraphed jump scares that reach out and grab you through this wheel. Obviously this “driving on eggshells” sensation becomes more pronounced when you’re engaged in an actual demolition derby event, and some bastard has just bent your bonnet up over 80% of your windscreen.</p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/04/wreckfest2earlyaccessreleasedatetrailer-ign-blogroll-1738679001752.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tis but a scratch. It'll buff right out.</figcaption></figure></output></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>I honestly shudder to think what those unexpected crashes will feel like for any gamer gripping a Moza R12 or higher. Those impacts you’ll get with 12 or 16 Nm worth of grunt will surely be the stuff of warning label justification. Hell, even a surprise bash through the 3.9 Nm force of the R3 delivers a respectable hand rattle. As unthinkable as it may sound, you may actually find yourself turning it down.</p><p>All that being said, multiplying the Moza R3 Bundle with the Early Access antics of Wreckfest 2 is one of the funnest things I’ve done all year thus far. Even as a proud owner of a Moza R12 wheelbase and pretty much every fancy add-on that comes with it, I was impressed by the performance and value proposition of this younger brother bundle. If you have budget aspirations of joining the simming scene—or you just wanna <em>feel</em> stuff crash harder than a stock market after tariffs—I say turn the key on an R3.</p></div><p> Adam Mathew is our Aussie deals wrangler.

            <p>
Right, anybody fancy a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> update? Well, it's not ready just yet, but developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/deep-field-games">Deep Field Games</a> did share a look at the game's upcoming Cold Fusion update that looks like it'll be a beefy one. As you can probably guess by the title of the update, there's a bit of a chill coming, specifically in a new area called the Residence Sector. This new locale has "something" going on that's making it a bit too cold for anyone to hang out in, though the mystery behind it is something you'll likely have to play to discover.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Then there's the new upgrade system that'll come with this update. Once you reach a certain tier you'll be able to build a new station that'll let you improve your weapons, armour, "and a few other item types", which sounds like it'll make certain instances in the game a little less stressful. It also seems like you'll be able to reset your character, and the room you do it in definitely doesn't look cold and unwelcoming.
</p>
<p>
One big thing that will be changing is base assaults, because as Deep Field Games put it, they "kinda stink." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/543352686106378315?l=english">Steam post</a> detailing the update explains that while portal storms are generally working as intended, there are "several cases, mostly non-Pest related assaults, where they will simply spawn inside your base or in the same spot over and over." As a result of this, some big changes have been made to how bases are detected, and Deep Field Games are hoping that assaults should feel "a lot more unique and varied."
</p>
<p>
On the smaller end of new additions in the update, and possibly my favourite of everything that's coming with it, is the fact that bins can be used as bins. Got something you don't want? Just chuck it in there! Gotta love it when a game has tiny little functions like this.
</p>
<p>
There's no word on when this update will arrive just yet, so we'll all just have to keep our eyes peeled in the meantime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/05/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-too-expensive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has spun the gaming world around this week, with excitement and joy mixed in with gasps of exasperation. Why the exasperation? Well, it’s partly because of the price. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is set to be the most expensive Nintendo hardware of all time, coming in at £395.99/$449.99/€469.99 for the console itself, or £429.99 / $449.99 /€509.99 for a bundle with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>Based on the reaction from certain parts of the internet and the wider world, it’s clear that people were hoping for it to be closer to the price of the original Switch, but there’s a variety of reasons why it’s not. In further bad news for price-sensitive gamers in the US, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-delayed-due-to-tariffs-but-release-still-set-for-june/">it might actually get worse</a>.</p>

<p>As a starting point, we need to talk about inflation. Inflation, rather than just being for balloons, is an economic effect wrapped up in the tracking of increases in average prices. They look at general goods – milk, bread, etc. – and see how much they were in the same month last year, with the percentage increase setting the inflation figure for that month. Inflation in the UK is 3% while it’s 2.8% in the US, so a pint of milk costs 3% more now than it did in April last year, and that impact is felt much stronger when compared over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>What drives inflation? This isn’t the place for an essay on economics, but increases to wages are the main driver, as this then affects every business and service, who then put their prices up to maintain their own growth and profits. So, in basic terms for milk’s case, the farm hands’ wages increase, the delivery drivers’ wages increase, the factory workers that package the milk wages increase, and then the workers in the shop that sell the milk wages increase. The result? The price of milk goes up.</p>

<p>This is a long way of saying that the price of things generally goes up. Electronics have often defied that upward trend over the past few decades, but the world-changing events of the last five years has put paid to that.&nbsp;On a baseline level, we shouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to cost the same price as the original Switch, which launched at £279.99/$299.99/€329.99 eight years ago – £280 in 2017 is now £367, when adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>On top of that, this is a wholly improved console. While we don’t know the specifics of the chipset or RAM yet, it’s clearly a much more powerful device, capable of running titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, along with the addition of a larger 7.9″ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, improved Joy-Con 2, 256GB storage, new microphone and chat functionality and an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">impressively useful mouse mode</a>. The Switch 2 is a natural and clear evolution of one of the most successful consoles of all time.</p>

<p>Alongside those technical improvements, the handheld landscape has changed in the past seven years, with the rise of Valve’s Steam Deck, and Windows portables like the ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. While we can’t be sure of the Switch 2’s hardware, it seems to be more proficient than the current Steam Deck model, which starts at £349 in the UK, with a lower resolution and plainer 60Hz LCD screen, and where you’d have to then buy a separate £69 dock for TV play, and some kind of controller on top of that.</p>
<p>Where the Steam Deck has the clear edge is on game pricing. Steam, and PC gaming in general, has always had lower software costs, and that’s emphasised here with Nintendo making bumping up the price of their top tier games to £66.99/€79.99 for digital versions of games like Mario Kart World, while physical copies are even more expensive again at £75. Nintendo are far from the only company to have increased prices in the last few years. £70 is now the baseline for an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed</a>, an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC</a>, a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty</a>, and Nintendo are loosely matching that, and Sony has been all-in on double-dipping with PS5 remasters with paid upgrades from PS4, which Nintendo is now following with their Switch 2 Editions.</p>
<p>Game prices languished in a £50-60 region for a long, long time, even if it often didn’t feel like that thanks to retailers like Amazon, supermarkets and others often chopping the price of games after a couple months or even a few weeks, and with deep cuts that we always eagerly await during sales. Even Game Pass and PlayStation Plus have changed the perceived value of games. We’ve been living in a golden age where you could likely afford, and gain access to, a heap of games to play – probably more than you physically have time for – but this might be another indication that it’s coming to an end.</p>
<p>By splitting the pricing, though, this is a clear push to get people to go digital. You can spin that as cutting out the cost of producing a physical cartridge, or note it as a shrewd way to disincentivise the second hand market.</p>
<p>All of this is made worse by the stagnation of wages, which, while increasing, haven’t kept in line with inflation. Fundamentally, you can afford less than you used to. Does it suck? Yes, and the increase of game pricing is a huge burden for people in this hobby, but those blaming Nintendo for all of this need to turn their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nintendo’s business model has always been not to lose money on their consoles and that’s clearly a policy that’s worked, when other manufacturers like Sega have fallen by the wayside. The increased price for the console and its games are nonetheless a bitter pill to swallow, especially when everything else in the world is also going up, from your weekly shopping to a pint down the pub.</p>
<p>US gamers will soon have to think about another thing on top of all that: tariffs. Donald Trump has gone to economic war with the rest of the world, placing or increasing tariffs on imports into North America. That’s caused such a huge wave in the global economy that Nintendo have postponed Switch 2 pre-orders in that territory. The genuine outcome could be that the Switch 2, and its physical games, cost even more than the announced price, and gamers are the ones who’ll likely end up out of pocket. This will affect PlayStation, Xbox and PC gamers just as much.</p>
<p>So, will I be getting a Switch 2? Yes. It feels like a natural competitor to the Steam Deck, and the pricing is in line with that. Nintendo also make amazing games that you can’t play elsewhere, and while I think the price of Mario Kart World is steep, the amount of playtime I’ll get out of it with my family and friends will still make it a sound investment. I totally understand anyone who isn’t going to make that jump quite yet. It hasn’t dimmed my excitement for a system that’s been talked and hypothesised about for a long time, but for some, it makes a Switch 2 a real luxury, and as a luxury it might not be as essential as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Will you be nabbing a Switch 2? Or do you think the prices too high?</p>

Unlike past commander deck overviews we've done like with Aetherdrift's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/aetherdrift-commander-living-energy-review-and-upgrades" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Aetherdrift Commander: Living Energy Review and Upgrades">Living Energy</a>, these are focused just on reviews, and not on upgrades as well.</p>

<h2>Jeskai Strikers Review</h2>

<p>The latest Spellslinger Commander preconstructed deck, Jeskai Strikers has plenty of potential power for <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Magic: The Gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> spellcasters everywhere.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=LyMbDa_D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jeskai-strikers-commanders.jpg?itok=uMPKy6QA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Its commander options are <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/7/shiko-and-narset-unified" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shiko and Narset, Unified">Shiko and Narset, Unified</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/2/elsha-threefold-master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Elsha, Threefold Mentor">Elsha, Threefold Mentor</a>, each of which wants the deck to go in somewhat different ways. Shiko and Narset want a mixture of cheap spells and larger payoffs that target to maximize the return from its ability, which doesn't require a focus on instants and sorceries unlike many cards like it. Meanwhile, Eisha wants lots of small spells and voltron type inclusions so that the number of tokens can be maximized, and then exploited by playing spells to pump them all.</p>

<p>There are two standouts in the new cards. Starting with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/40/will-of-the-jeskai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Jeskai">Will of the Jeskai</a> it is both a <a href="https://mtg.wiki/page/Wheel_effect" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Wheel Effect in Magic: The Gathering">wheel</a> and a <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mm3/105/past-in-flames" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Past in Flames">Past in Flames</a> effect for a lot of value in spellslinger and combo decks. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/16/tempest-technique" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tempest Technique">Tempest Technique</a> is the other allstar having the Storm Mechanic on it, and its pump getting exponentially larger as you get more of it on a creature.</p>

<p>While lacking the raw power of last year’s Quick Draw Jeskai Strikers hit most of the expected marks for a spellslinger deck. Its largest flaw is how it is pulled in a few directions, which can show up in hiccups in gameplay, but provides lines in how to improve it. Others may also regret that it doesn’t significantly innovate on the spellslinger archetype in any way.</p>

<h2>Mardu Surge Review</h2>

<p>The Mardu clan take center stage with Mardu Surge, an aggressive WBR deck capturing the relentless spirit of the spirit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=6o1LcKf1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mardu-surge-commanders.jpg?itok=79FPzpPp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/10/zurgo-stormrender" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zurgo Stormrender">Zurgo Stormrender</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/6/neriv-crackling-vanguard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Neriv, Crackling Vanguard">Neriv, Crackling Vanguard</a>, the deck features a pair of aggressive aristocrats commanders. Zurgo makes you a token each attack, and provides payoffs when you kill tokens in the form of cards, or damage. Meanwhile, Neriv comes with bodies, and provides card draw that rewards the range of different tokens in the deck. Both synergize well, and work together, for an aggressive, token heavy plan.</p>

<p>Among the new cards two stand out to me quite clearly. The first is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/11/ainok-strike-leader" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ainok Strike Leader">Ainok Strike Leader</a>, a bear who when it or your commander attack it creates a 1/1 goblin attacking each opponent. Beyond that 5 power attack force for 2 mana, it can also sacrifice to give your creature tokens indestructible for a turn, making it quite a powerful and flexible creature. The other one is this deck’s inclusion in the powerful Will cycle with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/17/will-of-the-mardu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Mardu">Will of the Mardu</a>. This one can serve almost as a pseudo-fog by giving you one creature for each an opponent of your choice has, while also being an army in a box. It pairs that with a burn for each creature you control to an opponent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mardu-surge-ainokstrike-leader-and-will-of-the-mardu.jpg?itok=5FNcTi_V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mardu-surge-ainokstrike-leader-and-will-of-the-mardu.jpg?itok=NVs8nDYM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>They are joined with a marquee reprint in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/118/grand-crescendo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Grand Cresendo">Grand Crescendo</a>. Previously only printed in Streets of New Capenna Commander, this instant protects your creatures, and creates an army. It’s joined by some other solid value cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/181/gix-yawgmoth-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor">Gix, Yawgmoth Praetor</a>, and a number of other cards in the $5-$9 range.</p>

<p>Mardu Surge is a powerful go-wide deck with a lot of strong cards, and synergy in it. While it can, of course, be improved, out of the box this deck is worth buying both from a value and playability standpoint.</p>

<h2>Sultai Arisen Review</h2>

<p>Rise from the grave, or at least otherwise interact with there is the plan for the Sultai Arisen preconstructed deck.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=E16-Nbzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-commanders.jpg?itok=dvrS0Mzo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sultai Arisen’s commanders are a tale of two stories in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/5/kotis-sibsig-champion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kotis, Sibsig Champion">Kotis, Sibsig Champion</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/8/teval-the-balanced-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval, The Balanced Scale">Teval, the Balanced Scale</a>. Kotis is not a particularly interesting commander, as it’s an ability we’ve seen before, and better. The escape-esq cost of exiling cards to escape is notable, and the growing isn’t enough to redeem it. On the other hand, Teval is fire, and should be moved right into the command zone. A solid 4/4 for 4 flying, it mills 3 on attack, getting you a land back, and anytime you grab something from your grave, you get a zombie token. There’s a lot of things to do with the dragon, and it’s no surprise he’s an early leader for one of the most popular commanders.</p>

<p>Sultai Arisen’s new cards are tied to graveyard mechanics as you would expect. To highlight two cards I call attention to <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/25/afterlife-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Afterlife from the Loam">Afterlife from the Loam</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/28/tevals-judgment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Teval's Judgment">Teval’s Judgment</a>. Afterlife from the Loam can cost only BBB (with Delve 5) and gets you the best creature from each player’s graveyard. While that’s a powerful reanimator spell, Teval’s Judgment is a strong value piece for decks that want to play out of their graveyard, giving mana, cards, and creatures for doing so.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=OmXIPajQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultai-arisen-afterlife-from-the-loam-and-tevals-judgment.jpg?itok=gOrdUe8M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are some solid reprints in the deck in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/192/ob-nixilis-the-fallen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ob Nixilis, The Fallen">Ob Nixilis, The Fallen</a> running over $15, and being a strong card. It’s joined by a series of $10ish reprints like the classic <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/96/life-from-the-loam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Life from the Loam">Life from the Loam</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/176/dauthi-voidwalker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dauthi Voidwalker">Dauthi Voidwalker</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/295/lord-of-extinction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lord of Extinction">Lord of Extinction</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/352/command-beacon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Command Beacon">Command Beacon</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/354/crypt-of-agadeem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Crypt of Agadeem ">Crypt of Agadeem </a>to give the deck a solid monetary value.</p>

<p>Overall Sultai Arisen brings a new marquee commander option in Teval, Balanced Scale, and provides a lot of useful cards for graveyard based decks in Sultai colors. It plays a bit lumpy, and its curve needs some smoothing, but there’s no denying the power here.</p>

<h2>Abzan Armor Review</h2>

<p>The tough Abzan come to play with a deck that’s all about toughness and making use of that toughness.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=MNvSdvy6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-commanders.jpg?itok=DBcPrFUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Commander options here are very split with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/4/felothar-the-steadfast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Felothar the Steadfast">Felothar the Steadfast</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/1/betor-ancestors-voice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Betor, Ancestor’s Voice">Betor, Ancestor’s Voice</a>. Felothar the Steadfast is a new toughness matters commander who allows defenders to attack, and will compete for one of the top spots in that archetype with Arcades, the Strategist due to it also having an explosive card draw ability. Betor, Ancestor’s Voice isn’t really fit to lead the deck - while an interesting commander, the deck lacks the life gain and loss support that it really needs to work.</p>

<p>Abzan’s new cards are weaker overall than many of the others I feel. That’s not to say though that you shouldn’t be interested in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/31/will-of-the-abzan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Will of the Abzan">Will of the Abzan </a>as a strictly better <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/187/zombify" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zombify">Zombify</a> with upside, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/27/jaws-of-defeat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jaws of Defeat">Jaws of Defeat</a> will become an archetype staple for toughness matters decks. The new cards here are pretty narrow though.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=4RMdpi2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abzan-armor-will-of-the-abzan-and-jaws-of-defeat.jpg?itok=v6UITLip 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Reprint wise the deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/286/dragonlord-dromoka" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonlord Dromoka">Dragonlord Dromoka</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/268/seedborn-muse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Seedborn Muse">Seedborn Muse</a>, with the former often around $15, and the latter a green staple typically over $10. Other than those though, reprints here are very narrow like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/336/weathered-sentinels" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Weathered Sentinels">Weathered Sentinels</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/121/indomitable-ancients" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Indomitable Ancients">Indomitable Ancients</a>, or often not particularly desirable like the inevitable <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/142/zetalpa-primal-dawn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zetalpha, Primal Dawn">Zetalpha, Primal Dawn</a> printing.</p>

<p>I like some of what is going on in Abzan Armor, but the attempt to graft in a life-loss/life-gain theme with Betor and some of the cards interferes with the deck. It’s also light on card draw, relying on Felothar to carry that, making it fragile if it needs to restock.</p>

<h2>Temur Roar Review</h2>

<p>RAWR! Dragons Go RAWR! That in a nutshell encapsulated the Temur deck, as one of the most dragon forward decks we’ve ever seen from Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=SXMnWvLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-commanders.jpg?itok=IL1K8Ot_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Led by your choice of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/3/eshki-temurs-roar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Eshki, Temur’s Roar ">Eshki, Temur’s Roar </a>or <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/9/ureni-of-the-unwritten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ureni of the Unwritten">Ureni of the Unwritten</a>, you can see the focus here is on big creatures coming down fast. Eshki is a bit awkward as there are only a few creatures with power 6 or more to get the most from her ability. Ureni of the Unwritten is the more specific dragon focused commander and has a powerful ability that should have you put it in charge of this deck.</p>

<p>There are a fair number of new cards, including those from the main set. Exclusive to the Commander Deck I want to highlight <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/44/broodcaller-scourge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Broodcaller Scourge">Broodcaller Scourge</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/38/thundermane-dragon" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Thundermane Dragon">Thundermane Dragon</a>. The Broodcaller Scourge lets you cash in on the damage you’re doing with new permanents, synergizing particularly well with the <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=dragonstorm+set%3ATDM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Dragonstorms">Dragonstorms </a>(especially <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/101/breaching-dragonstorm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Breaching Dragonstorm">Breaching Dragonstorm</a>) to get a lot of value out of your attack. Helping get you there is Thundermane Dragon, who lets you play creatures with power 4 or more from the top of your deck, and gives them haste.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=VXfoQpUz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/temur-roar-broodcaller-scourge-and-thundermane-dragon.jpg?itok=CNS5mgUZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Temur Roar really stands out in terms of reprint value. The inclusion of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/218/hellkite-courser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hellkite Courser">Hellkite Courser</a>, a $20 card in its own right, is already a boon, but it’s accompanied by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/226/nogi-draco-zealot" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Nogi, Draco-Zealot">Nogi, Draco-Zealot </a>in that same price range due to previous scarcity. This is the first reprinting for Nogi since its very limited printing in Game Night 3, and the only non-foil version. They are joined by a number of other useful dragon related cards, and solid reprints, giving the deck the best monetary value of the bunch.</p>

<p>Temur Roar may not be a great Temur clan deck, but it is a good dragon pre-con. Become like Sarkhan Vol, and worship the dragons with this deck, and toss in whatever other dragons you have with it.</p>

<hr><p>What do you think is the best commander deck from the bunch?

            <p>
You know, I've always loved me a sky island in a video game. Can't really tell you why, I just think they're neat! So right from the get go I was pretty easily won over by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-skies">Lost Skies</a>, another one of those open world survival crafting type games. It's a genre I'm not easily won over by, I don't care for building things all that much, but the pull of the open air is pretty alluring to me. And I won't even have very long to see if I'll bounce off of its craftiness or not, because developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bossa-studios">Bossa Studios</a> announced today that Lost Skies is releasing into early access later this month on April 18th.
</p>

<p>
Being one of those kinds of games, there's the usual kinds of things you can expect in terms of building things, though the main thing you'll be building is your skyship. It looks pretty intricate too, lots of different parts you can attach and wiggle around. You can then take your ship out on large scale dogfights, which look a bit intimidating to be honest, but I'm sure a seasoned enough crew will be fine.

Speaking of your crew, you can play with up to five friends (or enemies, I suppose, that just doesn't sound very fun) as you explore the game's first region, the Outskirts. Future updates will apparently expand this area, as well as add in more places to explore, alongside general bug fixes, quality of life improvements, and a few additional features.
</p>
<p>
One thing I quite like is the game's Island Creator, which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102670/Lost_Skies_Island_Creator/">already download separately</a>. This is exactly what it sounds like, you can build and design your own islands, and in the main game you'll be able to download islands other people have made. Honestly this looks like enough of a game in its own right, kudos to Bossa Studios for fitting something like this in.
</p>
<p>
If you're not an early access person, Bossa Studios said they are currently planning to release it into 1.0 sometime this year, but otherwise, you can check it out April 18th.

<p>Hours ago, a claim surfaced on social media suggesting that ‘talk of a Fortnite movie’ that was originally passed on would be rethought given the success of Minecraft, which is enjoying the highest opening weekend <strong>ever </strong>for a video game movie.</p>



<p>It wasn’t too long after the claim had surfaced on Twitter (X) that it was shot down unceremoniously with a single word from the CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nope">Nope.</h2>



<p>In a now-deleted post on Twitter, DanielRPK wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You just know Fortnite is next. There was already talk of a Fortnite movie, but some studios passed on it. That’s obviously gonna change now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interjected with a single word</a> reply: ‘False.’</p>



<p>DanielRPK has since <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1908582823256338548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">followed up</a> by addressing Sweeney directly, asking whether it’s true that Sony ‘passed on the opportunity to make a Fortnite movie a few years ago.’ Sweeney has yet to respond to this comment at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Minecraft has turned heads this weekend, scoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a record of $58 million</a> on its first day at the box office. This has defied expectations, with many thinking the film would bomb because of it starring Jack Black and looking bizarre in early impressions and previews. </p>



<p>In recent years, live-action adaptations of video games have soared. The likes of Fallout and The Last of Us have dominated the charts and won prestigious awards, becoming known as some of the top titles in the space to make it to the silver screen.</p>



<p>It appears that Fortnite isn’t one of the games that’s set to get a movie adaptation any time soon, though.</p>



<p>Do you think Fortnite would work as a movie? Let me know what you think in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
I think if you were to show someone the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, complete with cats you-know-whating, a musical number, and a poop joke, they'd probably be taken quite aback. However, if you were to tell them that it's from the same people that made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/super-meat-boy">Super Meat Boy</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a>, I'm sure they'd be able to understand much quicker. Aside from coming from some pretty notable indie devs, there still might be the question of why it's such a big deal that Mewgenics finally got a trailer, and the answer to that is (kind of) simple: it was announced 13 years ago.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Mewgenics was originally meant to be a follow-up to Super Meat Boy, but was technically cancelled in 2016, with one of the main devs behind it, Edmund McMillen leaving Team Meat shortly after. McMillen shared a couple of years later that he acquired the rights to Mewgenics, and would be working on it with Tyler Glaiel. Now, seven years after that, the game actually has a trailer, and is even due to come out sometime in 2025.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Mewgenics - Official Trailer" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyWcrDKg9hA?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyWcrDKg9hA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Now, does this trailer at all tell you what the game is about? Apart from the fact that you'll breed cats, nope! But that's the pull of marketing, it gets you to explore further. Dig a little deeper (i.e. checking the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Steam page</a>) confirms that yes, it is in fact an "endless cat breeding RPG", but it's also a tactical, turn-based roguelike. It kind of looks like an incredibly unhinged <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a>, but instead of mechs you control cats you've bred to have different abilities. A lot to unpack here!
</p>
<p>
McMillen's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@souldescen">personal YouTube channel</a> actually has quite a few gameplay clips to peruse if the nightmare fuel trailer didn't do it for you. There's a real Tom Waits vibe to the music that I wasn't expecting but am fully into, I think I'll be checking this one out whenever it does arrive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>‘A Minecraft Movie’ has now become the biggest-ever opening day video game movie with a $58 million opening day.</p>



<p>The movie has also become the biggest opening day so far in 2025, surpassing ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ at $40.9 million.</p>



<p>It’s an impressive start for a movie that was forecasted to hit around $70 to $80 million in its opening weekend, but now updated forecasts predict that it will pass $150 million, 200% more than initial predicted. </p>



<p>The new forecast puts it in the running to surpass the biggest three-day opening ever for a video game movie, which is currently held by ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ at $146 million. Though, it should be worth noting that ‘The Super Mario Bros. Movie’ released on a Wednesday and had already grossed $58 million before the weekend.</p>



<p>The film stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Jennifer Coolidge.</p>



<p>That being said, ‘A Minecraft Movie’ will likely turn a profit after its first week, with the film having a $150 million production budget plus marketing and distribution costs.</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie’s staggering numbers does come as a bit of a shock to those familiar with the game, with many fans criticising the games trailers. Yet, the game is one, if not, the most popular video game ever, so it’s success isn’t too surprising to most.</p>



<p>The video game has sold over 300 million individual copies worldwide since its release in 2011, with its success attracting the eyes of Microsoft, who purchased Mojang (Minecraft’s developers) in 2014 for $2.5 billion.</p>

            <p>Physical copies of OG Switch games upgraded for Nintendo Switch 2, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, will seemingly ship with original Switch 1 cartridges.</p>
<p>That's according to a Nintendo support representative in the UK, who reportedly confirmed in writing that the Switch 2 "enhanced" editions themselves will have to be downloaded separately via "download codes" and then applied to the original version on the cart.</p>

<p>Whilst the exact question posed to the customer rep is not provided, Does It Play on X/Twitter tweeted an image of an email response allegedly taken from a customer services conversation that reportedly stated: "Yes, we can confirm that the upgrades will be download codes. Thank you for your understanding".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">According to a Nintendo UK Support Rep, Switch 2 Editions of physical games like Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Metroid Prime 4 contain a download code for the upgrade pack along with a Switch 1 version cart of the game <a href="https://t.co/SK5uo4Thyf">https://t.co/SK5uo4Thyf</a> <a href="https://t.co/vRhUnxTvIX">pic.twitter.com/vRhUnxTvIX</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1908538278543786494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1908540986956923197">As Wario64 rightly points out</a>, this wouldn't be the first time a customer service rep unwittingly gave out inaccurate information - so we've reached out to Nintendo for confirmation - and there's nothing on the box art we've seen thus far that suggests a separate download is required.</p>
<p>"And it's weird they would be codes when Nintendo is pivoting to game key carts instead of download codes of retail games," Wario64 added. "I know game key carts are different, I'm highlighting it because it shows Nintendo is offering that solution instead of download codes for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, so offering a code for the upgrade pack doesn't make sense (they could put the upgrade pack as a license on the cart)."</p>
<p>As a commenter <a href="https://x.com/UltraJohnus/status/1908545794161942790">points out</a>, it all feels "needlessly convoluted", although others suggest it's "part of the plan".</p>
<p>"Pretty simple. If you resell the Switch 2 key cart, then the new person will have to purchase the upgrade pack. More money for Nintendo. Sounds like part of the plan," <a href="https://x.com/Setebos_Caliban/status/1908544726094987748">opined one</a>.</p>
<p>We'll try and clear things up as/when Nintendo comes back to us.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">Stateside Nintendo fans will have to wait a little bit longer before they can pre-order a Switch 2</a> after Nintendo of American confirmed that US preorders - which were scheduled to go live on 9th April - will now be delayed "in order to assess the potential impact of [President Trump's] tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has confirmed with Nintendo that there are no current plans to adjust the ongoing pre-order process here in the UK.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-physx-and-flow-are-now-fully-open-source/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been around <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-physx-goes-open-source-4-0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">six and a half years</a> since the NVIDIA PhysX SDK went open source under the 3-Clause BSD license. However, not all of it was actually open source. This changed only recently, with the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/PhysX/releases/tag/107.0-physx-5.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release on GitHub</a> of the GPU simulation kernel source code. Here's the message shared by NVIDIA, along with the release of the shader implementation of the Flow SDK:</p>
<p><em>We’re excited to share that the latest update to the PhysX SDK now includes all the GPU source code, fully licensed under BSD-3!</em></p>
<p><em>With over 500 CUDA kernels powering features such as rigid body dynamics, fluid simulation, and deformable objects, GPU PhysX represents one of the most advanced real-time simulation use cases of CUDA and GPU programming. We hope this release will be a valuable resource for learning, experimentation, and development across the community.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, we’re also open-sourcing the full GPU compute shader implementation of the Flow SDK, our real-time, sparse grid–based fluid simulation library.</em></p>
<p>NVIDIA PhysX is a name we haven't used for a long while until very recently, when users found out that NVIDIA had dropped support for the new GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards. This caused users to seek unorthodox solutions, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/user-combines-rtx-3050-rtx-5090-massive-boost-nvidia-physx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pairing an RTX 50 GPU with an RTX 3050 dedicated solely to PhysX</a>.</p>
<p>This only really affects a few old PC games, like Batman: Arkham Asylum and Mirror's Edge. Still, the release of the GPU simulation kernel source mode means modders could fix the problem entirely if they so choose. Needless to say, it would have been better if NVIDIA had fixed the issue themselves, but at least this open source release gives modders the chance to do something about it. Of course, we'll keep an eye on any mod releases that take advantage of the newly available GPU simulation kernel source code.</p>

            <p>
It's not exactly much of a secret that a lot of indie devs are struggling to stay afloat these days given the economic *gestures vaguely at a world map.* No one has an exact solution either, but last December, just before the release of its latest game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>, noted indie developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/heartmachine">Heart Machine</a> announced that they were opening a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/HeartMachineHQ/home">Patreon</a>. I won't act like this is exactly a novel concept, I've seen a few other devs, typically on the smaller or solo size, try the same thing. But it still felt like a sign that Heart Machine needed a bit of a boost to keep things going.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Heart Machine founder Alx Preston recently spoke with The Verge at GDC about the team's reasoning behind starting the Patreon, offering up some pretty candid explanations. "The Patreon’s there, really, to open up to the community and talk about certain things when it comes to game development," Preston said. "I think there’s still a lot of distance between developers traditionally and the audience that consumes what they make — what we make — so finding ways to dig back in and have a conversation there is important."
</p>
<p>
Obviously, money is a factor too - "Industry dynamics have changed a lot, so money is tough to come by in a lot of ways," Preston said, continuing, "Whatever we can do to support ourselves and stay alive longer term is an important thing to turn to, as well." Preston did make the point that the Patreon isn't a huge piece of the studio's revenue, but if "you keep engaging and keep doing more stuff there, it’s a different model than going to publishers for money all the time."
</p>
<p>
Quite aptly, he said that right now it's the "experimental phase of figuring out what the f*ck works these days." Honestly, power to them for giving something like this ago. Getting a finished game out feels like a bit of a miracle these days, so I hope the extra support does pan out.
</p>
<p>
Right now Heart Machine are working on the aforementioned Hyper Light Breaker, a more live-servicey sequel to 2016's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>. When it launched into early access earlier this year, the overall package <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breaker-early-access-review">didn't really work all that well</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Personally I haven't gone back to it since then, I'm waiting on a few more updates to arrive, even if I'm not entirely sold on its radical departure from the original game just yet. The other game it's working on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/possessors-is-a-side-scroller-from-the-folks-behind-hyper-light-drifter">Possessor(s)</a>, might be a bit more up my alley though. Fingers crossed the team can keep things going!

<p>Rise of the Ronin released on Steam on 11th March 2025, and it's currently sitting on a "mixed" user score, with just 57 percent of the 3118 reviewers opting to award it a positive rating.</p>
<p>Like many other PC ports of late, much of the criticism is aimed squarely at the game's "<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/HatedSovietLion/recommended/1340990/">horrible</a>" optimisation, including issues with enemies loading in for bossfights, missing NPCs, invisible walls, and missing assets like ladders.</p>
<p>"I really like the gameplay, the combat, maybe the exploration (it has its issues, though) but I can't recommend this game in good faith when it has some of the most terrible optimisation ever," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/someone64/recommended/1340990/">explained</a> one player.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We are currently investigating reported issues for "Rise of the Ronin" Steam version. </p><p>Currently we are preparing a patch, which will be released 4/10 (Thu.), to fix or improve some of these issues.</p><p>We sincerely apologize for any inconveniences that you may have experienced.</p></div>— Team NINJA (@TeamNINJAStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1907734825894600960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"Not only that, but they managed to update the game to make it both look AND perform worse in an attempt to band-aid fix the performance issues, effectively ruining something I could at least enjoy before."</p>
<p>"A shame, the game seems quite good, but the port is just not worth paying any money for," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148598345/recommended/1340990/">opined another</a>. "Performance is abysmal, frame rates above 60 fps lead to issues and bugs, and the only way to get a frame rate close to anything playable is to set lots of graphical options to the lowest, leading to a very poor image. I would love to play the game, but nobody should be paying for a port in a state like this."</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rise-of-the-ronin-review">awarded Rise of the Ronin four out of five stars</a> in Eurogamer's review, saying: "[Developer] Team Ninja borrows the open-world familiarity and historical tourism of Assassin's Creed while adapting its own breed of hardcore action for the mainstream."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It wouldn’t be until 2019 that I’d pick up a Switch and still, it wasn’t until the summer of last year, 2024, that I’d put serious miles on it. The slim form factor and enormous game catalog made it a perfect companion for NYC subway trips, picnic hangs with friends, and late-night gaming in bed with a machine that didn’t tire my arms the way the heavier Steam Deck does.

<p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hoyoverse">HoYoVerse</a> teased the news on 1st April and shared an image of a Bangboo daubed in Xbox-flavoured branding.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-is-currently-testing-the-one-thing-that-makes-every-game-better-fishing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Fishing! It's a feature that's been included in many games over the years, one that varies in quality from game to game. Sega Bass Fishing? Probably top of the line, as long as you have that unique fishing rod controller. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>? I like it, but I know plenty of people that hate it. Personally I normally find it quite a relaxing thing to do, particularly in games that are otherwise combat focused. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> is one such game that's more about shooting rather than chilling out, but over on the public test server you can now try out its version of fishing.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Those of you on the PTS (I hear that's what the cool kids call it) can now head to a new area in the boggy Mire region called Fisherman's Rest. There's three new characters here, Captain Raymond Clark, someone literally just called The Fisherman, and Linda-Lee, a giant hermit crab. A likely bunch in a world like Fallout's.
</p>
<p>
To get your probably not brand-spanking-new fishing rod you need to start the Casting Off quest. You'll find that by following a signal on your Pip-Boy in the Mire. A <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server">blog post</a> detailing the fishing patch notes that the way you know if you can fish somewhere is a simple mantra: "If I can swim, then I can fish."
</p>
<p>
When you actually get to fish, you'll need to use different kinds of bait, take weather conditions into consideration - Radstorms will help you find a glowing fish - though I can't tell you how the fishing part actually works other than the fact a fish command comes up in deep bodies of water. Sounds like it might be pretty automatic, which is a bit of a shame.
</p>
<p>
There's lots of different fish to catch, which you can eat to restore some health, but you can also turn them into fish bits (awful name), which lets you cook a new grilled fish recipe. This one "provides you with an effect that reduces the time to hook a fish for 20 minutes," something that feels quite messed up when you consider you're using the life of a fish to help you catch more fish. You'll also find daily fishing quests where you can unlock more recipes too.
</p>
<p>
Currently Bethesda is targeting a June release for those that don't play on the PTS, so you don't exactly have to wait that long if you want some bugs ironed out first.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/whats-the-best-starter-weed-recipe-to-sell-in-schedule-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here, it’s almost certain that you’re trying to figure out what is the best weed recipe in Schedule 1. To start, it can be fairly complicated to start growing, but there’s big money to be had with some of the better recipes in the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-weed-recipes-in-schedule-1">Best Starting Weed Recipes in Schedule 1</h2>



<p>When starting off in Schedule 1, you won’t have the best ingredients and equipment to start, but luckily, you’ll be able to get all of the ingredients you need from the Gas-Mart. Unfortunately, though, these recipes do not create the highest quality strains of weed, but are a good way to build up cash to take your empire to the next level. Here’s some of our favourites: </p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-1">OG Kush Strain 1</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $118</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Jennerising, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Gingeritis, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-2">OG Kush Strain 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Donut, Mouth Wash, Cuke, Banana, Viagra, Flu Medicine</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $127</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Jennerising, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Gingeritis, Tropic Thunder, Sedating</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-3">OG Kush Strain 3</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Banana, Cuke, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $80</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Jennerising, Thought-Provoking, Energizing, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-og-kush-strain-4">OG Kush Strain 4</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Mouth Wash, Cuke, Viagra, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $103</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Anti-Gravity, Balding, Thought-Provoking, Tropic Thunder, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-sour-diesel-1">Sour Diesel 1</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Cuke, Flu Medicine, Banana</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $71</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Refreshing, Thought-Provoking, Sedating, Gingeritis</p>



<h4 id="h-sour-diesel-2">Sour Diesel 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Cuke, Flu Medicine, Mega Bean</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $81</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Refreshing, Cyclopean, Sedating, Foggy</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-1">Green Crack 1 </h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Viagra, Horse Semen</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $77</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Energizing, Tropic Thunder, Long Faced</p>



<h4 id="h-green-crack-2">Green Crack 2</h4>



<p><strong>Ingredients –</strong> Gasoline, Viagra</p>



<p><strong>Sell Price –</strong> $65</p>



<p><strong>Effects –</strong> Bright-Eyed, Toxic, Tropic Thunder</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-weed-strain-to-start">The Best Weed Strain to Start</h2>



<p>One of the better strains from the list is <strong>OG Kush Strain 3</strong>, which only requires two ingredients that can be obtains from the very beginning. What’s even better is that the ingredients will only set you back a mere $6 with a sell price of $80, giving you a nice profit from the get-go. </p>



<p>Remember, that starting off with some of the cheaper strains is a good way to gain money fast, but conscious that you’ll need to continue on innovating and producing higher quality strains to keep your customers happy. </p>

          <p>Road trips with just two people always have their awkward silences. In&nbsp;<em>Dustland Delivery</em>, my character, a sharpshooter, has tried to break the ice with the blacksmith he hired a few towns back, with only intermittent success.</p>
<p>Remember that bodyguard, the one I unsuccessfully tried to flirt with at that bar? The blacksmith was uninterested. What about that wily junk dealer, or the creepy cemetery? Silence. She only wanted to discuss "Abandoned train" and "Abandoned factory," even though, in this post-apocalypse, abandonment was not that rare. But I made a note to look out for any rusted remains; stress and mood are far trickier to fix than hunger and thirst.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943280/Dustland_Delivery/"><em>Dustland Delivery</em></a>, available through Steam for Windows (and Proton/Steam Deck), puts you in the role typically taken up by NPCs in other post-apocalyptic RPGs. You're a trader, buying cheap goods in one place to sell at a profit elsewhere, and working the costs of fuel, maintenance, and raider attacks into your margins. You're in charge of everything on your trip: how fast you drive, when to rest and set up camp, whether to approach that caravan of pickups or give them a wide berth.</p>
<p>Some of you, the types whose favorite part of&nbsp;<em>The Oregon Trail</em> was the trading posts, might already be sold. For the others, let me suggest that the game is stuffed full of little bits of weird humor and emergent storytelling, and a wild amount of replayability for what is currently a $5 game. There are three quest-driven scenarios, plus a tutorial, in the base game. A new DLC out this week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559340/Dustland_Delivery_Sheol/"><em>Sheol</em></a>, adds underground cities, ruins expeditions, more terrains, and a final story quest for four more dollars.</p>
