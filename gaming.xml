		<p>Dead By Daylight’s 2v8 mode is back for a limited time and it will feature two iconic franchises. The Silent Hill x Castlevania crossover will see Pyramid Head and Dracula team up to hunt down the survivors. As mentioned this is going to be a limited time run, starting today and ending on November 20th. You can see the character designs in the trailer below.</p>

<p>This is the fifth time the 2v8 mode has been added to Dead By Daylight, with previous entries featuring characters from the likes of Resident Evil, Scream’s Ghost Face, and The Oni. Dead By Daylight is still one of Behaviour Interactive’s main focuses having cancelled Project T last year, but the team is also working on publishing Blight: Survival, which is being developed by Haenir Studio. Blight: Survival is a PvE survival game set in the medieval era where players face off against monsters and men. A small teaser for that was released last week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Kiborg developer Sobaka Studios is switching genres with its next game, moving from a roguelite beat ’em up to a party game that stars chickens. Chicken Chicken will see up to eight players compete against each other online in a variety of challenges to come out on top. A demo is being released today on Steam and Epic Game Store, which will have three of the events players will face off against each other in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chiken Chiken - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJ9yOX1mDi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We come from a background of dark, violent action games like&nbsp;KIBORG, so&nbsp;Chicken Chicken&nbsp;might seem a bit unusual,”</em> said Dmitry Kachkov, Head of Sobaka Studio. <em>“But when you feel the pain of reaching the top of the mountain in Climbing Up…and someone hits you with a rocket launcher and sends you all the way to the bottom, you will understand.”</em></p>
<p>The list of the events available in the Chicken Chicken demo are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cars – players will race against each other to collect seed bags and deliver them to a giant chicken at the top of a mountain.</li>
<li>Climbing Up – players are tasked with climbing up a mountain made of old buildings while evading cannons dotted around the map, and rockets from the launchers other players can pick up.</li>
<li>Swamp – the one team game in this demo where two teams are tethered to a giant chicken and attempt to catch flies. Breaking the tether or falling into the swamp are two issues that need to be avoided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chicken Chicken is due to release in 2026. In our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/">Kiborg</a>, Adrian wrote, <em>“Too much of my time with Kiborg was spent thinking how much more fun I’d be having if the game dumped the roguelite elements and just went full old-school third person action brawler. So many of its failings could be ignored in that form. Instead, Kiborg is a slightly underwhelming rougelite that looks like it should be far more fun that it is.”</em></p>

<header><section>
<p>This will go down well</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="97803bc08af8a"><a title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/97803bc08af8a/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix has laid out plans to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI by 2027.</p>
<p>This comes via a progress report on the company's <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">'Square Enix Reboots and Awakens'</a> business plan (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/">VGC</a>) in which it hopes to turn its fortunes around and become a true industry leader. It states that it has initiated a partnership with the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory at the University of Tokyo, aimed at "improving the efficiency of game development processes through AI technologies"</p>
<p>So as part of this, Square Enix is looking to automate 70% of QA and debugging tasks with generative AI, with hopes to "improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development".</p>
<p>The partnership is currently comprised of "researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory UTokyo, and engineers from the SQUARE ENIX group", resulting in a team of over ten members.</p>
<figure data-uuid="e4397d300ab87"><a title="SE Report" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4397d300ab87/se-report.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this decision will likely be met with mixed reception from fans. On the one hand, QA is said to be a tedious task, but ultimately utilising more and more AI is just going to result in more job losses. And who knows just how accurate AI will prove to be when diagnosing issues? It's a tricky one.</p>
<p>Square Enix's announcement comes just after EA launched a new partnership with Stability AI to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p>
<p>EA had presumably predicted the negative response to this announcement, and stressed that human creators will still be the driving force at the company, stating that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream".</p>

Some of these monsters are getting Mega Evolutions, and we already know Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur will definitely be getting these powerful transformations next month. And because these three were confirmed in today’s trailer, we also probably know all the others that will be added thanks to fans datamining the game.</span></p>  <p><span>The supposed list of new Megas that began circulating last month included Raichu, Chimecho, and Baxcalibur, so it stands to reason that it’s at least a partial view of what new Mega forms will debut in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>. Notably, some Pokémon who already have Mega Evolutions in the base game are supposedly getting a second Mega Evolution that fans are calling “Z” forms, but it’s unclear at the moment what they’ll actually be called in-game. The full list reads as follows:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu X</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Raichu Y</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Chimecho</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Absol</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Staraptor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Garchomp</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>New Mega form for Lucario</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golurk</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Meowstic</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Crabominable</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Golisopod</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Magearna</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Scovillain</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Glimmora</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Tatsugiri</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baxcalibur</span></li> </ul> <p><span>I’m not holding my breath, but it would be cool if there were even more Mega Evolutions that we don’t know about. Corviknight, the armored bird from the Galar region, is shown in the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>trailer, and one of my favorites, so I would love it if he got a surprise Mega form as well. I can’t get too greedy, though. Raichu is finally getting a Mega Evolution after a decade of disrespect, so I should probably just shut the fuck up.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>appears to take place in the post-game, so you will likely have to beat the main story before you can play it. You better get to grinding up those Z-A Royale ranks if you haven’t </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>seen the credits yet</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is shutting down yet another studio that was working on a game that, likely, won’t see a release. In a post on social media, studio head Sean Crooks announced that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors on November 17 after the parent company pulled funding. </p>



<p>That just so happens to be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-is-closing-one-of-its-studios-after-just-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same day as another NetEase studio</a>, Fantastic Pixel Castle, will be closed.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, Crooks said that the closure comes despite “best efforts” to find a new partner for the studio and its game.</p>



<div><p><strong>“Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft,”</strong> he said. <strong>“What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</strong></p><p><strong>“The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.”</strong></p></div>



<p>Bad Brain Game Studios was formed in May 2023 with Crooks, who was a producer on games like Watch Dogs: Legion, at the helm. The studio has been working on a game known as Midnight Riders, which was set to be open world action-adventure game with a 1980’s aesthetic. You can check out the game’s sizzle reel below, courtesy of Crooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>An Update on Bad Brain Game Studios</p><p>It’s with a heavy heart that we share that Bad Brain Game Studios will be closing its doors. Our last official day of operation will be on November 17th.</p><p>Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent.</p><p>The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you.</p><p>As we close this chapter,&nbsp;the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</p><p>To help support our people as they take their next steps, we’ll also be releasing a sizzle reel from the project publicly, giving everyone the chance to showcase their incredible work and open doors to new opportunities.</p><p>If you’re looking for world-class developers, artists, and storytellers, please reach out — we would be proud to connect you with them.</p><p>Finally, I want to extend my deepest gratitude once again to everyone who supported us along the way. Your encouragement and belief in what we were building meant the world to us. While this chapter is ending sooner than we had hoped, the spirit of what we created at Bad Brain will live on through the incredible people who made it possible.</p><p>Sean Crooks<br>Studio Head</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“Wouldn’t it be cool if BLANK met BLANK?” is a question fans have asked each other for a long time, and occasionally we get an actual, official answer. Whether it be two different rival comic book companies<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dcs-batmandeadpool-1-to-feature-crossovers-between-nightwing-and-wolverine-harley-quinn-and-hulk-and-more"><u> joining forces for a big crossover</u></a>, a hodgepodge of<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-mortal-kombat-1-the-t-1000-has-a-skeleton-intestines-a-heart-and-a-soul"><u> outside IP inclusions in a fighting game</u></a>, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/freddy-vs-jason"><u>two slasher icons finally facing off</u></a> thanks to the rights to one of them swapping studios, we’ve seen some notable events of this sort through the years. Then the MCU caused an explosion in the idea of a shared movie universe akin to what comic books have long offered, with the likes of the Conjuring Universe, the DCEU (and now the DCU), and more exploring a larger world that allows for characters and concepts to freely interact with each other across multiple projects. Still, Alien and Predator deserve credit for being early to this idea, even as their own exploration of the concept has ebbed and flowed a <em>lot</em> through the decades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the new film <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-badlands"><u>Predator: Badlands</u></a> is getting attention for its prominent use of Weyland-Yutani, the organization that has been a major part of the Alien franchise since the start. Yet this is hardly the first time Alien and Predator have bled over…and sometimes bled <em>on</em>…each other, with a history that includes everything from fun easter eggs to outright direct crossovers across multiple media. So let’s look back at the history of these two franchises intersecting, and the long road to the idea becoming officially integrated into the core canon films.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>It’s All Thanks to Comic Books</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator"><u>first Predator movie</u></a> came out in 1987, eight years after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Movie_-_Alien_(1979)"><u>original Alien</u></a>. A big hit in its own right, Predator’s timing was also notable, coming out just a year removed from the major success of 1986’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Movie_-_Aliens_(1986)"><u>Aliens</u></a>, the first Alien sequel. There were some innate, albeit basic, similarities in the films, beginning on the corporate side. Both movies were owned and released by 20th Century Fox, something that would prove to be key to allowing crossovers without the legal hurdles that can often curtail such a thing. But more than that, both films were about a visually distinctive and notably dangerous alien creature fighting humans, and while the Alien movies were set in the future and Predator in the present, there was no reason to think either species hadn’t been around and would continue to be around for a long time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1988, Dark Horse Comics began publishing Aliens-branded comic books, and it was a quick success, proving the appeal to that title beyond the films. Both 20th Century Fox and Dark Horse were clearly pleased with the results; in 1989, Dark Horse put out their first licensed Predator comic book limited series as well. Then, well, it’s actually quite impressive how quickly the two were pitted against each other, especially when you consider how new Predator was as a title at all. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There was no reason to think either species hadn’t been around and would continue to be around for a long time.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Horse’s Chris Warner is credited with being the one to first suggest bringing the two extraterrestrial threats up against each other in comic book form, telling <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180801221308/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-creator-of-alien-vs-predator-looks-back-on-his-classic-and-his-new-predator-books" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Syfy Wire</u></a> in 2018, “It’s a pretty obvious idea. When you say, ‘Ali vs. Frazier, King Kong vs. Godzilla, Aliens vs. Predator,’ the ideas just exploded. You hear the adage, ‘It almost wrote itself.' Well, it almost wrote itself.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As 1989 came to a close, a three-part storyline was launched in the black-and-white anthology series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/comics/dark-horse-presents-vol-1"><u>Dark Horse Presents</u></a>, except its true interconnected nature was saved for the end. In Dark Horse Presents #34, readers got an Aliens story, and then in issue #35, a Predator story. But then came Dark Horse Presents #36, with a cover that read “Aliens vs. Predator” among the list of that issue's stories and accompanying art showing one of each species in battle. And just like that, a major sub-franchise/spin-off connected to two other established franchises was born. </p><p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/dark-horse-presents-36-alien-predator-1762384103917.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The cover of Dark Horse Presents #36 (Feb. 1990)</figcaption></figure></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">That first Dark Horse Presents story was in fact a lead-in to a full<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alien/Comic_-_Aliens_vs._Predator_(1989)"><u> Aliens vs. Predator five-issue limited series</u></a>, which launched in the summer of 1990. Some of the core elements of this comic, including the Predators hunting xenomorphs as a rite of passage, and a partnership forming between the intelligent Predators and a human (in this case, Machiko Noguchi, a colonist on the planet Ryushi) against the insect-like, monstrous Aliens, would be explored further and echoed in many other stories that followed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That first limited series was a hit, and from then on, AVP (as it quickly became commonly referred to) was a go-to concept for Dark Horse, even as they continued to publish independent Aliens and Predator comics. For nearly 30 years, until the rights to both properties would change hands after Disney bought 20th Century Fox, and subsequent Alien and Predator comics would move to Marvel, Dark Horse would revisit Aliens vs. Predator in various limited series, one-shots, and short stories. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The First Movie Connection </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When the initial Aliens vs. Predator limited series launched in 1990, it was a big year for Predator in general. Just as that comic series was wrapping up, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-2"><u>Predator 2</u></a> hit theaters, and with it came the arrival of arguably one of the biggest and most tantalizing easter eggs in franchise movie history up to that point. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Predator 2’s conclusion, LA cop Mike Harrigan (Danny Glover) follows the Predator he’s been battling onto its ship, and comes across a trophy wall which is covered in skulls from previous successful Predator hunts. Some of these skulls are human, but many are from various alien species which were created just for Predator 2…except, most notably, a large freaking ALIEN skull that is very clearly in the shape of a xenomorph. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/05/image2-1762376255375.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A glimpse of a xenomorph skull in the climactic sequence from Predator 2 (1990)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who is old enough to remember, I can tell you that even in a pre-Internet era, seeing this huge connection between the two franchises actually appearing in a movie was a big deal, and immediately had many fans hyped for the implications and potential. For those of us who had been reading the Aliens vs. Predator comic especially, this seemed like a huge signal that a movie version was imminent, and how cool would <em>that</em> be!? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those involved have said there were no real conversations about making an Aliens vs. Predator movie at the time, and that the easter egg was intended as simply a fun reference, not a promise of anything to come. Moreso, they downplayed the AVP comic book as an influence, saying it was more of an in-joke over the fact that legendary special effects makeup creator Stan Winston had worked on both Alien and Predator films. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that didn’t stop fans from speculating about the possibilities, that’s for sure… </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Read All About It</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the 1990s, Dark Horse kept publishing Aliens vs. Predator comics, with the concept eventually expanding into books as well. In 1994, the novel Aliens vs. Predator: Prey was published, featuring an adaptation of the first AVP comic book limited series. Besides its subtitle, foreshadowing a title eventually used for a Predator film, this book also stands out as the source for the name “Yautja” for the Predator species, something that would remain true in all Predator media since then and later find its way into the films. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two more AVP novels – Aliens vs. Predator: Hunter's Planet and Aliens vs. Predator: War – would shortly follow to form a connected trilogy with the first book. After that, things stayed quiet on the AVP book front until 2016’s Alien vs. Predator: Armageddon. This book took a page from the original Dark Horse Presents AVP story by serving as the concluding chapter to two earlier novels – Predator: Incursion and Alien: Invasion – that had been released with only Alien or Predator branding, though they told one complete story. More recently, 2022 saw the release of two AVP books – an anthology titled Aliens vs. Predators: Ultimate Prey, and the standalone story, Aliens vs. Predators: Rift War. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Games Aplenty</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if there was nothing being planned for the movies just yet, 20th Century Fox clearly saw that the Aliens vs. Predator concept could have a life beyond the printed page. Shortly before the first AVP book was released, the concept also made its first leap into video games with 1993’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-snes"><u>Alien vs. Predator for the SNES</u></a>, which was a side-scrolling beat-'em-up where you play as a Predator taking on one xenomorph after another. That same year saw a Game Boy release as well, Alien vs. Predator: The Last of His Clan. This was then followed by a different game, also just called<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-arcade"><u> Alien vs. Predator, for arcades</u></a> in 1994, which had four selectable characters to choose from, including two different Predators and two human cyborgs…one of whom was Arnold Schwarzenegger's character Dutch from the first Predator movie! While none of these games are identical in setting or story, they do share the same basic side-scrolling approach to Alien fighting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That would change with another 1994 release, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-jaguar"><u>Alien vs. Predator game for the Atari Jaguar</u></a>. This game was AVP’s introduction to the realm of first-person shooters and also had players changing perspectives between humans (in the form of Colonial Marines, as introduced in Aliens), Predators, and even xenomorphs depending on the level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This quick glut of AVP games would then lead to some time off before the concept was revisited in 1999 with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-versus-predator"><u>Aliens Versus Predator PC game</u></a>, which told its own story while heavily echoing the Jaguar game’s approach via another FPS where you play as an Alien, Predator, or Colonial Marine at various stages. This was followed by a 2002 sequel, the cleverly titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-versus-predator-2"><u>Aliens Versus Predator 2</u></a>, while the Alien/Predator/Colonial Marine approach would be used yet <em>again</em> in 2003’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-extinction"><u>PS2 and Xbox release, Aliens Versus Predator: Extinction</u></a>, though Extinction was instead a real-time strategy game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the AVP movies were released in the mid-aughts (more on those in a moment), some forgettable tie-in games came out as well, including an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alien-vs-predator-mobile"><u>Alien vs. Predator mobile game</u></a> in 2004 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-requiem"><u>PlayStation Portable’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem</u></a> in 2007. And though the decidedly poor reaction to the Requiem movie put an end to the AVP movies (for now?), the concept would still result in a couple more self-contained games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another FPS featuring – you guessed it – Aliens, Predators, and Colonial Marines as playable characters, the 2010 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/aliens-vs-predator-2010"><u>Aliens vs. Predator game for PC, PS3 and Xbox 360</u></a> stands as the most recent full AVP game released for any system, with the exception of 2013’s poorly received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avp-evolution"><u>AVP: Evolution</u></a> mobile game. At this point, it’s now been 12 years since the last Alien vs. Predator game, which is the longest gap since they began making AVP games in 1993. somehow, though, I would bet we’ll get another one at <em>some</em> point. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Those Actual AVP Movies</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With no individual Alien or Predator film being made at the time, 2004 saw that Predator 2 tease finally get paid off on a movie screen, as 20th Century Fox released<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-vs-predator"><u> Alien vs. Predator</u></a> in theaters. And man was it…not worth the wait. Yes, sadly, the first AVP movie was a poorly constructed letdown with weak characters and unmemorable action. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first live-action Alien-connected story to be set in the present day, the film did lean into some established Alien lore by including the character Charles Bishop Weyland. Played by Lance Henriksen, he was a bit of a double reference, since Charles is the founder of Weyland Industries – obviously meant to be the precursor to Alien’s powerful and usually antagonistic corporation, Weyland-Yutani – while his middle name, and the casting of Henriksen, indicated that he was the physical template for Henriksen’s earlier character, the synthetic Bishop in 1986’s Aliens. There were also some echoes of that first Aliens vs. Predator comic, given the story eventually involves a human female protagonist (here, Sanaa Lathan’s Lex) needing to team with a Predator against the mutual threat of the xenomorphs.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The first AVP movie was a poorly constructed letdown with weak characters and unmemorable action.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The first AVP movie made enough money to lead to a sequel in 2007, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem, which didn’t include any returning human characters, but did continue the earlier film’s amusing set up of a “Predalien,” a xenomorph who had gestated within a Predator. Despite the film’s pre-release hype pushing its R rating (after the previous AVP was PG-13), Requiem was another muddled mess, delivering a poorly conceived, not to mention poorly lit, film that failed to capitalize on what people love about the two title characters. And so that was it for actually putting Aliens and Predators together in a movie, at least for the time being. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that imagery from the AVP movies was used as the basis for much of the Alien vs. Predator house that was part of Universal’s Halloween Horror Nights in 2014 (in both Orlando and Hollywood) and again in 2015 (Hollywood only). As weak as the AVP movies were, these were very cool and visually impressive houses, and something we’re not likely to see again. Now that Alien and Predator are owned by Disney, an HHN partnership isn’t going to happen again, not unless something major changes in terms of the adversarial theme park dynamic between Disney and Universal. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alien Vs. Predator maze at Universal Studio Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when the Alien vs. Predator movies first came out, it felt like some of the backstory for these two creatures would be difficult to match what the other Alien and Predator films had established. These days, like the comics, books, and games before them, both AVP movies are pretty much considered non-canon to the two separate central movie franchises that begat them…especially once Ridley Scott’s Alien prequel, Prometheus, established a different founder (Peter Weyland, played by Guy Pearce) for a slightly different company now named Weyland Corp. Once again, that Predator 2 xenomorph skull is the only actual core canon connection the two series have had with each other…until now.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Modern Resurgence</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With Alien and Predator now in their Disney-owned 20th Century<em> Studios</em> era, both franchises have been successfully revived in recent years. In 2022, Dan Trachtenberg’s 18th century-set <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/prey-2022"><u>Prey </u></a>brought an exciting new flair to the Predator films, which he continued in his animated anthology, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-killer-of-killers"><u>Predator: Killer of Killers</u></a>, released this summer. Alien, meanwhile, returned to the big screen via 2024’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-romulus"><u>Alien: Romulus</u></a>, while Fargo’s Noah Hawley brought xenomorphs to TV for the first time this year in the FX series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/alien-romulus"><u>Alien: Earth</u></a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Romulus and Prey had zero connections to anything outside of their own respective realms, things are changing in a big way in 2025 with Predator: Badlands, which also brings the Predator series back to movie theaters after Prey and Killer of Killers were released on Hulu. In Badlands, one of the central characters – Elle Fanning’s Thia – is an android who teams with a Predator. But she’s not just <em>any</em> android; she’s a Weyland-Yutani synthetic, giving a very prominent role to a character directly connected to Alien lore. Other pre-release material has confirmed the film has plenty of Weyland-Yutani involvement, including a second synthetic played by Fanning, and an army made up of an identical male synthetic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trachtenberg told <a href="https://ew.com/comic-con-preview-movie-predator-badlands-11765860" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>EW</u></a> this all came about because he first had the idea for a Predator to team with a robot, "and then the next thought was, wait a minute, I know a company that makes robots. And that led to the Weyland-Yutani synth of it all.” Trying to keep expectations in check, he’s also stressed Badlands is a “toe-dip” crossover; don’t expect something more in terms of xenomorphs showing up for a full AVP detour. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But of course, it’s hard not to speculate on what might come next for the two concepts. There remains the potential for another true showdown that hopefully can be accomplished in a more satisfying way than the two AVP movies. We now have both series moving forward on a regular basis – a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-fede-alvarez-will-produce-but-not-direct-the-sequel"><u>sequel to Alien: Romulus </u></a>is on the way – alongside this newfound development of an actual major canon connection between them. And sure, this comes after a lot of other shared universes have been seen in films in recent years, but giving credit where it’s due, the idea of Alien and Predator being connected was first set up literally decades ago. They deserve another chance!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predator: Badlands will be released in theaters on November 7, 2025. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-alien-connection-continues-a-crossover-concept-going-back-decades]]></content:encoded>

But the monsters lurking in the shadows ensure that you never get too confident.</p><p>If you've been looking for a place to learn more about all REPO monsters, including the 10 new additions of the Monster update, this guide has you covered with details about behaviors, danger levels, and exactly how fearsome each of them is.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597359" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597359"></a><figcaption>Gnomes are as annoying as they are dangerous.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597359-20251030231932_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Gnome">Gnome</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 20</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>The gnome will usually be in packs, and will target you as a group.

You'll need at least one other person to be able to hold and throw them against a solid surface, as they're prone to breaking free.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597376-20251030231219_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597376" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597376-20251030231219_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597376"></a><figcaption>What's up?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597376-20251030231219_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Upscream">Upscream</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 50</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 10</li></ul><p>The Upscream's main attack is easy to guess by the name alone, as they have a knack for screaming at your face.

In order to know they're around, keep an eye out for footsteps, as well as breath, which can sometimes be seen coming from walls. When you're detected, the Hidden will try to grab you to take you around the map. You'll need either a weapon or a ton of strength to take the monster down. If you're lucky and you spot them before they do, you can try to crouch underneath an item to stay undetected.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597360" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597360"></a><figcaption>The Headman is a big fan of jump scares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597360-repo1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Headman">Headman</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 50</li></ul><p>The Headman is a floating head that usually roams around halls and rooms searching for their next target. When you're spotted, they'll start a chase to try and bite you. The best way to avoid them is to have them lose sight of you. Or, in the instance that the monster targets a teammate, use that opportunity to make a run for it. Just make sure to actually try to rescue your fallen friend afterward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597361-repo3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597361-repo3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597361"></a><figcaption>But doctor...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597361-repo3.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Clown">Clown</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 60 to 100, depending on the attack</li></ul><p>The Clown isn't a regular monster.

Sadly, hiding underneath an object isn't an option, as they'll use the skull on one of their tentacles to attack you. Thankfully, all that armor makes them quite slow, so escaping is fairly easy if there's enough distance between you two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597356-20251030231743_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597356" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597356-20251030231743_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597356"></a><figcaption>I guess we aren't making that quota after all.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597356-20251030231743_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Robe">Robe</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 50 to 100, depending on whether they're crouched or standing</li></ul><p>The Robe is an expert in sneaking up on players in REPO, as proven by the screenshot above. The best way to avoid them is to make a run for it while avoiding direct eye contact, as the latter will empower them and make them faster. Unless you have a ton of strength or, better yet, a weapon, the best course of action is to simply run away.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597378" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597378"></a><figcaption>The Huntsman's behavior is quite distinct compared to the rest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4597378-20251030234328_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Huntsman">Huntsman</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger level</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>HP</strong>: 250</li><li><strong>Attack</strong>: 100</li></ul><p>The Huntsman is unable to see, which means they will try to pick up sounds instead.

If you see floating hands on each side of your screen, it means the Loom is nearby, and you're now their target. From that moment on, they'll start a slow chase. If you've seen the movie It Follows, you know what to do--keep on moving until you're face. Of course, there's a chance that they'll start chasing you again. If caught, they'll clap their hands with you in the center of them.</p><p>Those are all the monsters available in REPO thus far. Best of luck meeting your quota!</p>

            <p>Things are moving forward with the live-action Legend of Zelda film, which has now started production.</p>
<p>That's according to a listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/">Film &amp; Television Industry Alliance</a> website, which states filming for Nintendo's Legend of Zelda adaptation would begin on 4th November 2025 - so, two days ago - and run until April next year.</p>

<p>If this is accurate, this should mean we could hear more casting news in the near future. This in turn will allow us to piece together which of the games in the Zelda series the film team is adapting. If Sidon pops up, we know we are in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> territory, for example. Perhaps we will get some kind of teaser for the series' 40th anniversary, which is early next year.</p>
<p>According to the website, filming for the Legend of Zelda film is taking place in Wellington, New Zealand. This is a popular filming location, with the likes of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films all heading to Wellington for some cinematic shots. Wellington's Kaitoke Regional Park, for example, became Rivendell. Wētā Workshop is also based in Wellington. </p><p>Meanwhile, the Legend of Zelda project summary reads thus: "A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. 'The Legend of Zelda' follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce - an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a> in the upcoming adaptation, which is currently set for a release in 2027.</p>

Set before the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, this is a Legend of Zelda crossover with Koei Tecmo's Warriors franchise.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Alex has already had a shot with Age of Imprisonment</a>, calling it Warriors' "richest offering yet".</p>

            <p>
As part to today's big Pokémon blow-out, Nintendo has confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>'s Mega Dimension DLC is launching for Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> on 10th December. Additionally, a new side-mission is available today.
</p>
<p>
We knew Mega Dimension was coming even before Z-A's release, and Nintendo's even talked about it fairly extensively too. But the gist is it adds a bunch of newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose. How? The answer, apparently, is "hyperspace".
</p>
<p>
For whatever reason, spatial distortions are beginning to form around the city, creating a sort of alternate plane of reality known as Hyperspce Lumiose. Here, players go on an adventure guided by doughnut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, that'll introduce them to those aforementioned new Pokémon and mega-evolutions - some of which can exceed the normal limit of Lv. 100 with hyperspace levels.

<p>
"Hoopa's powers are awakened when it receives one of Ansha's donuts," Nintendo explains in its release date announcement, "transforming the distortions into portals to hyperspace. Ansha uses Berries to create various kinds of donuts that grant different effects in hyperspace, such as powering up your Pokémon. She can also use more potent Hyperspace Berries, which are useful for taking on the high-level Pokémon in Hyperspace Lumiose."
</p>

<p>
And if you're wondering which Pokémon are getting new Mega-Evolved forms as part of Z-A's DLC, both Mega Chimecho and Mega Baxcalibur are now confirmed. The former can make six smaller copies of itself - and their overlapping, resonating echoes create an "intense sound-wave attack that can overwhelm any opponent". Baxcalibur's Mega Evolution, meanwhile, sees them generating a massive back blade out of ice energy, which can cleave or smash nearly anything in its path. The Mega Stone needed to evolve Baxcalibur is acquired through the Z-A Battle Club by advancing in online Ranked Battles. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell previously did a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-closest-thing-well-ever-get-to-the-mysterious-long-forgotten-gorochu-is-coming-to-pokemon-legends-z-a-but-youll-need-the-paid-dlc">pretty deep dive on some of the other additions coming to Mega Dimension</a> if you're curious to learn more.
</p><p>
It's potentially exciting stuff, then, but it's certainly not cheap. <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/pokemon-legends-z-a-70010000094235">Pokémon Legends: Z-A's Mega Dimension costs £24.99</a> - half of cost of the base Switch 1 game - over on eShop. And speaking of the base game, players can claim a Diancite Stone through the Mystery Gift feature from today. By taking the stone to the Looker Bureau, it's possible to unlock the new 'Shine Bright like a Gemstone' side mission, and a chance to catch the Jewel Pokémon Diancie.

<p>Get your very own Diancie</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>While today's headline news might be the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC getting a release date, there's another neat announcement tucked in all of the Mega madness.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has announced a brand new Mystery Gift event, which is available in-game now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. Accessing this will unlock a brand new Side Mission in-game — <strong>Shine Bright like a Gemstone</strong> — which will reward you with your very own Diancie and Diancite, a Mega Stone that unlocks a brand new Mega Evolution for the Rock/Fairy-type.</p>
<p>All you need to do to access this gift is roll credits. You don't need to buy the DLC either! Easy, right? And from the looks of things, the event will be live... forever? No end date has been revealed, at least, so you've got time!</p>

<p>Diancie was introduced in Generation VI, first appearing in Pokémon X &amp; Y as part of a special event. It's a Mythical Pokémon, and pretty powerful as a result.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate, the 2D-action platformer from developer Bitmap Bureau Ltd. and publisher Reef Entertainment, has been delayed for a third time, though thankfully, players who've been anticipating this old-school take on Terminator will still be able to play it on PC and console platforms before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>It was initially set to arrive on September 5, 2025, though ahead of that launch, it was pushed to October. After that, it was pushed to November 26, 2025, and twenty days ahead of that release date, it was pushed again to its current, and hopefully final release date, December 12, 2025.</p>



<p>"<em>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you</em>," publisher Reef Entertainment began <a href="https://x.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467">in a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> announcing the third (and hopefully final) delay for Terminator 2D: No Fate. "<em>We know you've waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey</em>."</p>



<p>This delay is, unfortunately, once again caused by issues Reef Entertainment has had with regard to the physical editions of the game. Before, the issue was tariff and trade-based, with the different components needed for the physical editions. Now that it has all that sorted, it needs to put the physical editions together.</p>



<p>"<em>The physical components for all editions have now finally arrived, following the ongoing delays that pushed us off our previous schedules. However, we now have to assemble the physical editions,</em> <em>which we need some time to do. Because of this, we are moving the launch date of Terminator 2D: No Fate to December 12, 2025, for all physical and digital versions of the game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We are sincerely sorry for the repeated delays. We don't take your patience for granted, and we never want to disappoint our community. Our goal has always been to deliver the game that you deserve, and we're almost there</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>First of all, we want to start by saying thank you. We know you’ve waited longer than expected for the release of Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we truly appreciate your patience and support throughout this journey.</p><p>The physical components for all editions have now…</p></div>— Reef Entertainment (@Reef_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1986003116022493467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate that players are left waiting a little longer, but delaying the game not for issues with the game itself, but for issues with the physical release, is commendable because it speaks to the publisher wanting everyone who is going to grab Terminator 2D: No Fate at launch, whether they're buying the physical edition or digital version, the same day-one experience. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>At least it's still arriving before the end of the year, and Termiantor fans will have something to play while they wait for Terminator: Survivors, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">still has no release date despite being given a 2025 release window in August 2024</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Sales Fall After Quiet Six Months]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-sales-fall-after-quiet-six-months.1345624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, and sales and profits are down, driven largely by a fairly quiet six-month period with very few major releases.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/26q2release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> outlining its latest financial results, Square Enix reveals that sales are down by 15% when compared to the same six-month period last year, while operating income has fallen by 28.8%.</p>

<p>The company puts this disparity down to new games generating "lower sales than releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam" rel="nofollow">three&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>catalog titles on Steam</a>...the previous year". Despite that, Square Enix says its video games business "returned to profitability" this year, largely thanks to expense-related technicalities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=Zda3A23j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-square-enix-financials-q1-2-2025-26.jpg?itok=LSikqHw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts</em>' Steam debut means the first six months of last year were better for Square Enix than this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix's MMORPG segment also declined, again largely due to the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>last year. It might <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-inconsistent-vacation" rel="nofollow">not have offered the game's best story</a>, but it sure did boost Square Enix's business.</p>

<p>In fairness to Square Enix, it has been a pretty quiet six months for the publisher. In the six-month period ending on September 30th, Square Enix's catalog consists entirely of ports, including&nbsp;a Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default&nbsp;</em>and the Xbox Series X|S release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>.</p>

<p>As we know,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xvi-sales-3-5m" rel="nofollow">wasn't exactly a major money-spinner</a> for Square Enix the first time around, so its arrival on a console that's struggling to keep up with its peers probably wasn't going to set the publisher's coffers alight.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, however, things look a touch rosier for Square Enix.&nbsp;Remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games arrived in late October, and that's a series that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-2024-25" rel="nofollow">tends to do pretty well</a> for the company. A remake of the seventh game in the series is also due to arrive in February.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shut-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-shuts-down-ex-ubisoft-producers-bad-brain-studios.1345621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has closed down yet another of its studios before its first release, and this time, it's the turn of Bad Brain Game Studios, which was helmed by ex-Ubisoft producer Sean Crooks.</p>

<p>Announcing the shutdown on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Bad Brain, which was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">established back in 2023</a>, says that its last day of operation will be November 17th, and that while the studio is trying to find a new partner for its debut project, it has not yet managed to do so.</p>

<p>Bad Brain says that its game and the associated IP are both "still available for acquisition or partnership", and that the studio, as well as parent NetEase, is "open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=VAGB9xzb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bad-brain-game-studios-netease-shutdown-project.jpg?itok=k9ZNdMvt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Brain Game Studios was working on its debut project when it was shut down by NetEase.</figcaption></figure><p>To the end of helping former Bad Brain staffers find work, the studio also posted a sizzle reel of its in-development project alongside the LinkedIn post announcing its closure. The game, according to Bad Brain, was met with an "enthusiastic response" by peers and industry insiders.</p>

<p>From the looks of the sizzle reel,&nbsp;the untitled game would have been a third-person action-adventure game inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>and Rockstar's&nbsp;<em>Bully</em>, juxtaposing ordinary 80s life with delving into spooky locations to do battle with creepy-crawlies.</p>

<p>Bad Brain is the latest in a string of NetEase-backed studios to lose their funding or close down in recent months. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">T-Minus Zero Entertainment</a>, which was founded by ex-BioWare vet Rich Vogel, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">Worlds Untold</a>, another ex-BioWare staffer's studio.</p>

<p>It's not just studios that haven't released games, either. In February, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">closed down the development outfit</a> responsible for the hugely successful&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so it seems that nobody is safe.</p>




<p>These shutdowns are taking place against the backdrop of an industry riven with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-entertainment-ubisoft-layoffs" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avalanche-studios-layoffs-uk-closure" rel="nofollow">closures</a>, and there's no sign of the deluge ending anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>' first proper patch, assuming you're a member of the honourable sect who don't count <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/776434170343719695?l=english">hotfixes</a> as patches, has arrived. It's relatively small, but it does set up three new map conditions that'll be unleashed in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> this weekend, as well as fixing some pesky bugs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">notes</a>, the three new map conditions set to unlock this weekend are what looks to be a night raid variant of Blue Gate, as well as the more mysterious "hidden bunker" and "electromagnetic storm". Here's hoping the last two might be on the same map, given the former sounds like useful shelter from the latter.</p>
<p>Beyond that, it's bug fix city. The integrated shield recharger only recharging when it's equipped, Augment skills not working all, and health regen skills not working if activated while you're down but not out have all been dealt with. Perhaps the most fun mole that's been whacked is an exploit that was seeing deployables push players through walls.</p>
<p>Embark have also made zipline exit points barricade-free zones and ensured the Well-Travelled achievement triggers as planned. Finally, they've added both "a charge progress for integrated shield repair" and the punch hands pre-order bonus emote.</p>

<p>"Arc Raiders wants to be one of your 'forever' games: it already has a roadmap for the rest of the year that includes a new map as well as new Arc enemies, items, and quests," reads the latter's verdict. "Its long-term strength will rely on the quality of those updates. I'm not yet deep enough to know whether Arc Raiders will feel this compelling at hour 100 or whether, in two months' time, I'll still be dreaming about it. For now, all I know is that its metallic hooks are in me, and I cannot stop playing."</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="175">You really can never have too much storage space on your PC — especially a gaming PC. Luckily, Samsung’s making it easy to seriously upgrade your setup with this killer deal on its premium gaming SSD. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus comes in three sizes — 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB — and almost all of them are on sale right now: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">1TB model is down 19%, dropping from $104 to just $84</a>. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/">2TB version is discounted 15%, now $149 instead of $177</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5372/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="175">This SSD has both space and speed. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus delivers read speeds up to 7,250 MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300 MB/s, so your games and apps will load faster than you can Google, “What’s taking so long?” Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, or working with high-res photos in Photoshop, this drive keeps things running with smooth performance.</p>

<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">Samsung also makes it easy to keep your drive in top shape. With the free Magician Software, you can monitor your SSD’s health, install updates, and make sure it’s always running at its best.</p>
<h2>PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">And if you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, this SSD can give your console a big storage boost too. The PS5 only has 1TB of internal space, but you actually get just over 800GB of usable storage since the system software need to take its share. With games ballooning in size year after year, we’ve got AAA title well into the triple digits of gigabytes needed. If you limit yourself to the base internal storage, you can really only limit yourself to a handful of games before you need to cleanup your storage and delete the old stuff.</p>


<p data-start="1125" data-end="1602">To expand your PS5 storage, you’ll need an SSD with at least 5,500 MB/s read speed, and the 990 EVO Plus fits the bill. Just remember though you’ll need a heatsink to go with it. This is just a small metal casing that helps keep the SSD cool while gaming. You can pick them one up for roughly $10 to $20.</p>
<p data-start="1604" data-end="1801">For a limited time, you can upgrade your PC or console storage by 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB, and save up to 19% on the Samsung 990 EVO Plus — starting at just $84. That’s a small price to pay to never need to worry about managing your PC or PS5 game storage again.</p>

              <p>Early next year, the 21-year-old MMO&nbsp;<em>World of Warcraft</em> is releasing its 11th expansion, <em>Midnight</em>. Alongside new zones in the Blood Elf homelands, player housing, and a wealth of new content, the expansion is also going to see yet another revision of the game’s UI, focused on implementing the features most players currently have to mod in. And this has caused people to suggest such streamlining could be part of preparing <em>WoW</em> for its debut on consoles. However, according to director Ion Hazzikostas, that’s absolutely not happening.</p> <p>“If we were actively working towards bringing <em>WoW</em> to consoles or a bunch of other platforms,” says the game’s current lead, “we’d be saying, ‘We’re actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it’s a place where we want to land.'” Speaking to t<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4">he Unshackled Fury podcast</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em></a>), Hazzikostas said if it were really in the works, Blizzard would just say so. “To be fully transparent, there’s no reason for us to hide anything about this,” he said.</p>

  <p>There was once a time where the MMO’s only feasible home was the PC. While there were exceptions, like the Dreamcast-only <em>Phantasy Star Online</em>, for the majority of massively multiplayer online RPGs lived on home computers. But not any more. However, that’s now all changed. As consoles have become PCs in boxes, and controllers now offer eighty-million buttons, it’s the norm for any new MMO to appear on Xbox and PlayStation alongside PC. Titles like&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Throne and Liberty&nbsp;</em>thrive on consoles, and while the genre is certainly not even a fraction as popular as it once was, it’d be a foolish developer not to release a new one cross-platform. Which all makes it so extraordinary that Blizzard is still not even considering porting <em>World of Warcraft</em> outside of the PC.</p>

 <p>It’s even more peculiar when you remember that the consolidation of so much of the games industry in recent years means that Microsoft now owns Blizzard (a fact that’s weirdly easy to forget, given how Blizzard has always operated so independently, for good and for ill). You would think that the megacorp would rather appreciate&nbsp;<em>WoW</em> on Xbox, especially with the potential for a Game Pass version that’s provocatively lacking the very many paid-for expansions.</p> <p>Still, while Hazzikostas’ frank words seem very final, it’s impossible to believe that the conversation isn’t happening. It would be frankly weird if the follow-up to the Xbox Series couldn’t just directly hook up to Battle.net, and it certainly wouldn’t do any harm of the MMO already had a controller-friendly UI in place. However, what we appear to know for sure is that this isn’t something that’s happening imminently, no matter how much it would appear to make sense.</p> <p>For PC players, however, <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24245100">the beta test for&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> begins November 11</a>.</p>

              <p>There isn’t anything quite like a fresh cup of coffee to start your day. And then a fresh cup of coffee to continue your day right after lunch. Oh and what about a fresh cup of coffee with dessert. Then ya gotta have a nice decaf right before bed. Or maybe go with a full espresso shot, I won’t tell anyone. Then if you manage to sleep, you can wake up and have another fresh cup of coffee to start your day and do it all over again.</p>
<p>If you’re a coffee aficionado, you know a simple single-serve pod coffee maker like a Keurig just won’t cut it. You’re very particular about how you like your coffee and you need a machine that can brew exactly to your liking, every time. Ahead of Black Friday, Amazon has the famous Breville Barista Express on sale for 21% off. It’s normally <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/">sold at $699, so the discount ends up saving you a whole $150: You end up only having to pay $549 for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5371/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brew It How You Like It</h2>
<p>You can make yourself the finest cup of coffee brewed perfectly how you like it thanks to the Breville Barista Express’ integrated precision conical burr grinder with 16 precision grind settings. It grinds coffee beans on demand to the exact right amount needed for your selected roast of bean and personal preferences. It’s an easy enough espresso machine to operate as it give you precise control over grind size regardless of the bean you use.</p>



<p>This Breville coffee maker heats up the coffee with the help of a thermocoil heating system. This gives you complete control over the water temperature, thereby making a cup of coffee with a much more balanced flavor. When it starts, the machine gradually bumps up pressure which can help to draw out the coffee’s flavors evenly as it extracts. What you’re left with is a damn cup of coffee that Dale Cooper himself would compliment.</p>
<p>The powerful steam wand let’s you make silky smooth microfoam from added milk to complete you latte. Before you know it, you’ll be pouring perfect latte leaves in every cup.</p>
<p>The Breville Barista Express measures in at 15.9 inches high by 12.5 inches wide and 13.8 inches deep.

<p>Choose between either a brushed stainless steel or the refined black sesame finish. Both are currently on sale for the reduced price of $550 for a limited time.</p>

In a new trailer released today, developer Game Freak has revealed Mega Dimension will launch on December 10, and it will feature a new Hyperspace Lumiose to explore, Pokémon exceeding Level 100, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Mega Dimension DLC, trainers will revisit Lumiose as spatial distortions begin to form around the city, according to a press release from Nintendo. "Donut chef Ansha and her companion, the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa, will guide players as they explore the mysterious dimension known as Hyperspace Lumiose," the press release continues. "This not-quite Lumiose City is home to newly discovered Mega-Evolved Pokémon and other Pokémon not usually found in Lumiose, some of which can exceed the normal limit of Level 100 with hyperspace levels."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DHozr0ZBcE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DHozr0ZBcE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Nintendo says Hoopa's powers are awakened after it receives one of Ansha's donuts (must be an amazing donut), transforming the distortions around Lumiose into portals to Hyperspace Lumiose. Those portals are how trainers will reach this new area, and once there, Ansha can use berries to create new kinds of donuts that grant unique effects in Hyperspace. She can even use Hyperspace Berries needed for taking on the high-level Pokémon of Hyperspace.&nbsp;</p><p>"Trainers will be joined by new allies such as Korrina, a successor to a line of Mega Evolution gurus determined to encounter every Mega-Evolved Pokémon," according to the press release. "Together with Team MZ, players will explore Hyperspace Lumiose, uncover its secrets, and tackle the strange events befalling Lumiose City."&nbsp;</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> wants 70% of its QA work to be handled by generative AI by the end of 2027, in partnership with the University of Tokyo's Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">in a progress report for last year's Mid-Term Business Plan</a>, the company notes its reason for doing so, the hope that: "through the use of automation technology, aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development."</p>
<p>This collaboration between Square Enix and the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory comes in the form of a research team with more than ten members, filled with both researchers from the Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory, as well as engineers from Square Enix.</p>

<p>The Matsuo-Iwasawa Laboratory is a dedicated department of the University of Tokyo which focuses on new technology. It states<a href="https://weblab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/"> on its official website</a> a desire to "create an ecosystem that is equivalent to Silicon Valley".</p>
<p>Square Enix has stated that within a year since the initiation of its Mid-Term Business Plan, the company has been "promoting AI utilization in Japan", as part of its goal to "Roll out initiatives to create additional foundational stability".</p>
<p>Back in February, Square Enix already announced it was using AI during game development, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/21034-square-enix-co-ltd-azure-ai-search">specifically Azure Open AI</a>.

		<p>Permafrost will be coming to Steam Early Access in 2026, SpaceRocket Games has announced today, but a playtest will be taking place ahead of the early access release. You can register for the Permafrost playtest now via the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254990/Permafrost/">Steam page</a>. Along with the early access announcement, a new trailer for Permafrost has been released showing various elements of gameplay including base building, hunting, and co-operative play.</p>
<p><iframe title="Permafrost | &quot;Until The World Ends&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SCZgnFDj44s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, the development team said, <em>“First of all, thank you for your support and patience throughout the last year. Your dedication to providing critical feedback, suggestions, bug reports and technical troubleshooting during our demo was a literal game changer. With your help, we have been able to lock in the vision for our Early Access release – we have been in the icy trenches since – focusing on improving the core elements of the game, including stability, performance, and key gameplay foundations. So, this brings us to the release date. Permafrost will release into Early Access in 2026. We want to bring the best possible Early Access release build to you – one that’s not rushed, but rather polished and with a solid foundation, built with your feedback, reports, and requests. In other words, it’s for the best. We know it sucks to wait, but hang in there and let the devs cook, it will be worth it.”</em></p>
<p>Permafrost takes place in a world where the moon shattered and Earth plunged into a never-ending ice age. Among this icy world, players will need to find scarce resources, hunt for food, and work with each other to survive the wintry landscape. The game supports four player co-op but there may be clashes with groups that are not your own. The cold will be an ever present danger to all players, so building shelters will be necessary to survive. The development team will be releasing a deep dive on Permafrost next week to delve more into the game’s systems.</p>

<p>As revealed in today's trailer drop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension</a> DLC will arrive on Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>10th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The story DLC sees you and Team MZ investigating mysterious distortions that have been cropping up across Lumiose City, connected to the strange land of 'Hyperspace Lumiose'.</p>
<p>Here's the official summary from the new trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just when Team MZ’s efforts seem to have restored peace to Lumiose City, something strange begins to happen—mysterious distortions start forming all around town. You’ll also meet a mysterious young girl named Ansha, who is accompanied by the Mischief Pokémon, Hoopa.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We can expect new Mega Evolutions (Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y take pride of place on the key art), plenty of Hoopa content, and more than a little eerily-silent dialogue from you and your MZ pals. Hey, at least the dimension-hopping looks interesting enough.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of those new Mega forms for Baxcalibur, Chimecho, Diancie and Meganium:</p>

<p>As a reminder, the DLC will set you back <strong>£24.99 / $29.99</strong>, and it is now available to buy on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Pokemon-Legends-Z-A-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2827849.html#DLC">Switch eShop</a>.</p>

<p>Well here's a dish that we weren't expecting! Team17 and Ghost Town Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/overcooked-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Overcooked 2! - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> is being served up today!</p>
<p>As initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">September Direct</a>, this is the same old co-op cooking chaos that we all know and love, garnished with some new features to make the most of the beefed-up system.</p>
<p>We've got 4k 60fps gameplay in docked mode, we've got camera integration so everyone's screaming faces can appear on screen, we've got GameShare for playing with pals on one copy of the game, heck, there's even a new chef: The Pristine Platinum Platypus.</p>
<p>A pretty balanced meal, no? Well, it won't arrive for free. Those with the Switch 1 version of the game will be able to upgrade for <strong>£7.99 / €9.99 / $9.99</strong>, or you can pick up the full Switch 2 Edition for <strong>£24.99 / €29.99 / $29.99</strong> on the eShop. There is a 20% discount running on the storefront for one week only, so you can sneak in and grab an early bird offer if you want to plate up soon.</p>

<p>And for all those wondering, yes, there is cross-progression for this release, so all of your precious DLC and save data can be transferred over to the new edition without any troubles — nobody wants to see those three-star runs go to waste.</p>
<p>A spot of Overcooked can be a dangerous game over the holiday season, but with the right chefs in the kitchen, we're ready to head back in for another good old giggle.</p>
