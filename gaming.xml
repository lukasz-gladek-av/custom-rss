            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-switch-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct presentation that's set to bring some more information about upcoming Switch titles tomorrow, but you should temper your expectations.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> on social media platform X, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will take place at 7am Pacific (that's 10am Eastern and 2pm GMT), and will feature "around 30 minutes" of info about "upcoming games for Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>However, Nintendo swiftly clarifies that there won't be any information about the Switch 2 during tomorrow's Direct. If you want that, you'll have to tune in to the Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">that will air next Wednesday</a>&nbsp;at 6am Pacific (and thanks to time zone shenanigans, that will also be around 2pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=cLYZaWsX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=AtGCiPhN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get more&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>info during tomorrow's Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>As for what games we're likely to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct, there's a decent chance we'll be learning more about&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">unveiled in full</a> during Nintendo's summer gaming show last year.</p>

<p>We still don't have a specific release date beyond (no pun intended) 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, so hopefully, we'll get to learn exactly when we can play Samus' latest adventure. Of course, there's also a chance we'll learn it's coming to Switch 2 as well during next week's show.</p>

<p>A release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem especially likely given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">how recent its first gameplay reveal was</a>, but hey, I can't deny it's on my wishlist, so let's hope we get some more info about that one too.</p>

<p>Obviously, no gaming show, whether it's a Nintendo Direct, a State of Play, or an Xbox Developer Direct, is complete without a mention of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>. Will we get a release date for that tomorrow? It's highly unlikely, but a man can dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/635890/no-mans-sky-relics-update-archaeology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-webster">Andrew Webster</a> <span>is an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The latest update for <em>No Man’s Sky</em> is going back in time. Called <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/">Relics</a>, the expansion launches today and introduces paleontology and archaeology elements to the sci-fi exploration game; players can now unearth the bones of alien creatures, piece them together, and even erect museums.</p><p>Perhaps most interesting is that players will be able to assemble the ancient creatures however they’d like. Here’s how developer Hello Games explains it:</p><div><blockquote><p>There is a truly huge variety of procedural prehistoric bones, in all shapes and sizes, to excavate and collect. It’s up to you how you reassemble them and there’s a lot of fun to be had building ever-more outrageous skeletons to put on display in your bases-turned-museums or share with your fellow Travellers.</p><p>Fossils out there to be discovered vary hugely in rarity, so you never quite know what you’re going to unearth. There’s a real buzz when you find something truly rare. The most uncommon finds hold huge value. For those trying desperately to finish their collection, we introduced a specialist who can be bartered with at the Space Station.</p></blockquote></div><p>Naturally, since this is <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, there’s also an element of danger. Certain bones and underground treasures will be guarded by golem-like creatures and a giant new type of worm.</p><div><p>As with all of the game’s major updates, Relics is free to download, and it joins an increasingly massive list of new content for the game since its launch in 2016. Most recently, that has included <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1">big changes to the game’s graphics</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/599537/no-mans-sky-worlds-2-update">the addition of trillions of new planets</a>, and just as important: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24234948/no-mans-fly-fishing">fishing</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite might have another Dragon Ball collaboration in the works, and this time, it’s with the latest Daima series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As revealed by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1904609271561805956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Loolo_WRLD</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-reportedly-getting-dragon-ball-daima-skins-collaboration-crossover-item-shop-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), “an ID related to a new Dragon Ball wave” has been spotted in the Fortnite files, and it seems it could hint at new Daima skins. Reliable leaker Spheshal_Nick has added more information, stating that he has also recently heard about this collaboration. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Daima is the latest addition to the popular anime franchise, and players would love to see characters from the series come to Fortnite Island. Daima features some of the most hyped characters of the series, such as Vegeta Super Saiyan 3 and Goku Super Saiyan 4. It also has new fan-favourite characters like Glorio, the Tamagamis, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite has already collaborated with Dragon Ball in the past, with skins for Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Beerus, Goku Black, Piccolo, Cell, Bulma, Trunks, Android 17, Android 18 and Frieza present in the game. These characters also come with their own set of accessories and emotes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the cosmetics, Fortnite also had notable additions to gameplay for the Dragon Ball collaborations, including the Kamehameha and Nimbus Cloud (Kintoun) items in Battle Royale. They had also introduced a Dragon Ball Adventure Island where players could explore iconic locations from the series. It will be interesting to see if Fortnite receives additional themed gameplay for the alleged Daima collab.&nbsp;</p>

We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2"><u>The Last of Us 2</u></a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion," too, which has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This whole religion takes place on this one planet, and then at one point, all communication stops," Druckmann teased. "And you're playing a bounty hunter that's chasing her bounty, and she crash lands on this planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So many of the previous games we've done, there's always, like, an ally with you," he said. "I really want you to be lost in a place that you're really confused about what happened here, who are the people here, what was their history. And in order to get off this planet — again, no one has been heard from this planet for 600 years or so — if you ever have hoped to have a chance to get off, you have to figure out what happened here."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assuming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet releases in 2027, and taking into account Druckmann’s comment about it being in development for four years so far, by the time the game comes out it will have been in the works for six years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pretty long wait, but speaking to IGN on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, Druckmann said that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is not only playable right now, but “really good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will say we are playing it at the office and it's incredible,” Druckmann teased. “It's really good.

                <p dir="ltr">InZoi is set to launch in early access tomorrow, and developer InZoi Studio is hoping its Sims-like life simulator can challenge EA's juggernaut right from the jump. After a controversy stirred regarding mods, however, one lead dev took to Steam to announce the removal of the DRM program Denuvo from the upcoming build, in a bid to quell disappointment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353752633?l=english" rel="nofollow ">statement on InZoi's official Steam page</a>, game director and producer Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim confirmed that Denuvo will not be part of InZoi's early-access launch after "consulting with teams from around the world to make a thoughtful and informed decision." Kim says that the decision to use Denuvo was initially to prevent "illegal distribution," but that including the program would ultimately not serve the community at large.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832"></a><figcaption>InZoi</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We understand that removing Denuvo increases the risk of the game being cracked and illegally distributed after release," Kim said in the statement. "At the same time, we believe it opens up a valuable opportunity: It allows InZoi to become more freely configurable--unlocking new ways for players to shape new experiences for other players. We believe enabling this freedom from the very beginning will lead to innovative and long-lasting enjoyment for the community."</p><p dir="ltr">Kim also apologized to the community for the controversy, saying they "regret the concern and confusion this has caused within the community, and we’re committed to rebuilding your trust as we move forward in developing the best possible experience." He also reiterated that the team is "committed to making InZoi a highly moddable game."</p><p dir="ltr">The change in direction comes after a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2456740/discussions/0/599648005874810809/">Steam community forum post</a> mentioned that mods for InZoi would only allow for cosmetic mods--skins, clothing, etc. Specifically, the game's terms of service said that "certain content provided by the Company includes elements that you are not permitted to modify or alter at your discretion" and that players are "prohibited from making any modifications, whether in whole or in part, to such content."</p><p>InZoi launches in early access March 27 on Steam. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/">InZoi Online Showcase livestream</a> aired last week, which showed the team's initial plans for the game, including a full roadmap of what's to expect in the coming weeks.</p>

I played Red Dead Redemption 2, and I lived in it," he told <a href="https://comicbook.com/interviews/news/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-gaming-history-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "It was not a game. It was like a way of life. I got 400 hours clocked, and it was a lot, and I don't regret any of it. It was so fun. It's beautiful out there, it's an incredible universe they created."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1EtVPBSMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8B1EtVPBSMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is just the latest video game film for Black, as he also played Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. In video games themselves, Black is perhaps best known for portraying Eddie Riggs in Brutal Legend.</p><p>Black appeared in the interview alongside his A Minecraft Movie co-star Jason Momoa, who said he had never heard of Red Dead Redemption 2; this elicited a shocked response from Black.</p><p>"Dude, you never heard of Rockstar Games? These guys are the artists. You have to play it; it'll change your life. If you play one game, that's the one," he said.</p><p>Asked about his own favorite games, Momoa said he chooses to generally "stay away" from games due to what he said was a "pretty addictive personality." He did say he enjoyed Capcom's popular Street Fighter series, saying Ryu and Blanka are his two favorite characters.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie releases in theaters on April 4. It's been a long time coming, as the film has been in the works for more than a decade, bouncing between directors like Rob McElhenney and Shawn Levy before finally finding Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess. In addition to Black and Momoa, the film stars Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen.</p><p>It's not the only video game movie coming in April, as Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/" data-ref-id="1100-6528665">Until Dawn film arrives on April 25</a>.

            <p>Nintendo will be hosting a Nintendo Direct presentation tomorrow, 27th March.</p>
<p>This Direct will focus on upcoming games for the original Nintendo Switch, and last for around half an hour.</p>

<p>Again, this Direct will be focused on the OG Switch, and Nintendo has tempered expectations ahead of time. "There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation," the announcement post reads.</p>
<p>For those interested in tuning in, kick off will be at 2pm UK time. We here at Eurogamer will of course be watching along and keeping you abreast of the news as it happens. What are you hoping to see there?</p>

<p>Tomorrow's presentation comes ahead of a dedicated Switch 2 Direct, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">which is scheduled for 2nd April</a>.</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch successor was officially revealed back in January after plenty of rumours and speculation</a>, Nintendo has still kept most details under wraps. This will change next week, though, with the upcoming showcase promising "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2".</p>
<p>While that wording is still quite vague, from the earlier Switch 2 reveal we can presume we will hear more about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Joy-Con's apparent mouse functionality</a>, and maybe even discover what exactly that mysterious button on the right-hand Joy-Con does.</p>
<p>We should also hear more about the games that will be heading to Switch 2. The console's announcement teaser did give us a brief <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">glimpse of a new Mario Kart title</a>, complete with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">fresh looking Donkey Kong</a>, but I am still hoping for more on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to April's Direct, Nintendo has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-switch-2-public-hands-on-tour">confirmed it'll be holding a Switch 2 "world tour"</a> event, giving the public an opportunity to go hands-on with the console and, presumably, its launch line-up of games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In August last year, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">would be ending service that October</a>, and now it's the turn of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>-inspired strategy RPG spinoff to do the same, according to a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new announcement</a> on the game's official website.</p>

<p>According to Square Enix, while the studio attempted to "provide an enjoyable gaming experience" for&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>' players, it's become "difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience", hence the game's impending shutdown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=GHBnxXib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=eU648NzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, it's no longer possible to purchase&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>' Visiore currency from the game's shop, nor can you make any more Special Shop purchases.</p>

<p>Service will fully shut down on May 29th at 11:59PM Pacific, so you'll have until then to do whatever you need to do in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions&nbsp;</em>before the game disappears forever. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to play any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a>, either.</p>

<p>If you've got Google Play Points you want to exchange for items in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>, you'll be able to do so until April 30th, but any Visiore you've already got can be used right up until the game's service comes to an end.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar,&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG spinoff of mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>. It combines the strategic gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>' gacha mechanics and general free-to-play mobile trappings.</p>




<p>During its operation, the game crossed over with several major&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>titles, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-reveals-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy V</em>.</p>

<p>You can still check out&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-be-wotv/id1484937345" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be available until May 29th (or May 30th, depending on your time zone).</p>

Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is the tale of an alternate timeline in which the Nazis got hold of mechs and promptly overran the British Isles. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grit-and-valor-1949-is-a-real-time-into-the-breach-or-at-least-vaguely-similar-enough-that-i-can-squeeze-a-more-popular-game-in-this-headline">semi-alluded</a> last year, you could summarise the game itself as the product of a timeline in which the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> decided to make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a> instead. Except that it isn’t quite as deviously made, based on the demo, and it isn’t turn-based. Ah, I do kind of wish it was turn-based.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Everything else here works for me, just about: the rustpunk stompiness of the mechs themselves; the rock-Patlabor-scissors relationships between those mechs and other units, spliced with questions of elevation and cover; the grid-based, rotating maps floating against sepia voids, with waves of fascist scum arriving by chopper; the chunky graphic novel storytelling and kaiju-grade bosses. I just wish it wasn’t a real-time game. Still, that’s an opening impression and in fairness, you <em>can</em> issue unit orders while paused. Indeed, it’s generally better to when you’re aiming special abilities that have a cooldown. Perhaps it's secretly a turn-based game, then? Here’s a trailer.

<p>
The plot here is that you’re fighting your way from Scotland to Berlin to detonate an EMP and silence those goose-stepping Gundamns for good. The campaign unfolds across a node-based map, with certain branches taking you to riskier, more rewarding or easier, less lucrative encounters. During each mission, you’ll need to keep your HQ truck alive while weighing the risks of going after optional objectives, like signal towers that take ages to capture, leaving your mechs exposed in the process. There are also paradropped supply crates that bestow a choice of power-ups, such as repairing this or that mech.
</p>
<p>
The maps are pleasingly cramped. Pleasingly for me, anyway. It feels like you’re presiding over a clash between rival antfarms. RTS fans may yearn for more elbow room. I do wonder if Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is angling for commute-friendly snackability, which makes its lack of Steam Deck verification a bit concerning. Still, I enjoy the aesthetics here, and I could imagine the fundamentals supporting some denser tactical puzzles as the campaign wears on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911860/Grit_and_Valor__1949/">Read more on Steam</a>.

<p>Nintendo has confirmed its next Nintendo Direct event will take place on Thursday, March 27 at 10am ET/7am PT. The announcement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">days after rumors</a> began of an event happening this week.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1904896350853960065?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> announcing the event, this Nintendo Direct will feature “around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch”. What it wont include, however, is anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The company is, instead, choosing to keep all of that under wraps until the new console’s Direct on April 2. </p>



<p>As far as what games to expect, there are questions regarding the state of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. According to a new claim, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be present</a> at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. That has lead many to wonder if it will be shown at this current-generation Direct or kept off until a later date.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming learned of Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for game launches</a> around the Nintendo Switch 2. According to sources, the company is set to release its launch window games in three waves.</p>



<p>Thursday’s Nintendo Direct will air on the company’s YouTube channels and in the video player below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-a-jump-button/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker Khazan follows the typical conventions of many contemporary Soulslikes. It has a plethora of intimidating bosses and looks to jump you at every opportunity. But let’s see if Khazan has one of the most basic controls—a jump button. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is happy for you to die over and over. This is why I would consider the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-difficulty-settings-easy-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty settings</a> if you haven’t already. It’s also happy to thrust you into multi-mob ambushes and test your patience. But it also has elements of traversal and exploration. </p>



<p>You’ll come across various paths and routes in The First Berserker Khazan. So much so it’ll leave you wondering if Khazan has a jump button, and we have the answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-jump-button-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Is There a Jump Button in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We tried it, so you don’t have to. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does not have a dedicated jump button, meaning all combat and platforming is conducted on the ground or through interactive prompts.</strong></p>



<p>If we use FromSoftware as an example, jumping has rarely been a feature of Souls games. The developer built the genre and opted to ignore a jump function for years. It’s only recently, with the likes of Sekiro and Elden Ring, that we’ve seen jumping become prevalent.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first few hours do a great job of setting the scene. They introduce you to basic attacks, then eventually new weapons, and even the Javelin. But along the way, you see various items on ledges, and gaps that look like they are crossable.</p>



<p>You’d think a man of Khazan’s now-powerful and almost demonic stature should be able to perform a simple jump. Alas, the weary warrior cannot. He can bring down giant yeti bosses and wield Greatswords that it would take 3 or 4 men to lift, but he is incapable of leaving the ground.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Soulslike games should include jumping more regularly in the gameplay? Or does it provide an extra layer of challenge you seek in the genre? Let us know your thoughts.</p>

            <p>
Well you certainly can't accuse <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> of becoming predictable. Nine years after its launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim is still somehow finding ways to surprise - and that continues with its new palaeontology themed Relics update, which is out today on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Relics sees Hello Games festooning its virtual universe with procedural prehistoric bones that budding palaeontologists can collect and trade in a sort of excavation-based 'gotta-catch-'em-all' frenzy. Bones can be acquired by digging deep beneath the earth, then assembled into skeletons based entirely on players' own whims. These in turn can be displayed back at base, meaning it's now essentially possible to create entire museums of baffling bone creations.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't stop there, however. Digs can also unearth fossils of varying rarities - some of immense value - and a new specialist has been introduced to space stations, giving players a way to barter for the missing pieces in their collection. Just be aware that digging isn't without risk; it's said dangerous new enemies can be found guarding the most valuable treasures, including Stone Ghosts, a colossal Stone Golem, and even a skeletal Titan Worm.

<p>
As is now tradition, Relics' arrival will be followed soon after by a new limited-time community expedition - this one focusing on palaeontology and challenging Travellers to compete for the rarest finds. "We think players will have a lot of fun digging into the new-found palaeontology of the universe," Hello Games adds in its announcement.

		<p>Developer Troglobytes Games and publisher Digital Vortex Entertainment have confirmed that the Lovecraftian inspired survival action game RailGods of Hysterra will be available through Steam Early Access on April 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="RailGods of Hysterra - Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlUQj4xMS3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We at Troglobytes are thrilled to invite all players to get on board the RailGod and wander through the Lovecraftian world we crafted with so much love and passion! See you all in Hysterra, and remember: Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!”</em> said Saverio Caporusso, CEO and Lead Designer at Troglobytes Games.</p>
<p><em>“To fans of cosmic horror, survival games, and those who just love trains, we’re happy to shout ‘ALL ABOARD!’”</em> said Digital Vortex CEO and Co-Founder Alex Izotov. <em>“This is an adventure we’ve been working on for a long time, and your feedback will be instrumental in shaping RailGods of Hysterra into its final form.”</em></p>
<p>In RailGods of Hysterra players can ride the train, which is infused with a RailGod, solo or team up in groups of four as you explore a world in which the Old Gods have conquered. The train can be customised by adding additional cars that can be used as storage facilities and workbenches. As you venture into this nightmare world you will face monsters and cultists that you beat in battle, or capture them to feed to the RailGod. This is a twisted world after all and the RailGod wants something in return for acting as your transport.</p>

<p>After RailGods of Hysterra releases on Steam Early Access it will eventually make its way to PS5, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-won%E2%80%99t-launch-before-2027-says-schreier.1145148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the new sci-fi intellectual property in development at Naughty Dog, won't be released before 2027. The comment was prompted by CD Projekt RED's confirmation to investors that The Witcher IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn't launch before the end of 2026</a>.</p>
<p>On the ResetEra forum, users recalled that Schreier had talked about both games (which were shown for the first time at The Game Awards 2024 in December) as being quite early in the development phase and relatively far from launch. Schreier himself then chimed in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/post-137487981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new post</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm pretty sure I said they were both going to be very early teases. Neither of those games will be out next year.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, while we didn't have any dates for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Game Director Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that fans would have to wait quite some time:</p>
<p><em>We still have a ways to go, but I'm kind of very excited to see... Again, these things are so complex and big and there's so many people involved. It's like, I still don't know exactly what this thing's gonna look like at the end. It's like, I have a theory, I have an idea, but it's still evolving and changing as we are making it.</em></p>
<p>If Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet launched in 2027, it would be seven years since the launch of Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us Part II. That's a very long time between releases, but it should be noted that Naughty Dog had nearly completed The Last of Us Online before deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancel it</a> after they realized (with Bungie's input) that the game's post-launch support would have absorbed much of the studio's efforts for years to come. It is quite likely that if The Last of Us Online was not canceled, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would have been postponed even further away.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Witcher IV will also be the studio's next full game release after Cyberpunk 2077's late 2020 debut. CD Projekt RED did not cancel a game in between, but they were busy improving Cyberpunk 2077 and releasing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Moreover, the studio has transitioned from its in-house RED Engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say there are reasons why these games are taking so long. Nonetheless, it's becoming apparent that the largest triple-A games can now take between five and seven years to complete, which makes it all the more challenging to invest in them, as failure would be catastrophic to a studio after spending so much time and resources.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital will release a new update for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>later today, and as ever, it's adding some new cars, one of which is a certified British classic.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">last month's Update 1.56</a>, the aptly-named Update 1.57's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is the Aston Martin Vantage '18, which Sony says has been referred to as "the best Aston Martin ever". It's the 2018 version of a car that became its own model line back in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second new car in this update is the&nbsp;Mazda CX-30 X Smart Edition ‘21, a crossover SUV designed to marry the best parts of sports utility vehicles with the convenience and compact nature of regular civvie cars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=VPLPHh-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=lP86IOP4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.57 has some new cars for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you can also drive the&nbsp;Renault Kangoo 1.4 ‘01 in this update. It's a "popular leisure activity vehicle that started life as a commercial van", according to Sony. It's not a powerful machine, but it should get you from A to B, at least.</p>

<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new events in the World Circuits mode, as well as new Sophy AI enhancements and more. You can read everything that's new in this update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's the latest entry in Sony's long-running&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of racing games. Like its predecessors, the game is a "simcade" racer, which means it balances realistic simulation with arcade-style accessibility and ease of use.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is also the only&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>game it's currently possible to play without resorting to the second-hand market; last year, Sony delisted the PS4's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">without warning</a>, although it's still possible to play the offline portions of the game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Update 1.57 lands at 10pm Pacific tonight (that's 1am the following morning in Eastern time).</p>

Earlier this month, series creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">Neil Druckmann cast doubt on the prospect of The Last of Us 3</a>, saying: “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if there’s no The Last of Us 3, would Naughty Dog and Druckmann keep the TV show going past the games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the question IGN put to Druckmann himself on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, and he replied to say that while he has an ending of The Last of Us story in mind, because he’s not sure if he’ll get the chance to make The Last of Us 3, he’s leaving nothing on the line.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have to have an ending,” Druckmann said. “When I made The Last of Us 1, I didn’t know if there was going to be a sequel, so that had to be a definitive ending. When I worked on Uncharted 4, I don’t know if we’ll ever get to do it again. I need it to be a definitive ending. Last of Us 2, same way. All these things have to line up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know how long I’ll keep doing this or whether I’ll be given another opportunity. So I leave nothing on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now it’s like, we have an ending in mind. And that ending will be it. That ending will be it for this story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One question hanging over Druckmann is if he will even have the time to make The Last of Us 3, were it to be green lit for production. That’s because he has his hands full with The Last of Us TV show, which is set to round-out the events of The Last of Us 2 video game with Season 2 and Season 3, and the recently announced PlayStation game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as everything else, and you’re asking me about future games, my time so much is, we have to finish this season,” Druckmann continued. “We’re not quite done. We’re almost there. Knock on wood we get to do it again. Season 3, there’s a lot more story we have to cover, as you know with game two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then my hands are pretty full with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Character Posters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Druckmann teased a "concept" for a potential The Last of Us 3 at the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU&amp;ab_channel=NaughtyDog" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, noting that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first game had such a clean concept of like, the unconditional love a parent feels for their child," he said. "The second one, once we landed on this idea of the pursuit of justice at any cost, justice for the ones you love, we felt like, 'there's a clean concept here and there's a throughline from the first game, about love.' If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. Last bite of the apple, the story's done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The great thing about working at Naughty Dog is that we don't have to," he added. "It's always like, 'we would love another Last of Us, but if you guys feel you're passionate about something else, we'll support this other thing.' Very privileged position to be in, I never take that for granted. I've been just thinking about it, 'is there a concept there?' And for now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have that concept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Then I saw that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Scarlet &amp; Violet – Surging Sparks Booster Bundle</a> was somehow <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXEDw?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">still in stock on Amazon for $45.02</a> following its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">massive Pokémon TCG restock</a>. The restock has come at a great time, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-spring-sale-2025">Amazon Spring Sale</a> in full swing, there are plenty of hot sets to pick up while stock lasts. Suddenly, my willpower crumbled like a 60 HP Basic tackling a 390-damage Hydreigon ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite? This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> set is chaos in the best way. You’ve got chase cards that deserve to be slabbed, like the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5AlX?object_uuid=97f4f848-ef36-4c95-a72e-88d7b7b771c5&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$432 Pikachu ex Special Illustration Rare</a>. That’s not a typo. The little electric mouse is putting in work as both a collectible and a monster in battle. Topaz Bolt deletes nearly anything from the board, and Resolute Heart makes it annoyingly hard to knock out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Latias ex and Latios combo, pulling a full-on romance movie moment with matching connected artwork. Latias is the rarer and, apparently, the more expensive twin at over $200. I guess big sibling energy costs more. Meanwhile, Milotic ex is out here channeling its inner supermodel with light and shadow drama, and somehow also counters Tera Pokémon like it moonlights as a meta card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My personal favorite? Ceruledge. It’s giving neon fever dreams, and I mean that as a compliment. This is the first time its card has actually been valuable, and I think illustrator Rond deserves a standing ovation. Or at least a coffee. Ceruledge isn’t even a top-tier Pokémon competitively, but with this art, I don’t care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a collector, the value potential is real. If you're a player, some of these cards slap on the battlefield. And if you just like shiny things and the thrill of gambling $45 on cardboard, welcome to the club. I already cracked one box and I’m convincing myself I “need” another for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes six booster packs, so you’re not guaranteed any heavy hitters, but at the rate people are snapping these up, I wouldn't wait too long.

Crafting meaningful, engaging moments of choice and consequence can be difficult for some developers to navigate, but when a game really makes you stop and consider why you’re doing something beyond just a raw desire to extract the maximum amount of content, that’s when you’ve struck gold. Some choices are big, some are meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but if it’s done well, even the most minute decision can stick with you. Here are a few of the choices we’ve agonized over in games.</p></div><div><p>The final choice in the first <em>Life Is Strange </em>game is controversial because it effectively negates everything else you’ve done in the supernatural teen drama while also giving you an impossible moral conundrum. As Max, a time-traveling teenager who has been through more trauma in the past week than most people go through in a lifetime, you’re asked to either sacrifice the entire seaside town of Arcadia Bay to a storm caused by Max’s repeated use of her time manipulation, letting you save your best friend Chloe while many residents die, or go back to the beginning of her story when she first discovered her powers and not use them, letting Chloe die but preserving the town. Developer Don’t Nod created an agonizing and airtight dilemma with no “good” ending that could make everybody happy. It forces you to declare what matters most to you, and a decade later, people are still disputing which was the right choice.</p></div><div><p>You know how it’s weird that we ask high school students to pick a career track and dedicate years of their lives to it in higher education, just hoping it all works out for them down the road? Picking your starter Pokémon is kind of like that. Yeah, you might gravitate toward one little guy or another based on whether or not you think they’re cute or cool, but if you don’t know what their final forms look like or what challenges await you throughout the game, you might have set yourself up for a bad time. What if you don’t like your starter’s final form? How likely is it that your starter will have bad match-ups in the early game and you may struggle to make any real progress for several hours? There are so many unknowns when picking your first friend, and you might not know if you’ll regret it until it’s too late. That’s a lot of pressure to put on a 10-year-old trainer.</p></div><div><p>Fighting games can be overwhelming. There are mechanics to learn, combos to memorize, and match-ups to be prepared for that you really only understand after hours of play. But part of that journey is also deciding on which character or characters you’re going to dedicate your training time to. Some of these games have dozens of fighters to choose from, and you never really know how they handle until you’ve taken them for a test run. Some people spend dozens of hours on a character just to decide they’re not the right fit. But when you find the fighter who fits your playstyle like a glove, there’s nothing like it.</p></div><div><p>Telltale took some pretty big swings with <em>Batman </em>in its episodic adventure game’s two seasons. It inverted the dysfunctional Joker/Harley Quinn relationship, had Bruce Wayne teaming up with the clown throughout, and ended on a pretty profound choice. Alfred, Bruce’s long-time butler and an invaluable support to his crime-fighting efforts, tells Batman that he no longer has the stomach for the work the two have been doing to stop crime in Gotham. He plans to leave for a permanent vacation, and while the player can protest, it ultimately comes down to whether or not Bruce will hang up the cowl or lose his closest friend. It’s a bold choice to give to the player, but it’s also one Telltale had earned over the course of two seasons. <em>The Enemy Within </em>reflects on whether or not Batman’s crusade and methods are worth the result, and at the end, it asks you to decide.</p></div><div><p>Save files are precious keepsakes for most players. Everyone has a devastating story of losing a memory card, or a younger sibling deleting your 40 hours of progress in a game. (People who’ve grown up in the era of cloud saves will never know this pain!) So when <em>Nier Automata </em>asks you in the end to delete your save in order to help someone else playing through PlatinumGames’ action RPG, it’s no small matter. By this point, you’ve put dozens of hours into the game, likely collected a ton of loot, and unraveled plenty of mysteries in the post-apocalyptic world. Giving all that up to help a stranger? What if I still have optional stuff I haven’t finished yet? You can decline and come back later, but once you do it, it’s done. The game makes a big show of it, too, painstakingly erasing your menus and inventory. Most choices you make in video games aren’t final, as you can just save scum your way around them. <em>Nier Automata</em> makes you live with a choice, even if you won’t see any material benefit from it.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy is full of choices that cause ripple effects from one game to the next. One of the most infamous happens in the first game. On the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard is forced to choose between saving only one of their first two crewmates: Kaidan Alenko or Ashley Williams. The decision not only takes an emotional toll on the Normandy’s crew, but it fundamentally changes your party for not one, but two games. Whoever survives Virmire will go on to become a potential rival or party member for the rest of the trilogy, and even within that fixed role, Kaidan and Ashley deviate pretty strongly from one another and can completely change a party dynamic. <em>Mass Effect </em>may not have nailed every instance of choice and consequence carryover across all three games, but the decision the player makes on Virmire starts one of the best-executed threads across all three games.</p></div><div><p>Sure, the decision you make as the President of the United States at the beginning of <em>Saints Row IV</em> doesn’t actually change anything, but it’s about the principle. You’ve only got enough clout to solve one of Earth’s biggest problems: cure cancer or end world hunger. It’s a silly little hypothetical that will be quickly derailed by the game’s inciting incident, but yeah, I still want to know what people choose. Even as I write this I’m wondering which would be more of an immediate good. Probably cure cancer? Maybe? World hunger could be eradicated with some change in policies, but an instant “cure cancer” button? That’s too good to pass up, right? I’m making the right decision, right? Oops, no time to think about it; there’s an alien invasion happening.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Fable </em>series is typically a binary, good vs. evil affair. The series got a bit more gray as it went on, but most of its choices were of the “will you help people or beat them to death with a stick” type shit that was common in the early 2000s. <em>Fable II</em>’s final choice is a bit more complex. You’re given a choice between one of three wishes: revive the citizens of Albion who died over the course of the game, resurrect your family, or suddenly amass a whopping 1 million gold for you to spend as you please. The decision can completely change the world’s perception of you. A hero who revives the citizens will be met with applause and celebration as they travel through the world, whereas someone who chooses wealth will only receive disdain and ridicule wherever they go. If you want to be a truly evil bastard that’s all well and good, but I can’t imagine anyone not choosing to revive their family and loyal canine companion.</p></div><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has plenty of big choices, but perhaps the most affecting is in its <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion. The spy thriller DLC puts you in the middle of a dispute between a government agent, Solomon Reed, and a terminally ill netrunner, Songbird. Solomon wants to bring her in so she can continue to be a tool of the state, and Songbird wants to be free to seek life-saving medical treatment. Both of them reach out to the player with their respective plans, and it’s up to you to decide who you will betray at a pivotal moment. Making either choice will send you down one of two very different paths with a completely divergent endgame. Neither is entirely satisfying, and you have to play through both to get the full picture, but no one leaves <em>Phantom Liberty </em>unscathed. It’s just a matter of who you’re willing to sell out in order to reach the finish line.</p></div><div><p>Most post-apocalyptic games have some element of supply scarcity—consider, for instance, how you have to scrounge for the limited number of tools you can craft with in <em>The Last of Us</em>—but Telltale’s first season of <em>The Walking Dead</em> may handle this concept more memorably than any other game. In its second episode, protagonist Lee Everett is given food rations to divide between a group of survivors, and it’s made clear to you that there isn’t enough for everyone. There are children, irritable adults, and, of course, yourself to consider. No matter who you choose, someone is going to be left wanting, and desperate people can hold a grudge like no other. Choosing who gets half an apple can sour people on you or others, and you didn’t ask to be put in this position. It was thrust upon you, and now you’ll bear all the responsibility and consequences of your actions. The group will remember this.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Gears of War </em>series isn’t one known for choice and consequence, but <em>Gears 5 </em>throws a gut punch of a decision at you in the end. As Kait Diaz, you’re forced to choose which of your two companions to save. The trio of Kait, Del Walker, and JD Fenix has been together since <em>Gears of War 4</em> and was essentially the “next generation” of COG soldiers after Marcus Fenix’s run in the first three games. Now, no matter what you do, the group is one friend short. To this day, we still don’t know how the <em>Gears of War </em>series will handle this decision because there hasn’t been a sequel to the 2019 shooter yet. The next game is a prequel called <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, but JD’s voice actor has hinted that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-6-jd-fenix-actor-reveal-announcement-1851435150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-6-jd-fenix-actor-reveal-announcement-1851435150">something else might be in the works</a></span>.</p></div><div><p>The reason that <em>The Witcher 3</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-the-witcher-3s-bloody-baron-quest-1736090893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-the-witcher-3s-bloody-baron-quest-1736090893">most famous quest</a></span> is such an impactful one is not just because of the choice you have to make but because the twists and turns it contains are dizzying and difficult to swallow. Geralt meets a man known as the Bloody Baron, whose life story is a tragic, sympathetic one full of highs and lows. His “Family Matters” quest line, however, ties many threads from his life together until they all lead to an impossible decision. No matter what Geralt does, the Bloody Baron’s story ends tragically. It’s just a matter of where Geralt directs the most damage. By the time you make the final choice in the quest line, you’ve seen so much misfortune tied to one man that reaching this point with no real solution in sight is painful, but it also exemplifies the best parts of <em>The Witcher 3</em>’s storytelling and quest design.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
