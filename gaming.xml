			<p>Grinding Gear Games released <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/">Path of Exile 2 </a>in early access last December, and hardcore ARPG fans have praised it for fulfilling their desire for a challenge that Diablo IV has been unable to satisfy. Today, in an <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pathofexile">extensive live stream</a>, the studio delved into the many changes coming in its Third Edict update, which goes live at the end of this month on August 29, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll also be going live as part of a free weekend promotion, so if you've been curious about trying Path of Exile 2 for yourself, you'll be able to jump in alongside veterans of the game's early access period when the new update goes live.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest changes in this update include the removal of the Cruel difficulty level, with the studio introducing three interlude acts that players can go through as part of changes to the endgame experience. The introduction of trading is also, of course, major news for the player base.</p>



<p>The introduction of a new act, however, with Act IV being added to the game with this update, is the headlining addition for most players.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the Third Edict is the addition of a new league, Secrets of Abyssal, which introduces a number of cool features for how players can adjust and re-adjust their character builds. </p>



<p>The full patch notes will reveal all of the specifics that hardcore fans of the series will want to dig into, but those won't arrive until a bit closer to the update's launch next week. For now, you can pore over the live stream and look forward to what's to come in Path of Exile 2 next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The legal battle around Subnautica 2 between Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill and their former parent company KRAFTON continues, as the studio that Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire all co-founded, Unknown Worlds, has now <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM">filed a lawsuit against Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire</a>.</p>



<p>This comes <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/">a little more than a week after KRAFTON filed its own lawsuit</a> against Gill, Cleveland and McGuire, and since Unknown Worlds is wholly owned by KRAFTON, it appears that this suit is meant to pile on even more pressure on the three co-founders.</p>



<p>This new suit also includes what appear to be Slack messages meant to back KRAFTON's claims that Cleveland and McGuire were no longer working on Subanutica 2, and that they had moved on to personal projects while the rest of the team was left to pick up the pieces.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">filing their lawsuit against KRAFTON</a>, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire haven't added anything to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">long list of events </a>that encompass this story, and it's worth asking where this suit from Unknown Worlds originates.</p>



<p>It carries many of the same allegations that KRAFTON already laid out in its own filing, that Cleveland and McGuire allegedly "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at Unknown Worlds, which impacted development on Subnautica 2, and that the co-founders were prepared to release a sub-standard version of Subnautica 2 in the interest of earning the <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that has been at the centre of this entire dispute.</p>



<p>"<em>Acting out of pure self-interest, the Key Employees pushed to release any game - even one that was underdeveloped and had received a litany of disappointing reviews - into circulation on a timeline that maximized their earnout, even if it meant disappointing Subnautica's devoted fans and damaging the franchise</em>," the suit reads. </p>



<p>Is this just KRAFTON adding more pressure and filing a second time under the Unknown Worlds name, because it can, or does the driving force of Unknown Worlds filing its own lawsuit stem from members of staff genuinely taking umbrage with their former bosses? The truth of the matter is unclear, and though we tried asking KRAFTON about the intentions behind this suit and if it aligns with the views of Unknown Worlds staff, we received no response prior to publication. We'll update this story if we do hear back.</p>



<p>In the meantime, what is clear is that we are in the long haul for this dispute, and there are some questions about this situation that we may never learn the real answers to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a> <span>is one of the most exciting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512"><span>third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch 2</span></a><span>. Who among us doesn’t want to get our shit rocked on the go? Well, according to folks who have played FromSoftware’s action RPG at Gamescom in Cologne, the system is apparently struggling to run the game in handheld mode, and to make matters more worrisome, Bandai Namco is reportedly not letting people record footage of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM"><i><span>Nintendo Life</span></i></a> <span>posted a video on its YouTube channel discussing the port and said that while they only played the Switch 2 port for about 15 minutes, the game looks pretty good visually, but leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance. The tutorial ran pretty well at a locked 30fps. Once they reached the open world, everything changed.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible,” </span><i><span>Nintendo Life </span></i><span>video producer Felix Sanchez said. “Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this—maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that—It was like playing </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span>. It was like 20 frames per second, sometimes I was like, ‘This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sanchez says that in the Switch 2’s handheld mode, the game was “incredibly unstable” in the open-world segments, even in surprisingly static areas where few enemies were on screen at once. You can hear his full impressions below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="We've Played Elden Ring on Switch 2 and Have Concerns" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Hq3m8UwhGM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>So if you’re wondering why </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>footage is conspicuously absent from the internet’s Gamescom coverage, now you know that Bandai Namco has prohibited it. The game is supposed to launch on the Switch 2 this year, but it doesn’t have a release date at the moment. It’s entirely possible the game could be delayed into 2026 to fix things up, or that things could turn around by the time it finally comes out. Whatever the case, it sounds like </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> on Switch 2 has not made the best first impression.</span></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> won't be leaving early access and launching in full this year, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2s-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">Path of Exile 2's huge The Third Edict update</a>, which adds the ARPG's fourth campaign act, new temporary interlude acts, its first seasonal league, and more, Rogers said that despite his hopes earlier in the year, Path of Exile 2 won't fully release in 2025. That also means the game won't be going free-to-play anytime soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiA_IFmidOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KiA_IFmidOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I definitely don't believe that's possible anymore," Rogers said. "Things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped. Ultimately, there's two things that need to happen before we can leave early access. One of them is that we obviously need to finish the campaign. I don't think that will take too much longer. But the other one is we have to get to the point of balance where everyone is actually happy with how things are. The general opinion needs to be that we've actually got it locked in. Obviously we can't go into full release until we've sorted that out. Once those two things are true, then we'll release."</p><p dir="ltr">While The Third Edict update adds Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, developer Grinding Gear Games still needs to release Acts V and VI. Rogers said that while Act V will definitely come as part of early access, it's possible Act VI's arrival would coincide with the game's full launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There are still five classes yet to be added to Path of Exile 2 as well--the Templar, Druid, Shadow, Marauder, and Duelist. One nearly made it into The Third Edict, Rogers said, but ultimately didn't make the cut.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still intended to get a class out for this one, we just didn't quite finish it in time," Rogers said. "There will definitely be a class in the next update, I'd say. I say definitely even though I probably shouldn't, but the classes unfortunately have a bit of unbounded amount of time. You can go into them thinking you know what they are and then by the time you're actually done, you've refactored a bunch of things a bunch of times and it's way harder than you expect. We had a class in mind, we did a lot of work on it. We realized, 'You know what, if we're going to finish off all these bosses and things, we can't quite finish the class,' so it ended up not happening, but we'll get there."</p><p dir="ltr">GGG has previously said it expected Path of Exile 2 to be in early access for "at least" six months. Towards the beginning of this year, GGG announced it was putting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-throwing-a-wrench-into-updates-for-poe-1-we-were-fooling-ourselves/1100-6529154/" data-ref-id="1100-6529154">major update on hold for the original Path of Exile</a> in order to work on updates for Path of Exile 2. At the time, Rogers said the studio "still had a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to dive into Path of Exile 2 but don't want to pay for early access, the game will be holding a free weekend August 29-September 1 to coincide with the launch of The Third Edict update.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In Halloween: The Game, players will take on the roles of either residents of Haddonfield, Illinois or The Shape himself, Michael Myers. As residents, players will need to survive, stick to the shadows, warn other residents, and hopefully reach the authorities before Michael gashes them up.</p><p>The game will offer a single-player story mode, offline bots mode, and online asymmetrical PvP. It will also include multiple maps and "authentic locations" pulled from the classic film. Last October, GameSpot spoke to several creators working in the space of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/" data-ref-id="1100-6527506">adapting horror movies into games</a>. Gun Media CEO, Wes Keltner, told me at that time that he wanted "to work with [Illfonic] again, 100%. So I'm hoping that we can find something that is a good fit for both our teams at the right time."</p><p>At that time, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-halloween-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-is-in-development-gamer-john-carpenter-is-involved/1100-6525712/" data-ref-id="1100-6525712">Halloween project built in Unreal Engine 5 had already been teased by Boss Team Games</a>, a publisher that also operates in the horror movie-to-game pipeline, having previously worked on things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retrorealms-double/" data-ref-id="5000-639530">RetroRealms</a>. It's unclear at this time whether this is that same Halloween game. It seems to be, in which case it would seem Boss Team is no longer involved, and instead, the Friday The 13th duo has achieved their reunion.</p><p>In the time since Friday The 13th, Illfonic has gone on to make other licensed multiplayer games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Meanwhile, Gun put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned to GameSpot for much more on this upcoming horror project. </p>

<p>Is it tarnished?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo has a pretty big booth at Gamescom this year, with a large chunk of areas dedicated to the glut of third-party ports coming to (or are already out on) the Switch 2.</p>
<p>One of those upcoming titles is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, which brings the highly-acclaimed open-world RPG from FromSoftware to Nintendo's new console. This rerelease includes the base game, the <strong>Shadow of the Erdtree</strong> DLC, new weapons, classes, and armour. So we knew we had to try it out on the newer console.</p>
<p>And, after spending time with the game in handheld mode, our man on the ground Felix has <em>some</em> concerns about performance. Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to capture any footage, including over-the-shoulder footage (Both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDiSIezfsrw&amp;ab_channel=GVG">GVG</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025">IGN corroborate this</a>), so you'll have to use your imagination.</p>
<p>Felix talks about experiencing multiple instances of frame drops and stuttering while out in the open world, particularly after leaving the tutorial area. Of course, the demo is likely based on an earlier build of the game, so that's worth keeping in mind.</p>
<p>He also got to try out one of the new classes and explore part of the early-game map, Limgrave. So while we can't show you any footage, it's worth listening to what Felix has to say — and the lovely Alex's curious questions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just yesterday, at the time of this writing, before the Gamescom ONL 2025 craze started, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier reported that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-cloud-chamber-developer-suffers-layoffs-diablo-rod-fergusson-studio-head/">BioShock 4 developer Cloud Chamber was suffering layoffs</a> and letting go of an unspecified number of staff. At the same time, we learned that former Diablo general manager, Rod Fergusson, would be taking over as the new studio head. </p>



<p>Today, Take-Two confirmed the cuts, but it was Schreier who added that the cuts would affect 80 members of Cloud Chamber's 250-person team. What's more, this <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-20/take-two-guts-bioshock-studio-after-a-decade-of-development?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTcxNDU0NSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzE5MzQ1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUIxVEZHUFFRN1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.zVepbosqQPRpkHaMvUcaBAlKk73_0IkMGOvNKaKU6mE">new report from Schreier</a> also reveals that BioShock 4 might not arrive until mid-to-late 2027.</p>



<p>An internal email from 2K president David Ismailer was shared with Bloomberg, in which Ismailer commented on the decision-making process behind the layoffs, but stopped short of directly saying how many people were impacted. </p>



<p>Ismailer wrote, "<em>While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a </em><em>BioShock</em> game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p>



<p>"<em>I know this is tough news for everyone. If your role is being affected, you'll hear from your manager or studio leadership today with details on severance, career services and support resources. There is no easy way to do this, but we hope to do whatever we can to support you through this. I want to thank each of you for your dedication and hard work."</em></p>



<p>According to the sources Schreier spoke to, BioShock 4 had an internal release target of "<em>late 2026 or early 2027</em>," but thanks to this restructuring, that timeline has been pushed back further, and now the game might not arrive until sometime in mid-to-late 2027, if it arrives in 2027 at all. And even if it does make a 2027 release window, that'll still mean the game was in development for over a decade.</p>



<p>Schreier's report goes on to discuss a number of the issues Cloud Chamber has faced in that time, including a challenge that we've seen other studios fail to overcome, which is attempting to build a big-budget, triple-A game while also building up a new studio at the same time.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, to say the least, to see what has become of a game that, more than a decade ago, players were extremely excited to play. It's worth wondering whether BioShock 4 will have the same impact in 2027 that it would have had in, say, 2016, which would have been three years after BioShock Infinite's launch. </p>



<p>At this point, Take-Two has far too much invested to stop now, or at least it definitely feels like we're past the point where the game could just be killed without ever launching. Hopefully, Fergusson and the remaining team can pull something together. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Unveils DirectX Advanced Shader Delivery to Combat Shader Stuttering]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-combat-shader-stuttering/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-unveils-directx-advanced-shader-delivery-to-combat-shader-stuttering.1276425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Microsoft's DirectX team <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/introducing-advanced-shader-delivery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> a new feature called Advanced Shader Delivery. This feature will make its debut on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds (now officially inbound <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-release-date-gamescom-2025/">on October 16</a> for $549.99 and $899.99, respectively), but it will eventually roll out to regular PCs. A dedicated AgilitySDK will be released to game developers next month, allowing them to integrate the functionality in their upcoming and even existing games.</p>



<p>The purpose of Advanced Shader Delivery, which was co-developed with Xbox and AMD, is to address one of the banes of PC gamers: shader stuttering. The DirectX team said:</p>



<p><em>We have partnered with teams across Xbox and at AMD to precompile this data and distribute it at download time for key titles via the Xbox PC app This approach not only gets you into your games faster, but it also prevents most instances of stutter that cause performance issues.</em> <em>As an example, in Obsidian Entertainment’s Avowed, our engineering teams observed launch times reduced by as much as 85%. This not only means you’re playing your game faster, but your battery life is spent on playtime, not compiling.</em></p>



<p>The process involves a new method of collecting shader data from any game and packaging it in a new, standardized format called a State Object Database (SODB). The DirectX engineers successfully separated the shader compiler from the graphics driver and united the game data in the SODB with the compiler in the cloud to create a Precompiled Shader Database (PSDB). The PSDB can then be distributed by the Xbox Store alongside the game, supplementing the shader cache. When a game runs for the first time, it sees that all the necessary shaders are already available in a Windows cache and can therefore skip the compilation step on the gaming device. If a device receives a driver update, the app will detect this and automatically update the shader cache.</p>





<figure></figure>



<p>The caveat is that in the beginning, this will only work on titles distributed via the Xbox app, not Steam (or the Epic Games Store, GOG, Ubisoft Connect, etc.). However, other storefronts may eventually integrate the feature via the upcoming AgilitySDK.</p>



<p>It'll be intriguing to see whether Advanced Shader Delivery can truly help with solving the issue of shader stuttering in PC games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anno-117-pax-romana-%E2%80%93-the-final-preview.1276413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">My first hands-on with Anno 117: Pax Romana left me excited for Ubisoft Mainz' latest take on the city-builder, which tasks players with founding a thriving metropolis within the Roman Empire. But I wouldn't necessarily say I was intrigued by it. The studio made significant strides in its game design with 2018's industrial revolution-focussed Anno 1800, and 117 felt wary of rocking the boat in the wake of 1800’s success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Pax Romana demonstrated some interesting ideas, like enabling production buildings to affect the mood and prosperity of nearby structures, forcing you to think more carefully about your city's layout, it otherwise felt a little safe, a little familiar. That isn't necessarily a huge problem—getting to build Roman cities with 1800’s core systems was enough of a hook, and I would merrily play that game. But I was nonetheless left wondering whether stepping deeper into the past would inhibit Ubisoft Mainz from carrying the city-builder forward.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Anno 117: Pax Romana - May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then again, I'd only seen half of the game. That initial preview session focussed on constructing a city in the province of Latium, one of two provinces you'll be able to manage in Anno 117's nebulous, historically unmoored representation of Rome. All lush green hills, lavender fields, and terracotta rooftops, Latium offers everything you'd expect from a city-builder set in the Roman Empire, and perhaps because of that, it doesn't feel especially surprising.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What's immediately interesting is that you can start the game in either province, establishing yourself there before expanding to the other province later.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">By comparison, my more recent play session let players choose between Latium and Albion. Anno 117's second province is drastically different from Latium's Mediterranean paradise, and where Anno 117 has the chance to stand out from other games that depict the legacy of Rome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's immediately interesting is that you can start the game in either province, establishing yourself there before expanding to the other province later. This is a big change from Anno 1800, where you always started in the European-themed Old World before establishing colonies in the tropical New World, exporting exotic goods like cacao and bananas for your industrialised hoi-polloi to enjoy at home.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">How this starting choice will affect the structure of trade between Anno 117's two provinces isn't wholly clear. Yet what is clear is that building a city in Albion feels substantially different from constructing one in Latium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, Albion looks and fields a world away from Latium. Where Latium's undulating landscape is vividly green and inviting, Albion is wild, weird, and wet. Its landscape is all brownish scrub, dark evergreen forests, and glistening marshland wracked constantly by wind and rain. Imagined from the perspective of a Roman soldier, it feels appropriately alien, the last place any Centurion who marched out of Italy would want to end up (then again, as someone who lives in Scotland and begins to melt in any temperature above 18 degrees Celsius, it feels fondly like home.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Establishing a settlement remains roughly the same between the two provinces. Your basic construction material is still timber, sourced by placing logging camps in forests, then transporting those logs to nearby woodcutters to be fashioned into building materials. Roads still start out as simple dirt paths, and all production buildings require a nearby warehouse to efficiently transport goods around your settlement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Likewise, the economic fundamentals are also the same. Basic income is generated by houses, but only when you meet the needs and desires of the class of citizen who lives in that dwelling. Once you meet all those needs, you can then upgrade the building to house a higher class of citizen. This generates more income, but involves fulfilling more complex needs that require exponentially more elaborate production chains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new addition to Anno 117, you can also boost a house's income (and other stats like 'happiness' and 'health'), by placing certain production buildings within your residential areas. Building a tunic spinner among your dwellings, for example, provides +1 income for every home inside the spinner's radius. Other buildings, like charcoal burners, can have a negative impact on these stats, so you want to keep those distanced from your core settlement. The intent is to fold in extra strategy and reward more thoughtful city-planning, and from my experience with both sides of the game, it works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet while the underlying systems are the same, the actual production chains vary significantly from those of Latium. Your lowest class of citizen, which in Albion are named 'Waders', subsist on a diet of cockles and eels dredged from the abundant waters around you. Your second-tier building material isn't roman brick but wattle-and-daub, created by mixing mud with dried cattail reeds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these resources are harvested from an environment that you don't see in Latium at all—the marshes. Far more than a thematic affectation in Albion, its wetlands are a crucial part of Celtic civilisation. Many Celtic buildings can be constructed on the marsh itself, and some of them—like reed farms and cattle pens—can only be built within the fens, erected on wooden poles driven into the mud, and strung together with creaking networks of boardwalks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Many Celtic buildings can be constructed on the marsh itself, and some of them—like reed farms and cattle pens—can only be built within the fens, erected on wooden poles driven into the mud, and strung together with creaking networks of boardwalks.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While these buildings afford a distinguishing flavour to Albion, curiously, it’s the boardwalks that make the most difference mechanically. These are constructed in the same way as roads; by dragging them across the landscape with your mouse. Yet where roads simply cost coin to build, boardwalks require timber. Since every major structure requires timber at the outset, this means you have a much higher initial demand for building materials Albion than you do in Latium, which makes getting your settlement up and running slightly more challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside this greater resource pressure, the boardwalks cause several other complications. Like regular buildings, marshland structures require access to a warehouse, further increasing your timber cost. Moreover, many wetland-specific production buildings need plenty of additional space for reed crops and cattle paddies, which can easily encroach upon one another and reduce productivity. Consequently, laying out the boardwalks to maximise space without obliterating your wood supply makes for an unexpectedly challenging spatial puzzle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What results, even at this early stage, is a highly distinctive settlement, a semi-aquatic village with one foot soaked in prehistory. Where Albion truly begins to fascinate, however, is what happens when you start upgrading these basic buildings to accommodate a higher class of citizen. Upon upgrading your first house, Albion's Anno map presents you with a choice: do you want your structure to house 'Romano-Celts’ (i.e. native Celts who have converted to a Roman lifestyle), or do you want to maintain the culture and architecture of your home nation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which of these you prioritise leads to diverging needs and desires, and thus different production chains. Higher-tier Celts want to eat cheese and adorn themselves with fancy bracelets, while Romano-Celts want to eat more Imperial cuisine and maintain their appearance with the use of hand mirrors. On top of this, the two cultures receive improved bonuses from different traits. Romano-Celts have a more formalised education system and are thus more adept at acquiring scholarly knowledge, while Celtic peoples who keep to the old ways receive greater benefits from faith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice you make is also intended to influence the look and layout of your city. Adopting Roman culture encourages players to build a single, large metropolis, supporting which may require you to drain the marshes to create more building space and farmable land, relying on aqueducts rather than natural water bodies to keep your city hydrated. Sticking with the Celtic traditions, on the other hand, will see you continue to build in and around nature, using the wetlands and the forests without making large scale alterations to the landscape.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears you won't be forced along one of these cultural avenues for the duration of your game, either. Upgrade paths unlock again upon reaching the next tier. If you then decide you want to switch from Celtic to Romano-Celtic or vice-versa, you should be able to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How these decisions work in practice, and the impact repeatedly switching between one or the other has on your settlement, I cannot say. This play session was considerably shorter than my time with Latium, just long enough to establish a basic settlement and get a quick overview of the second, Celtic civilisational tier. While there seems to be some overlap between all Anno's cultural variants, I can't say just how much Celtic and Romano-Celtic resources and structures diverge, nor what the differences are between the hybrid Romano-Celtic lifestyle and the pure, Latium-derived Roman culture.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nonetheless, there is one clear evolution here over previous Anno games. Anno 1800 and the futuristic Anno 2205 treated your colonies as secondary concerns—settlements whose purpose was to support your primary metropolis. In Anno 117, building settlements in Latium and Albion will be equally involved. Indeed, given the opportunities to define its culture across multiple evolutionary phases, Albion may even have more layers to it than the dedicated Roman settled that would, theoretically, serve as the epicentre the Empire. Colour me intrigued.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

The announcement comes a little over a month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707586/analogue-3d-4k-n64-delay-august-2025">after the console’s previous delay</a>, which would’ve seen it ship at the end of August.</p><p>While the July announcement cited the ongoing mess around tariffs as the reason for that delay, the cause for the current delay is less clear.</p><p>“Analogue has been moving at maximum pace, processing shipping to everyone who has been patiently waiting,” the company wrote in a statement. “Unexpected, uncommon issues are rare. Especially in a negligible degree under esoteric circumstances. We’re ensuring every detail meets our standard.” The statement added that the launch is “at 99% percent. Hardware, system, packaging — the full kit — been set for months. The last one percent is where we’re focused.”</p><p>The company also says that the currently vague Q4 timing is “intentionally set conservatively,” presumably to avoid having to announce another delay. Full refunds <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1958247804884677035">are available</a> for those who pre-ordered.</p><div><p>The Analogue 3D was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">first announced in 2023 with plans to launch the following year</a>, and was delayed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631816/analogue-3d-delay-nintendo-64-modretro-teaser">times</a> since then.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After being in development for quite some time, Phantom Blade Zero will finally get a release date this year. The news comes from Future Games Show, which held a “Deep Dive” with the team. Alongside new gameplay, we got some new details on the combat and style.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin tasked with finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. It mixes the gameplay of Soulsborne titles and RPGs to craft an intricate combat system. Since its big reveal in 2023, fans have been hungry for more of the game, and Future Games Show delivered some promising news.</p>



<h2 id="h-phantom-blade-zero-s-release-date-announcement-happening-within-the-year">Phantom Blade Zero’s Release Date Announcement Happening Within The Year</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In the deep dive at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpPmmXxffiQ">Future Games Show</a>, director Soulframe Liang showed off new gameplay of Phantom Blade Zero. In addition, we saw cool new weapons, over 30 in fact, and wicked action combat. However, the most notable comment was about the game’s release. At the end of the presentation, Liang said that, before the year ends, we will know when the game will come out. Whether the date is concrete or a release window remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The game has been played by critics from various sites not too long ago back in July. For many, the wuxia-inspired combat system and stunning visuals left a positive mark. Following the success of other Chinese games like Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Phantom Blade Zero could be the next big one, if done right.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I don't know that we've ever seen a year quite like this one when it comes to new co-op experiences. From major-publisher-backed hits like Split Fiction and Grounded 2, to indie darlings like REPO and Peak, there hasn't just been a significant quantity of games meant for co-op play, but they've gone in so many different, yet similarly exciting, directions.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I've been left wanting for one specific reason, and I imagine other parents can relate: It's hard to find games to play with my kids, so I'm glad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-voyagers/" data-ref-id="5000-681511">Lego Voyagers</a> is just around the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Split Fiction, for example, may be regarded as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/">best co-op game</a> of the year and, more broadly speaking, a possible Game of the Year contender, much like It Takes Two before it. But Hazelight's co-op games aren't meant for smaller, less-experienced hands. Their puzzles and action sequences demand a lot from players, to the extent that I can't play it with my six-year-old, who is a lifelong gamer, but still finds such games a bit too chaotic to handle. And then there are games like REPO, a game about repossessing valuables from locales stalked by monsters, and Peak, where Boy Scouts scale mountains to reach help after a plane crash, but often plummet to their cartoonish deaths. While I'm personally okay with some of the more mature visuals and themes in these games and play them with my older child often, they can still ask too much of my youngest on the controller, and that's if their anxiety-inducing gameplay doesn't undo her.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Voyagers thankfully avoids leaving me with these hang-ups as a gaming parent looking for the next great bonding experience. Instead, what I saw in a recent hands-on demo is a laid-back, creative play space full of platforming puzzles that felt welcoming to virtually anyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4Zq-A6FAw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Filling in for my kids in my scheduled demo was my colleague, Jason Fanelli, who did a great job as my proxy child. In Lego Voyagers, we each took on the role of a small Lego brick featuring a single eye sticker. His red fella and my blue dude rolled around a world that looks very much like Light Brick Studio's earlier award-winning game, Lego Builder's Journey. Our path was paved with bricks constructed and colored to look like the sights you'd see on a nature walk. Quickly, we came upon a Lego playground, with various contraptions familiarizing us with the world's physics-based systems, before a rocket launch in the distance had us on our way to explore some more.</p><p dir="ltr">With the world consisting of what you could call a series of interconnected micro-sets, it was up to us to complete these dioramas with our ingenuity. In each section, Lego bricks of different shapes, sizes, and colors would be freely available for us to build a solution to a problem posed by the location. One of the earliest sections tasked us with traversing a gap over water. Naturally, a bridge was in order, so Jason and I worked together to build one. There was no timer, no enemy presence. It was just us, some loose bricks, and the problem in front of us. It gave me the distinct, familiar feeling of spilling out a bunch of Lego bricks onto a table and seeing what my kids and I come up with, free of any instruction booklet.</p><p dir="ltr">A bridge is simple enough--though I won't hide the fact that it took us a few minutes to master the building controls--but later sections demanded a bit more thought. Still, the level of strategy and controller inputs needed to succeed never got to the extent that I felt like any would-be players would be left behind due to a skill gap, at least not from what I've played so far. I got the sense this was an intentional choice, which we'll hopefully see throughout the entire game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481"></a><figcaption>You'll build bridges, both literal and figurative, in Lego Voyagers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As an example of the types of puzzles you'll face, one memorable moment saw us needing to throw together a bunch of loose cylindrical pieces, creating a tall pole-like object. With each of us at an end of this pole, we could climb the terrain, wobbling up and over each natural step, moving end over end like a stiff Slinky. It was very satisfying, and though I'm sure this was the intended solution, the game's physics meant the answer still felt imprecise and experimental in a manner that ties nicely with Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">Like those aforementioned Hazelight games, Lego Voyagers must be played in co-op. There's no solo mode, and that's for good reason. The entire game's aesthetic creates the sense of a cozy bonding experience built specifically for two people to collaborate and enjoy each other's company. It's made complete with a soft soundtrack of chill, lo-fi music that I instantly adored.</p><p dir="ltr">As a whole, the game reminded me of the difference between a Studio Ghibli movie made for kids and something like The Minions Movie. The former balances adolescent whimsy with its mature writing so well, trusting its younger audience to get on its level, and leaving space for its world to breathe. The latter feels like a loud ad for a sugary cereal that no "balanced breakfast" actually requires. Surely there can be times for each type of experience, but I really appreciated how Light Brick Studio sought to provide an environment more conducive to restful, creative play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483"></a><figcaption>Waterfront property is a bit more affordable in Lego form.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Growing up with Lego, I've always found something so meditative about its building process; working through its numbered instructions can put a person in something like a flow state as they thoughtfully place each brick where it belongs. Playing Lego Voyagers gave me a strong sense of that familiar feeling I never outgrew, and I'm excited my kids will be able to enjoy it with me, just like when we decorate the dining room table with hundreds of colorful toy bricks.</p><p dir="ltr">LEGO Voyagers launches on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 15.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a> is a free-to-play tactical FPS that offers explosive 32v32 battles across three unique modes. With so many players in each match, it's perfectly reasonable to expect cross-play support to ensure that you're always able to find enough players to fill out each team. Plus, if you're trying to play with your friends, you'll want to be sure you can all group up together regardless of your platform preferences. So, let's take a look at Delta Force's cross-play situation, as well as break down its cross-progression situation.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-play?</h2><p><strong>Yes, Delta Force does have cross-play between PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC players</strong>. But players on those platforms can not play with anyone on iOS or Android, as the mobile versions are only cross-play with one another.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXRDS1_GEs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgXRDS1_GEs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're on console, you can check in <strong>Settings &gt; Game</strong> to ensure you have cross-play toggled on. If you'd prefer to only play with folks on consoles, you'll want to keep this toggled off. However, if your friends are on PC, this has to be toggled on for you to play with them. The game does not have a cross-play toggle on PC, meaning PC players will always be placed in potentially mixed lobbies.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-progression?</h2><p>Cross-progression in Delta Force is a bit complicated. Everything revolves around a <a href="https://pass.levelinfinite.com/?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Level Infinite Pass</a> (rather humorously abbreviated to LIPASS), and if you're not careful, you may encounter limitations that can stop you from being able to use cross-progression altogether.</p><p>If you've already played Delta Force on PC or mobile, you'll have already been forced to sign up for a LIPASS, as it's required on those platforms. As such, <strong>make sure you immediately sign in to your LIPASS account when you first start the game on console</strong>. If you play the game without linking to your LIPASS account, you'll be blocked from using cross-progression.</p><p>If you're just starting Delta Force on console and have never played it elsewhere, you'll still want to make sure you <strong>create a LIPASS account when prompted on your first bootup</strong>. If you fail to do so, your account will be stuck on the console you're on, meaning you can never carry your progress to any other platform in the future.</p><p>If you're a console player and know beyond a shadow of a doubt you'll never play Delta Force on any other platform, you can skip creating a LIPASS account. Again, however, just be aware that you'll never be able to move that progress over if you change your mind, so give it some careful consideration before making that decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wolcen Studio has finally revealed the real title of its PvPvE extraction game, which, up until now, we've only known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolcen-studios-project-pantheon-will-host-its-second-closed-alpha-test-later-this-month/">Project Pantheon</a>. It's officially called Gods, Death, and Reapers, and we just got a new gameplay trailer showcased during the Future Games Show at Gamescom 2025.</p>



<p>The isometric RPG is still fairly early in development, as there was no release date or even release window announced alongside the official title reveal, but it is available for you to try if you're interested. Just head over to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Gods_Death__Reapers/">Steam page</a> and request access for the closed playtest to jump in now.</p>

<p>"<em>Gamescom 2025 marks a huge milestone for us as we finally get to share&nbsp;</em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reaper</em>'s official name and gameplay with the world," said game director Andrei Chirculete in a press release. "<em></em><em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>&nbsp;is a game that started from one simple idea: what if you could play an extraction game that looks like a top-down ARPG? Now that this idea has turned into&nbsp;<em>Gods, Death &amp; Reapers</em>, we can't wait to hear from our players what they think, as it will help us shape up the best version throughout the coming Closed Alpha tests!"</p>
