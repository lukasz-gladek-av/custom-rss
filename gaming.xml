According to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/"><em>Variety</em></a>, a show based on BioWare’s military space opera RPG is officially in production at Amazon MGM Studios. <em>Variety</em> has reported that <em>F9: The Fast Saga </em>writer Daniel Casey has signed on to write the show with BioWare producer Mike Gamble serving as executive produce along with Ari Arad.</p><p>Though BioWare released the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22256806/mass-effect-legendary-edition-pc-ps4-xbox-one-mac-walters-release-date"><em>Mass Effect Legendary Edition</em></a> — a collection of the first three games updated for modern consoles — back in 2021, the <em>Mass Effect</em> series hasn’t had an original entry since the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em></a> back in 2017. After <em>Andromeda</em>, BioWare released <em>Anthem</em>, a live-service action game that was significant departure from the studio’s tradition of making single-player, story-driven RPGs. In 2020, BioWare announced that a new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168973/mass-effect-returns-teaser-trailer-game-awards-2020"><em>Mass Effect</em> game was in-development</a>.</p><p>News of a <em>Mass Effec</em>t TV show comes on what is known as N7 Day, a semi-official, fan-created holiday that celebrates all things <em>Mass Effect</em>. On previous N7 Days, BioWare has teased information about the next game in the series including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23951253/mass-effect-5-helmets-confirmed">a trailer that possibly suggested the return of fan-favorite protagonist Commander Shepard</a> whose story ended with the original trilogy. Though no story details have been revealed about the show, it’s a pretty safe bet to guess it’ll focus on the Commander and I personally can’t wait to see <em>her.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Daniel Casey from F9: The Fast Saga will write and executive produce the series. Karim Zreik, Ari Arad, and Michael Gamble from EA will join as executive producers. At the moment, the plot details haven’t been revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect TV’s Karim Zreik has experience with Marvel TV shows like Daredevil, The Punisher, and more. Ari Arad has worked on other game adaptations, such as Borderlands, Uncharted and more, along with Marvel Movies like Iron Man.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mass Effect is a third-person shooter franchise set in a distant future, where humans and aliens have colonised the Milky Way. Microsoft Game Studios previously published the game series, which EA later acquired.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The main series features four titles: Mass Effect (2007), Mass Effect 2 (2010), Mass Effect 3 (2012) and Mass Effect: Andromeda (2017). The original trilogy follows the journey of Commander Shepard as the character tries to save the galaxy from the hands of the Reapers. Andromeda was unrelated to the trilogy and featured a new setting and fresh characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 is getting a stacked roadmap for season one. It all starts on November 14, and Treyarch has well and truly outdone itself in preparing a sumptuous content drop. There are seven new weapons and new attachments coming to Black Ops 6 from November 14, with some dropping midway through the season just to stagger things a little.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here is every new weapon coming in Black Ops 6 season one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-guns-guns-guns">Guns, Guns, Guns</h2>



<p>There are seven major weapons being added to Black Ops 6 in season one, but they won’t all be easy to obtain. Some will only be available to unlock during special events, while others will be battle pass rewards – so you’ll need to grind a little to get to them.</p>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown of new weapons in Black Ops 6 with a note on how to unlock them:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Krig C </strong>(AR) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SAUG</strong> (SMG) – Battle Pass unlock</li>



<li><strong>SIRIN 9MM </strong>(SMG) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Power Drill </strong>(Melee) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Maelstrom </strong>(Shotgun) – Event unlock</li>



<li><strong>Cleaver </strong>(Melee) – Mid-season unlock</li>



<li><strong>AMR MOD 4 </strong>(Sniper Rifle) – Mid-season unlock</li>
</ul>



<p>And here are the two new attachments coming to the game:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Buffer Weight Stock</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon’s Breath</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s right, Treyarch is adding <strong>Dragon’s Breath </strong>to Black Ops 6. In case you’ve never heard of that, it’s the incendiary shotgun attachment that turns each shot into a blast of pure heat, lighting your enemies up in a ball of fire.</p>



<p>There are also two new conversion kits coming: XM4 and Kompakt 92 Burst Fire.</p>



<p>Treyarch has promised that there’s more to come as the season unfolds, so this might not be it.</p>

<p>Competitive fans are celebrating as Treyarch announces the impending arrival of Ranked Play in Black Ops 6. It’s bizarre that it’s surfacing before the Call of Duty League’s 2025 season has been formally announced but never mind.</p>



<p>From November 14, Ranked Play will be live in Black Ops 6, giving the more talented players a place to flex their abilities. Let’s just hope it doesn’t end up like Modern Warfare III and have the Top 250 ranks overflowing with cheaters, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-where-will-you-rank">Where Will You Rank?</h2>



<p>Treyarch revealed the roadmap for season one of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, all of which kicks off on November 14.</p>



<p>There’s a stacked content drop coming, including new maps, a fresh Resurgence experience, new modes (including Prop Hunt), and a massive host of new weapons. It’s an exciting time to be a Call of Duty fan, and hopefully, you’ve finished your Dark Matter grind in time to pick up everything that season one has to offer.</p>



<p>It’ll be as typical a competitive system as you could hope for.</p>



<p>It’s good to see that Activision has learned from past mistakes. In previous games, Ranked Play didn’t arrive for several months. Last year’s Call of Duty – Modern Warfare III – was released in October, but Ranked Play didn’t arrive until February. That was an insane gap that left ambitious fans hungry for a bigger challenge, and it harmed the game’s ecosystem to no end.</p>



<p>Will you be diving into Ranked Play when it arrives? Let us know in the comments.</p>

You can also pick up the 8BitDo N30 wireless mouse at a discounted price, as this is on sale for $19.80 (normally $30). While it has a barebones design, it includes a customizable D-Pad on the side--something you won't find on other wireless mice.

            <p>
It's been a good few years since reports surfaced Amazon was looking to adapt <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for television, but finally - as N7 day rolls around once more - the show has been made official.
</p>
<p>
A Mass Effect TV show was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors has contributed in the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.
</p>
<p>
And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">says</a> a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon, with Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties. Casey isn't a complete stranger to sci-fi, having previously written 2018 movie Kin and done rewrites for 2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane.

<p>
Also executive producing are Karim Zreik, EA's Michael Gamble, and Ari Arad, who's served as producer on everything from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a> movie and last year's terrible Borderlands adaptation, to the Spider-Verse series and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-film-releases-some-time-within-this-decade-so-thats-something">Nintendo's upcoming Zelda film</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, details of Amazon's Mass Effect adaptation are limited, but we do know ardent gamer and former Witcher Henry Cavill at one time had an interest in the project. Back in February 2021, Cavill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-teases-secret-project-that-appears-to-be-related-to-mass-effect">snapped alongside a script</a> apparently related to Mass Effect; then in December that year, not long after Amazon was said to be nearing a deal, Cavill casually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-would-love-to-discuss-being-in-the-mass-effect-tv-series">revealed</a> he'd "love to have a conversation" about it. However, with Cavill now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">confirmed to be involved with Amazon's Warhammer adaptation</a>, it's likely things have change.
</p>
<p>
One person probably <em>not</em> excited about a Mass Effect TV series is ex-Bioware lead writer David Gaider, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-bioware-writer-mass-effect-tv-show-cringe">previously said</a> the idea of BioWare television adaptations made him "cringe".
</p>
<p>
"For starters, Mass Effect and Dragon Age had a custom protagonist," he explained. "Meaning said TV show will need to pick whether said protagonist will be male or female. Boom, right off the bat you've just alienated a whole bunch of the built-in fan base who had their hopes up... Secondly, those protagonists are designed to be a bit of a blank slate, one that the player fills out with their decisions. That's not going to work for a passive medium. So, suddenly, the protagonist will have their own personality... and their own <em>story</em>. That will be weird."
</p><p>
"Both Mass Effect and Dragon Age's plots were, at best, serviceable," he continued. "Those plots had to take into account the player's agency. They were kind of the shell upon which that player's emotional engagement was delivered - usually through the companions and the choices themselves. Choice heightened engagement. Interactivity was the star, not the plot."
</p>
<p>
"Take all that out, lose most of the companions, and you potentially end up with... a pretty run-of-the-mill fantasy or science-fiction show, one where a lot of the built-in audience has possibly been turned into outraged, howling malcontents before it's even released."
</p>
<p>
Amazon has, of course, already navigated similar issues with this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV adaptation, and that ended up releasing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">significant acclaim</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">commercial success</a>. So time will tell if Gaider's concerns prove warranted.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/warhammer-40000-darktide-washes-onto-ps5-in-december/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, the grimdark sci-fi successor to Fatshark’s popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/25/vermintide-2-review-worth-playing-2022-warhammer-games/">Vermintide</a> series, is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> on 3rd December, the studio has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Coming to PS5 December 3 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_XqYUfiY7Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darktide on PS5 will have all of the content and improvements made to the game since the PC launch, and on top of that comes with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced</a> marker. That means you’ll see the following performance targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frame rate of 60 FPS on a 4K resolution for PlayStation 5 Pro</li>
<li>Performance mode (60FPS on a 1440p resolution) for PlayStation 5</li>
<li>Quality Mode (30FPS on a 4K resolution) for PlayStation 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PS5 version will likely be a pretty close match to the game on Xbox Series X, but there’s naturally that further step available for the game when playing on PS5 Pro that matches Sony’s vision for the best of both worlds between Quality and Performance modes.</p>
<p>Darktide first launched for PC in November 2022, but was met with no small amount of negativity from the Vermintide community over performance, bugs and the game progression in general. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/25/warhammer-40k-darktide-xbox-release-delayed-as-developer-focusses-on-improvements/">Fatshark postponed the Xbox Series X|S release in order to address those problems</a>, eventually launching the game on console in October 2023. Now, whether there was an exclusivity contract or not, the game is coming to PS5.</p>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide sees you joining a team of Inquisitorial Operatives, embarking on a series of missions, attempting to free a city from the clutches of the corrupted forces of Chaos. The twist is that, where you might expect to be a loyal member of the Space Marines in most 40K games, you’re actually a criminal given a chance at redemption after saving the life of an Imperial Guard officer from Chaos worshippers. That means that you won’t have all the best weapons and gear that you’d see in something like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a>, so there’s still a fair bit of melee combat alongside the gunplay.</p>
<p>We rather enjoyed the game, with Dom saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/19/warhammer-40000-darktide-review/">our review</a>, “Darktide is an absolute blast. Its heavyweight blend of melee and gunplay ensure that the flow of frantic runs into the hive city just keep on coming.”</p>

But this year, the team just put out another game, <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and doesn’t want to steal the game’s thunder with a bunch of teases for a game that’s still a ways out.

If you’ve finished Harding’s mission, “The Singing Blade,” you’ll find a chest next to the Workshop. Inside are two armor appearances called Specter of Battles Past and Paragon of Leadership as well as a helmet called Command Helmet. These aren’t armor sets with new stats, but instead are appearances you can set to wear in Rook’s room while maintaining the defense and effects of other armor sets. The Specter of Battles Past includes the recognizable red stripe down the sleeve that any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan would recognize as an homage to Commander Shepard’s armor in the original trilogy.

<p>Prop Hunt is a fan favourite mode that offers a change of pace from storming around online and sweating to grind camos. However, it hasn’t been seen in a Call of Duty game since 2020’s Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>That’s set to change, though. Treyarch has just revealed that on November 14, when Black Ops 6’s first season goes live, it’ll bring with it a new iteration of Prop Hunt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-proper-fun">Proper Fun</h2>



<p>Prop Hunt has been in a few Call of Duty games, but it’s by no means a common game mode. In recent years, it appeared in Black Ops 4, Cold War, Modern Warfare, and COD Mobile, but it has been almost four years since it was in a Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>On November 14, Treyarch and Raven Software will deploy the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and along with that comes Prop Hunt.</p>



<p>In case you’re not familiar, Prop Hunt sees one team assume the role of prop hunters, while the other team becomes a series of ‘props’. That means that they become barrels, crates, lamps, vending machines – anything around a given map that makes sense. They’ll then need to ‘hide’ as a prop while the hunters try to weed them out.</p>



<p>It’s great fun and it’s nothing competitive at all. It’s one of the most casual modes in the Call of Duty ecosystem, and that’s why gamers appreciate it. It makes a nice break from the cacophony of traditional multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>In season one, alongside Prop Hunt, Black Ops 6 players will also get access to ‘Ransack’ and Ranked Play, which is sure to ignite a vibrant competitive ecosystem that’ll last until the next Call of Duty game comes around.</p>



<p>Are you going to play Prop Hunt? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-replacer-operator-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-replacer-will-be-in-a-black-ops-6-tracer-pack-from-november-14.1030146/</guid>

<p>We thought it would happen, and Treyarch is delivering. From November 14, The Replacer will surface in Black Ops 6 as a playable operator, being added to the game in a tracer pack named for the character himself. In the weeks leading up to the launch of Black Ops 6, The Replacer was<strong> everywhere</strong>, and it was the most successful part of Activision’s marketing campaign for the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-replace-your-operators">Replace Your Operators</h2>



<p>On November 14, Black Ops 6’s season one update will go live, introducing new maps, modes, weapons, events, and <strong>much </strong>more. One of the most exciting things about the season one patch is the arrival of The Replacer in playable form.</p>



<p>Given his involvement in the marketing campaign before Black OPs 6 hit the market and his long-time connection to the Black Ops series, he’ll likely be a fan-favourite tracer pack purchase as soon as the first season drops.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that he’s being added within a tracer pack bundle, so he won’t be a unique operator. Instead, he’ll <strong>replace </strong>an existing one as a playable skin. So, he’s technically an operator, but kind of isn’t. Similarly, midway through the season, a bizarre, neon-fuelled character named Brightmare will be added, also to replace an existing operator.</p>



<p>The only new operators this season will be Sev (Tier 100) and Goliath (Blackcell).</p>



<p>Black Ops 6’s season one update introduces a huge amount of content, from the new Area 99 resurgence map in Warzone to Prop Hunt in multiplayer. It’s a stacked roadmap for sure.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the first season of Black Ops 6?</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced what's next for Grand Theft Auto Online, and November's updates to the multiplayer game is all about what some believe be the game's best and most exciting feature: <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Heists_in_GTA_Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heists</a>.</p><p>Every week in November will focus on a different GTA Online Heist. This kicks off this week with the Cayo Perico Heist, with more to come throughout the month.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, GTA Online's heists call on players to take part in multi-mission campaigns with the aim of committing a high-profile crime with a lucrative payout.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_The_Cayo_Perico_Heist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cayo Perico heist</a>, which was first released in 2020, has players trekking to the private island of Cayo Perico, fighting against armed guards, and getting away with all the money you can find. Players can take on heists solo or with friends, and coordinating with teammates makes it pretty thrilling.</p><p>November also brings a new Community Challenge, and this one is all about heists, naturally. Rockstar is calling on players to collectively steal $20 trillion worth of in-game cash between now and December 4, and if successful, Rockstar will give out "a vault full of rewards" to players.</p><p>Players who successfully complete the Cayo Perico heist between now and November 13 will earn the Panther Statue, with other rewards to be revealed later for completing more heists in November.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180" data-ratio="0.561850802644" data-width="1059" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180"></a><figcaption>The Panther Statue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png"></figure><p>For more, be sure to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kk3243ka35572/break-into-the-heist-challenge-all-month-long" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Rockstar's full blog post</a> to get up to speed on everything new in GTA Online this week and beyond.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/opnsense-proxmox-diy-router-topton-cwwk-ap-mikrotik<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2020, at the height of covid lockdown, I bought a Netgear RAX 120 router. I considered this a solid investment because it cost a lot of money but I was trapped in my house, thus necessitating a smooth internet experience. Over the years I have come to loathe this router, in part because I have gotten more savvy with networking generally, but mainly because it has slowly started to deteriorate and caused me nothing but grief.</p><figure><figcaption>Several options exist from companies like Protectli, CWWK, Topton, and more. Credit: CWWK, Gowin.</figcaption></figure><p>If you have lived with a mediocre Wi-Fi router, I want to let you know that a better way is possible. Affordable wired routers and access points exist. You can just make your own mesh network, building a router like it was a computer or using premade accessible mini PCs. While it’s more technically complicated than just buying a router, there’s a massive quality of life improvement.</p><h2>Splitting the difference — using Wi-Fi Access points and wired routers</h2><figure><figcaption>I went with Grandstream, although it has its annoyances. People seem to like TP-Link. I tried UniFi and hated using them.</figcaption></figure><p>One reason why I hate consumer Wi-Fi routers is because they’re all-in-one devices. Wi-Fi standards get updated fairly frequently, and combining the router part with the wireless part often leads to an experience that becomes obsolete faster. What’s more, this is often not ideal for getting the best Wi-Fi coverage in your home. And while consumer mesh systems do address this, I prefer to just go with something closer to business or enterprise grade.</p><p>One way you can approach this is by just getting a wired router and using wireless access points to handle the Wi-Fi traffic. You can get a rock solid wired router for 50 bucks if you don’t need to go over a gigabit. For wired products I’m a huge fan of Latvian company Mikrotik. Their RouterOS is as solid as a rock, and they have an endearing YouTube channel. Additionally, you can just make a teensy hardware router using Single Board Computers like the NanoPi, but I’ll get to that later.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="hEX - the most affordable Ethernet router RE-RELEASED" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zrzq_zPWoQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>MikroTik makes really good wired routers that don't break the bank and have a delightful youtube channel. If you don't need more than 1 Gigabit Ethernet, they have a lot of very inexpensive routers. </figcaption></figure></div><p>For wireless access points a lot of people enjoy Unifi by Ubiquiti. I had these in the past and personally do not enjoy them. They exist in a weird zone between enterprise and enthusiast, costing too much to justify the quality of service. The software needed to manage them requires either buying their hardware or running that proprietary software locally on a docker container or Raspberry Pi. This entire process is needlessly annoying. For the same money you can buy access points from companies like Grandstream or TP-Link’s Omada system, which <a href="https://dongknows.com/tp-link-omada-class-diy-mesh-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people seem to like</a> and which offer way more features for your money. You can even buy decommissioned older enterprise hardware from brands like Ruckus, Cisco and Aruba. Older enterprise hardware isn’t going to be the latest and greatest, but it’s solid as a rock.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Finding the BEST Cheap 2.5GbE Switch... by Testing 21 of Them" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pYQvEX9Ct0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2.5 and 10 gigabit network switches have gotten ridiculously cheap. Most people won't take advantage of that kind of performance, but it's gotten so cheap you may as well.  </figcaption></figure></div><p>I ended up going with Grandstream’s access points. Though they have their annoying quirks if you don’t use <a href="https://www.grandstream.com/products/networking-solutions/wi-fi-management/product/gwn-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GWN Manager</a> (I had to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ssh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ssh</a> into one of them to update a firmware URL), they can manage themselves if you prefer that and are an incredible deal for the money. A lot of these access points have PoE (Power of Ethernet), which means they can be powered over the same ethernet cable that transfers data. In the last few years, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network switches</a> have gotten very cheap and fast, and you can often find units that go up to 2.5 GbE and will power all your access points for not a lot of cash. Multiple access points, powered by a network switch, into a wired router can give you fast, reliable coverage for about the price of a high end consumer router or mesh system. Since the individual parts are distinct from each other, you have a better route for upgrading each of those things down the line.</p><h2>Making your router suck less with OpenWRT</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Here's how to make your router BETTER! (OpenWRT)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgOA9oUSpmM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Another path you can take to make your router suck less is, hardware permitting, have it run a different OS, specifically OpenWRT. OpenWRT is a Linux-based OS for embedded devices like routers that provides a standardized, open source and frequently updated platform for your router. This is great in particular if you’d like to repurpose an older Wi-Fi router which is not getting updated as frequently as it used to. Not all routers support OpenWRT, although I wish they did. In my case, there is some experimental support for my cursed Netgear, but<a href="https://openwrt.org/inbox/toh/netgear/netgear_rax120_nighthawk_ax12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> only the V2 model</a>, which I do not have. What’s more, there’s always the potential to brick your router, although if you’re planning on getting rid of it anyway this is a great way to breathe life into an old device.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="NanoPi R5C OpenWRT Router" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GsxuoSXb9A4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>OpenWRT also runs on a variety of devices.

However, over the years since it has been created, other more robust options have come along. <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AdGuard Home</a> is one option, and has a really robust interface and set of filters. If you have kids, it does a great job at blocking adult-oriented traffic across an entire network. There’s also <a href="https://0xerr0r.github.io/blocky/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blocky</a>, which is newer but runs very lean, although it has to be set up on the command line. All of these options are valid ways to rapidly improve your overall network experience with only a little bit of work. If you go down this route using a Raspberry Pi, I personally prefer <a href="https://dietpi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DietPi</a> - an exceedingly lean OS that runs on a variety of single board computers and is a cinch to set up.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pi-hole vs AdguardHome vs Blocky" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rfBh2VVOVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>The invasion of the Mini PCs: Topton/CWWK/Gowin and running ProxMox</h2><figure><figcaption><span>Several options exist from companies like Protectli, CWWK, Topton, and more.

Often featured on the forums and YouTube channel of networking website Serve The Home, these firewall devices seem very similar to offerings from <a href="https://protectli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protectli</a>. They often feature powerful processors for what they are, have a robust amount of I/O for a single device and run on a tiny amount of power. You will often see them from companies like Topton, CWWK, and GoWin.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Best EVER Fanless Mini PCs for Virtualization and Firewalls?" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bM6Ivy_KLR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When it comes to using one of these as a router and firewall, these things are beasts. There are tons of ways to approach this, but two of the most common ones are PfSense and the open source alternative OpnSense (other options include VyOS and Mikrotik’s CHR platform, which are worse as firewalls and better at routing traffic). You can install these directly on the device, or you do what a lot of people do and install them via Proxmox. Proxmox is a virtualization platform that lets you run several virtual machines on the same machine. This means that in addition to running something like OpnSense for traffic, you can run several other things on the same device. This is what I did.</p><p>I decided to go with an Intel N100 based unit from CWWK. You can order these on Aliexpress, Amazon or directly from CWWK, although there are enough horror stories on the STH forums of people who got dud units and the latter is a bit easier when it comes to returns. When I got mine, I threw a 1TB SSD inside of it and 16 gigs of ram. I also made sure to reapply the anemic thermal paste on the unit with Thermalright TF8, which costs next to nothing and wowed reviewer <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/thermalright-tf8-thermal-compound-in-test-new-front-runner-at-the-limit-of-what-is-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Igor’s Lab</a> when compared to higher priced thermal paste.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ultimate Beginner's Guide to OpnSense -  Installation - Part 1" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vJBoCgptF-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There are plenty of great tutorials out there on how to install OpnSense on Proxmox, and I will admit that I ran into some trouble that necessitated calling my ISP. But the process itself, despite being stressful, was very instructive, and now I feel very comfortable running new virtual machines on the device. Both Proxmox and OpnSense have bright, beautiful interfaces, my internet screams now, and the actual service runs so efficiently that I have tons of room left over to run other services on my network.</p><p>Everything in my house is running beautifully now. As I wrote this, I found a wonderful resource – a series of easy-to-use scripts by a user named tteck that automate the process of installing new Linux containers making it as easy as copy/pasting a simple command. I had also found out, suddenly, that tteck has told people that they will no longer be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/1gk19gm/ttecks_proxmoxve_helper_scripts_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintaining the repo due to moving into hospice care</a>. “I have very limited time left on earth. weeks.” Since then, the scripts have a new home: <a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community-Scripts</a>.</p><figure><a href="https://community-scripts.github.io/Proxmox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>The old vs. the new: tteck's contributions are now a community effort.  <a href="https://ko-fi.com/proxmoxhelperscripts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tteck's ko-fi is here</a>, where you can see an outpouring of support.

Without YouTube tutorials or forums like STH, I would not know where to start with building a Proxmox box. OpenWRT is maintained and worked on by volunteers attempting to unfuck the mess left by major companies. People like tteck selflessly maintain scripts even as they get sick. Companies are often not interested in maintaining their hardware unless they are forced to – they are happy to just sell you something that slowly disintegrates until you have to buy something new in a few years.&nbsp;</p><p>I have seen the glimpse of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPL</a> future where things are open, where old routers are given a second life, where things are self-hosted and where everyone has adult tools at their disposal. I want these things to be easy for everyone. These things are built on the sweat equity of nerds everywhere, but when you experience it, you realize it is a beautiful way to live. If we all put our minds to it, none of us have to deal with awful home Wi-Fi ever again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>PlayStation 5 Pro</h5><p><span>November 7th, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>Mid-generation console refreshes are nothing new in the gaming industry. Everything from the pre-market crash Atari 2600 up through just about every Nintendo console to hit the market, console manufacturers have found ways to introduce additional purchases into the lifespan of a console, usually accompanied by a form factor change or addition of new features in the box. The concept of introducing a console that could run all of the very same games but with added performance was something unique to the Sony ecosystem with the PlayStation 4 Pro or Microsoft’s Xbox One X. Companies like Nintendo tried something similar with the New Nintendo 3DS but these introduced games that were exclusive to the upgraded hardware (Xenoblade Chronicles being one of these rare titles). Sony’s PlayStation 5 Pro aims to be the console that can achieve a higher benchmark across all of their titles, but is that boosted flagship console worth the investment if you’re already a next-gen player?<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>What comes in the package is the same usual assortment of parts that Sony has bundled with all of their consoles. To get a deeper look at what's in the package and my powered-off impressions, check out our unboxing article <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-unboxing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. One of the first purchases I will be making this weekend will be to get the external disc drive so I can finally check out the latest Prince of Persia and several other titles from my backlog that I own the discs for and couldn't justify double-dipping on a digital version just to play on this particular piece of hardware. I know I will keep banging the same drum here, but I am really disappointed with Sony's answer to the horizontal stand on the PlayStation 5 Pro. It lacks stability, and nothing short of a hardware update could improve that stability, whether it's a third-party stand or purchasing that disc drive. The vertical stand that Sony provided would work for most people, but given how my consoles are set up directly below my wall-mounted television, there isn't space to have the PlayStation 5 Pro stand upright and not block the screen.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>PlayStation 5 Pro owners won't find a secret menu that gives players superuser access to overhaul the appearance and performance of a given game. Instead, Sony's PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) runs behind the scenes at all times. If players didn't have a list of PS5 Pro Enhanced titles or a base model PS5 sitting side by side, there's a good chance that the secret sauce wouldn't even be visible to the player. For some titles, such as Naughty Dog's The Last of Us, which features a Quality mode that runs at 30 FPS, the same mode running on PlayStation 5 Pro is a significant gameplay boost.</p>
<p>Personally, I found the Quality Mode on PS5 to be sluggish and not as responsive when it mattered most. The same game and graphical mode instead ran much closer to 60FPS, the same performance I was getting out of the aptly named Performance Mode. Right out of the box, for players booting up a PlayStation 5 Pro enhanced title, It Just Works™. One option available to players in the Screen and Video menu is the toggle for 8K Output (which, truth be told, I don’t have a capable display in my office and most likely won’t unless Sony does a massive upgrade to their InZone monitor line).<u></u><u></u></p>
<figure>

<p>Another graphical toggle on the PlayStation 5 Pro is to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-significantly-performance-improvements-game-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhance the image quality for PS4 games</a>. Interestingly, the toggle is disabled when the console is attached to a FullHD display, and the PS5 Pro will advise that this option is only for a display that supports 1440p or 2160p output. This doesn’t seem to be the only way to enhance a last-gen title as I started up Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven to take a peek at the image quality and was quite surprised at how much the console cleaned up and applied anti-aliasing to the character models and environment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a 100% perfect enhancement as some strange artifacts and image warping appeared while I was focused on a particular character’s idle animation and the way the image would bend and partially distort as hair clashed with their helmet, something I hadn’t seen on the same version running on the base PS5. The fact it took me to stop and focus so intently on a specific character to notice a flaw meant that in action, I didn’t see much issue with the native upscaling in actual practice. I intend to revisit some of the other titles in my collection, Persona 5 Strikers for one, to see how much the aliasing and jagged edges I observed while reviewing that title have been addressed with the native PSSR support.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>I touched upon this during my unboxing, but the PlayStation 5 Pro design feels built for the optional disc drive attachment or the vertical stand, at the very least. The two white stand pieces offer a quick and dirty way to lay your PlayStation 5 Pro down horizontally, but with how much it would wobble, there's stability at play here that hurts the presentation and overall aesthetic of Sony's flagship console. Consider investing in something like Sony's vertical stand or the disc drive that'll permit playing the rest of your disc-based library, both of which will add to the total bill to the point of being in the ballpark of simply buying two PlayStation 5 Slim units.<u></u><u></u></p>
<p>It will take some time to dig into and fully appreciate what Sony is bringing to the table with their mid-generation refresh of the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5/ps5-pro/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. With nearly 100 <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-is-an-incredible-feat-of-engineering-says-hello-games-no-mans-sky-8k30fps-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro Enhanced titles</a>, Sony has already shown a big commitment to proving their $699 console refresh is an initial value, but it will take through next year to see what the barriers of entry will be for every developer to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's unique feature set or the automated PSSR running behind the scenes. Many gamers might balk at the premium price tag of the PlayStation 5 Pro or use it as fuel for the ongoing console wars, but it's important to consider its role in the console ecosystem as more along the lines of an upgrade from the base GeForce RTX series to a SUPER. If you're guilty of upgrading your graphics card for $600 or more to achieve ten or fifteen more FPS in Cyberpunk 2077, you already know the value Sony's bringing to the table with the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's Note: Sony provided Wccftech with a PlayStation 5 Pro review unit for editorial purposes.]</em></p>

					
					

<p>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</p>

Now, on the verge of the next set Surging Sparks’ release, it’s a good moment to look at which Stellar Crown cards are getting the most love.</p><p>Things started going odd for the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in January 2024, with Paldean Fates. This special set contained a ridiculous 88 baby shinies, and while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paldean-fates-pokemon-tcg-pull-rates-1851196505">pull-rates felt amazing</a></span>, the sheer volume of cards made it utterly impossible to collect. This was followed by Temporal Forces and Twilight Masquerade, two sets with almost identical card numbers and pull rates, both with a galling one-in-five chance of receiving a secret rare or better. (Even bland ex cards were only appearing in one out of every six packs!) While this appears to be the new norm <em>Pokémon TCG</em> in the Scarlet &amp; Violet era (and looks set to continue with November’s Surging Sparks), it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-value-crown-zenith-paldea-evolved-1850552711">still hard not to hark back to the joy of sets like Crown Zenith</a></span>, and wish for better.</p><p>So it was even more galling when August’s “special” set, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-shrouded-fable-pull-rate-1851611684">Shrouded Fable, then bemused everyone</a></span> by featuring the lowest number of cards since the desultory <em>Pokémon Go </em>set in 2022, <em>and</em> making the good ones nightmarishly hard to find. Boy, did everyone get a lot of the same bulk.</p><p>So then came September’s Stellar Crown, and while the pull rates still sat at a sulk-inducing 20 percent, it sat at a sweet spot for size. A Goldilocks set, if you will. With a total of 175 cards, rather than the 220+ that had become the norm (and be warned, Surging Sparks has a deranged 252, with an eye-watering 191 of them before the secret rares start), it feels manageable, collectible, and most importantly, is packed with completely gorgeous cards.</p><p>Here are the cards fetching the highest prices, whether for the meta, or just because they’re so very pretty.

That was usually because the art was always so muted, compared to other versions in a set, and that the market was saturated. However, this year the three-star rarity seems to have gained a bit more traction again, and this card’s fetching almost <strong>$22</strong>, two months after release.</p><p>This is then boosted by Terapagos’s arrival in the TCG via Stellar Crown, and this card’s wild power when combined with that Area Zero Underdepths Stadium. 30 damage per card on your bench, with a possible eight cards total, means a whopping 240 attack just for two Energy. It’s a card so powerful it adds the caveat that you can’t use it on your turn in the first round.</p><p>But then it goes even further, offering a 180 attack with a follow-up that Basic Pokémon can’t damage it in the next turn, albeit for the tricky requirement of a Grass, Water <em>and</em> Lightning energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-recommend-id="image://aae3c16cc5ada16aee4da81b018ec8c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Briar Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I guess put this down to the ol’ <em>PTCG </em>tradition of any card with a full-art female character fetching bigger prices.</p><p>Sure, it’s an interesting Trainer, letting you take an extra Prize Card under extremely specific circumstances, but you know.

Yet here it is, in third place, with an asking price of <strong>$40</strong> for a small piece of cardboard.</p><p>It certainly helps that Orca’s art is utterly stunning, yet another example of how it’s inexplicable madness that The Pokémon Company doesn’t sell poster-sized versions of these art works in its stores. I’d put this on the wall in an instant.</p><p>As a card for your deck, it’s nothing special. It’s nice that it adds a 20HP heal to its 20 attack, but that comes at the cost of needing two Energy for a Basic card with such low damage.

That’s taking nothing away from artist Saborteri, because this too is gorgeous.</p><p>It’s not often you see two different attacks on a Basic card like Squirtle, so that one-Energy 50:50 chance of preventing damage is a useful device if you’re forced to start this in your Active Spot, before being able to evolve.

(Which, by the way, has seen a recent revival, currently going for $400 or more.) This is a more subtle affair, though, and I think tempered by its rather twee pastel vibes, but that’s not holding it back much. This card is still, two months on, fetching over <strong>$94</strong>.</p><p>Make sure to enlarge that image above to appreciate the incredible effort from artist Saboteri (yup, the same person responsible for the Squirtle!).</p><p>That price is a fair chunk down from its initial high of $150, and part of a more gradual decline following its initial plunge to $115. Will it level out, or continue dropping? I sort of suspect the latter, and imagine this’ll find its base at around $60. Cards of this much artistic complexity tend to keep more value, but it’s hard to argue that Terapagos has gained some sort of mass fan adoration in the way Giratina can claim. It is, after all, a hairy turtle.</p><p>In play, this card is exactly the same as the gold version at the start of this list, as indeed is the $8 Double Rare version. Although, given its popularity in the meta, you won’t find it cheaper than that for the moment.</p><p>Still, at more than double anything else in the set, this is clearly the card to pull from Stellar Crown. Get it graded at a PSA 10 and that price goes up to $334.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-creator-says-its-time-for-aaa-studios-to-move-away-from-safe-bets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 15-person team behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-team-put-on-redundancy-notice-amid-funding-struggles"><u>recently put on notice</u></a>, following struggles to find funding for their next project. But Surgent Studios isn’t shutting down, its staff aren’t gone forever, and it’s not asleep at the wheel, according to its founder, Abubakar Salim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They are, he says, “literally raring” to go the second money comes in, like a “cocked gun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We still have so much more to say and so much more to build on,” Salim tells IGN. “And the audiences that we've already started to build as well, and the players and the people who want to champion us, they want to hear more…We are ready. We're so ready. It is just about taking that leap of faith with us.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Leap of Faith</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s the leap of faith? It’s called Project Uso, and it’s a single-player, isometric, Afro-gothic action RPG. You play as a vampiric android containing the spirit of Eshu, the Yoruba god of chaos. As Salim explains, the idea is to explore the idea of two minds in one body through the mechanics of tabletop RPGs. But rather than rolling against a dungeon master, in Project Uso, the player sometimes must roll against themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Project Uso is about the concept of identity, with Uso meaning “face” in Swahili. It’s inspired by Salim’s exploration of his own dual nature in the wake of his daughter’s birth. While ZAU was about who he is <em>without</em> a parent, Salim says that Uso is about asking who he is <em>as</em> a parent.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Uso Early Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a parent, I always used to find myself being like, I love my daughter, cleaning her dirty nappy. I also want to go see my mates to the cinema, go outside with my mates or whatever. You know what I mean? There's a battle of freedoms here. And there's that sense of, do I do this or do I do that? Or even when I'm talking to my daughter and I'm making choices, how do I make sure that she listens to me? Am I strict or am I soft? You are having this battle within you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim is candid that he’s relatively new to game development. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was the first game he’s made, having come into the industry from acting. He’s best known in gaming spaces as Bayek in Assassin’s Creed: Origins, and has held a number of other gaming roles since then in addition to his numerous film and TV acting credits (including the most recent season of House of the Dragon). But the last four years of working on ZAU have been a learning experience for him, particularly in how games are typically funded.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I've learned is that mainly when you get funding for a game, that funding is really there to get you to launch and maybe just a bit more after,” he says. “Maybe. And you are supposed to have your next project turned up and done and signed either before you've even launched the first game or maybe just afterwards. That gap in between is frightening because you can see that coming like a train.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this, he explains. While gaming companies briefly poured funding into new projects, there’s been an industry-wide wake-up call in the last two years resultings in mass layoffs, financial struggles, and funding drying up. As a result, Salim explains that companies have become far more cautious in the bets they’re willing to make on new games. That includes EA, whose EA Originals label published Tales of Kenzera: ZAU but which hasn’t picked up Salim’s next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim says he understands, but doesn’t agree that it’s the best strategy. On the contrary, he thinks now is the time for companies to take risks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why would I, as a player of Call of Duty or as Fortnite, want to leave that to go to something new when I've already established myself in this space?” he says. “I totally understand that. It's like going to your favorite cafe or going to your favorite restaurant. The way that you entice people to go to somewhere different and somewhere new is by doing something different or something new, by being bold, by being creative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think a great example of this is Animal Well. You look at Animal Well and it's completely unexpected. You didn't know what you were getting into. And that was a risk that was taken by a YouTuber. I think we need to see more of that from people in positions of power and in positions of stability.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bouncing Back</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Surgent Studios and Salim have had a rough time finding funding for Project Uso, but there’s been another layer to their struggles: harassment. Tales of Kenzera: ZAU has found itself the target of ongoing, racist attacks online, largely targeting the game for its Black protagonist and its Bantu inspirations. But none of this has discouraged Salim from pitching Project Uso. On the contrary, he’s of the belief that it’s important to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-director-addresses-constant-targeted-harassment-lowers-price-of-game-on-switch"><u>address such attacks directly</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think that the anti-diversity, equity, inclusion sort of movement, it's about not having the right information,” he says. “I think we are seeing a lot of gaps being filled with conspiracy theories, like ticking boxes and all this sort of stuff, which isn't actually true when you look into it. And that dialogue needs to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salim acknowledges that directly speaking with harassers can be dangerous, and isn’t for everyone. Both parties, he says, have to come to the discussion in good faith, and harassers often don’t. But he believes such engagement can change hearts and minds, and is worth doing for those able. And on a higher level, he adds, companies have a responsibility to take even firmer action against harassment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is definitely a fear of having a stance, I feel, when it comes to businesses. They kind of want to be neutral, which again, totally understand. But there is a level where it goes a bit too far…We're in a time right now where someone can post a YouTube video and say my garb is like a Rafiki outfit and call my studio Spear-Chucker Studios, and I don't know whether there's going to be repercussions or not. I have to call them out on it. And it's like, come on. It should be down to the [company], be it YouTube, or be it Twitch, or be it even Valve, for example, to be like, ‘Yeah, that's not cool. Get out.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Surgent Studios is currently in a holding pattern with Project Uso, Salim has faith that the industry will bounce back from its rough patch, and he’ll bounce back with them. He believes that while video games are both art and business, they are art first and foremost, and “the arts always survive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The beauty though, about games, I feel, is that the conversation and dialogue is a lot more open,” he says. “And so I feel that bouncing back can happen sooner and bolder and more brilliant than any other art form. And that's what gets me, that's what inspires me. That's what kind of drives me to continue going on even after everything that's happened. Because it's a beautiful space to be in. It really is. And don't get me wrong, the amount of times I've wanted to be like, ‘I should just stay as an actor, man. I'm in a big TV show. I should just be really comfortable here and just doing my thing here.’ But there is something inside me that just says, ‘Nah, man, I wouldn't be happy. That's just not enough.’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

This comes in a game which has 32 total leaders (before the third set adds another 18 tomorrow), meaning Boba Fett should represent just 3% or 4% of the winners if everything was balanced well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boba Fett was banned altogether because it's "clean and easy to understand; it’s timely, in that we can take immediate action when problems arise; and it’s precise, allowing us to target only the most problematic cards without collateral damage elsewhere," Schaefer said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He called the card "the most severe power level outlier" and said a ban of supporting cards instead wouldn't work becasue Boba Fett is powerful enough to dominate with their replacements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players quickly noticed the huge power disparity in Boba Fett. Like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, and several other trading card games, Star Wars Unlimited relies on mana generation and management.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means players slowly amass an increasingly large pool of mana over the course of the game, using it to play more and more powerful cards. Any card that can generate extra mana or recover used mana is therefore incredibly powerful, and Boba Fett did just that.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/boba-1730998151694.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all though, as Boba Fett could be deployed with just five mana himself despite having high stats more equitable to a leader that deployed at six resources. Boba Fett is also the only hero to have multiple support cards designed to work with it specifically, with cards such as Fire Spray and Boba Fett's armor boosting it even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Unlimited players will therefore have mixed feelings about its banning. Many, if not most, competitive players will have lost their main deck, but many others will be relieved the meta will balance out a touch by Boba Fett's banning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The competitive scene will also enjoy a boost through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-tcgs-twilight-of-the-republic-decks-spotlight-ahsoka-and-general-grievous">the release of the aforementioned third set, Twilight of the Republic</a>, which brings new heroes such as Ahsoka from The Clone Wars and General Grievous from Star Wars: Episode 3 - Revenge of the Sith.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-unlimited-card-game-review">In our 7/10 review of the base game</a>, IGN said: "Star Wars Unlimited delivers a solid core game, with plenty of opportunities to look at deck building strategy and in-game tactics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After admitting its video games business “is substantially underperforming its potential right now,” Warner Bros. has said it plans to double down on four key titles, namechecking Batman in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2024 has been a brutal year for Warner Bros. Games, with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure sparking a $200 million hit to revenue, and then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-admits-multiversus-underperformed-contributing-to-another-100-million-hit-to-revenue-in-its-games-business">Smash Bros.-style brawler MultiVersus flopping to the tune of $100 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a total writedown of over $300 million in Warner Bros.’ games business so far in 2024, and it doesn’t look like the company has a game coming out any time soon that will reverse the trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the plan? During a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, the company plans to double down on just four titles, and significantly reduce the number of video games it releases in the process.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those games are Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC “in particular Batman,” Zaslav added.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Batman: Arkham Shadow Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re through some of the worst — and it hasn't been pretty on the gaming business — but we have four games that are really powerful and have a real constituency that love them, and we’re going to focus on those four primarily,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re going to go away from trying to launch 10, 12, 15, 20 different games. I think we have a real chance now with focus to have the gaming business be steadier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have four strong and profitable game franchises with loyal, global fans: Hogwarts Legacy, Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC in particular Batman. We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The obvious highlight there is Batman. Controversial live service looter shooter Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League’s failure was in part due to it not being yet another single-player Batman Arkham game, which developer Rocksteady is best-known for. Warner Bros. Games just released a VR-exclusive Batman Arkham game. Could Rocksteady now be set to return to Batman after Suicide Squad’s struggles?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> reported that staff at Rocksteady were currently working on a director’s cut of the phenomenally successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy"><u>Hogwarts Legacy</u></a>, while leadership pitches a return to single-player following its live service misstep. Could that pitch have involved Batman, and been successful?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before we find out. In the shorter term, Warner Bros. has confirmed development on a Hogwarts Legacy sequel and it has a Wonder Woman game in the works at Monolith Productions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetherRealm’s Mortal Kombat 1 released in September last year, and fans are wondering what it’s up to next. In September, NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago">the studio had decided on its next game three years ago</a>, but insisted it was “still fully committed to supporting Mortal Kombat 1 for a long time to come.” Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor owner and publisher Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

However, as long as you follow the steps below, you'll have a tamed cat in no time:</p><ul><li>First, you need to find a cat, which most commonly spawn in villages. Once you find a cat, approach them extremely carefully. Any sudden movements and the cat will run away. You also want to ensure you're crouching.</li><li>While you're approaching the cat slowly, have a raw cod or raw salmon in your hand. This makes the cat less likely to run away.</li><li>After you're close enough to the cat, feed the raw cod or salmon to it.

If the frog finds a suitable spot, they will lay a spawn that soon hatches into tadpoles.</li><li>The tadpoles then develop into baby frogs after some time.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375263-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.54.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375263" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375263-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.54.70.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375263"></a><figcaption>Frogs breeding in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375263-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.54.70.png"></figure><p>Breeding frogs can take longer than other animals, as the pregnant frog has to find the right spot to lay the spawn, but it shouldn't take too long if you're in a swamp.</p><h2 id="How_to_breed_Turtles_in_Minecraft">How to breed Turtles in Minecraft</h2><p>Turtles are notoriously difficult to breed in Minecraft.

            <p>
Two years after its PC launch and a little over a year since its arrival on Xbox Series X/S, co-op-focused first-person action shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> finally has a PlayStation 5 release date, and is set to be available from 3rd December.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is the work of developer Fatshark, the team behind the acclaimed Warhammer: Vermintide series. It's described as a "spritual successor" to those earlier games, and while it has a similar focus on four-player co-op action, it trades the brutal melee combat of its predecessors for meaty gunplay.
</p>
<p>
"In the depths of the hive," Fatshark explains, "the seeds of corruption threaten to turn into an overwhelming tide of darkness. A mysterious and sinister new force is seeking to take control of the entire city. It is up to you and your allies in the Inquisition to root out the enemy before the city succumbs to Chaos. As Tertium falls, Rejects Will Rise."

<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell liked Darktide a lot when it launched for PC back in 2022, celebrating its "stupendous atmosphere and vicious action" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-darktide-review-a-horde-of-minor-flaws-can-be-overcome-by-faith">his Recommended review</a>, despite some niggling launch issues. "This great hive of action lives by its vampiric atmosphere," he wrote, "its booming, eviscerating, and just apocalyptically scaled take on grimdark violence. That, and by the grace of the Emperor's mercy."
</p><p>
Warhammer 40,000: Darktide will <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469/">cost £32.99 via the PlayStation Store</a> when it launches on 3rd December, and there's 10 percent off for PlayStation Plus subscribers, bringing the price down to £29.69. Additionally, anyone that pre-orders can start playing six days early.
