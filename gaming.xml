            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's October release date is inching ever closer, with Activision growing looser-lipped by the day. Which brings us to the company's latest reveal: a first look at Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, courtesy of a two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, ahead of a full gameplay breakdown this Thursday, 8th August.
</p>
<p>
"After being imprisoned for over five years at a remote outpost in the Philippine Sea, the former members of Requiem stage a daring breakout," explains Activision in a bout of scene-setting <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-lost-soul-requiem-terminus-team-intel">over on the Call of Duty blog</a>. "They are aided by the unexpected arrival of a mysterious Filipina smuggler and a former adversary. Unfortunately, their bid for freedom from Terminus Island coincides with another chaotic dimensional outbreak... Welcome to Black Ops 6 Zombies."
</p>
<p>
That daring breakout is what we see in Black Ops 6 Zombies' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z0Ni2JIqzw">first cinematic trailer</a>, which introduces the mode's new characters - former Requiem stuff members Grigori Weaver, Mackenzie "Mac" Carver, Elizabeth Grey, Oskar Strauss, and Stoney Maddox (AKA Raptor One) - alongside their liberators, Maya Aguinaldo and Dr. William Peck.
</p>

<p>
There's a bit more detail on each of the characters in Activision's announcement post, but the key takeaway is Black Ops 6 Zombies continues the Dark Aether storyline, picking up five years after Requiem's senior staff were arrested by Project Director Edward Richtofen. But Activision notes it's not just the Terminus Island outpost that's about to be overrun with undead: the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls, on the other side of the world, is also facing its own zombie outbreak.
</p>
<p>
So that's your story, but what about gameplay? As it happens, Activision will be sharing the juicy stuff very soon. It'll be updating its blog this Thursday, 8th August, with a post from Zombies developer Treyarch, promising an "in-depth gameplay overview, information about your pre-match preparation options, full details on Round-Based Zombies gameplay, and a bestiary of the undead."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 25th October. It'll be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">day one release on Game Pass</a> too - but, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">Microsoft announced last month</a>, not if you're on the subscription service's revised basic tier.

The release featured a brand new cooperative horde mode called Onslaught and a returning set of weapons called the BRAVE arsenal. At the time, you could “attune” to the weapons of the arsenal, making it easier to grind them and get the most ideal combination of weapon perks, or a god roll.</p><p>The release of <em>The Final Shape </em>regrettably stripped some features introduced with <em>Into the Light</em>, including the ability to attune to BRAVE weapons. Thankfully, Bungie is bringing it back after being gone from the game for a few months, and it’ll even be a bit better than before. As of patch 8.0.5, whose full patch notes can be seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_2_update_805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/destiny_2_update_805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>, <strong>attunement can now be accomplished by talking to Zavala in the Tower</strong>.</p><p><strong>If you go up and talk to Zavala at his usual spot overlooking the Last City now, the bottom-most tab on his menu features attunement</strong>. Clicking on the icon, which is labeled as “Onslaught Attunement,” now shows all of the BRAVE arsenal, which can only be earned by playing the eponymous mode. Interestingly, the mode-specific labeling could suggest that Bungie <em>might</em> add ways to attune to weapons tied to other ritual activities, such as Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, and maybe even dungeons and raids in the future. Time, of course, will tell.</p><p>Otherwise, the attunement system will function much the same as it did in <em>Into the Light</em>. <strong>Players will only be able to attune to a single weapon at a time</strong>, but upon attunement, they should notice a significant uptick in the weapon’s drop rate. According to Bungie, <strong>attuned weapons will have their drop rate increased by 60 percent, </strong>which is up from 50 when the feature was first introduced in <em>Into The Light. </em>So it should actually be <em>even</em> easier to pick up any weapons that players may be missing.</p><p>Besides that, BRAVE weapon attunement appears like it’ll function largely the same. The caveat there being that <strong>BRAVE weapon attunement will only impact drop rates within Onslaught</strong>, the cooperative horde mode introduced alongside the arsenal. If you were looking for a reason to mindlessly shoot scores of aliens, you now have a way better chance of getting a god roll Recluse than you’ve ever really had before.</p><p>With that being said, it’s time to attune to your favorite weapons and get to grinding. This latest patch also brings back the Solstice seasonal event, meaning there’s plenty of fresh activities to break in your new BRAVE weapons and even better loot waiting at the end of it all. If that weren’t enough, we’re also <em>still</em> in the middle of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s first episode “Echoes,” and while Saint-14 is clearly haunted by whatever’s happening to him, there are some very cool Battlegrounds to fight through and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-echoes-planetary-piston-hammers-1851613479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-echoes-planetary-piston-hammers-1851613479">great gear to collect</a></span>.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epyx-summer-olympics-paris-2024-c64<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my earliest video gaming memories is destroying my young body playing <em>Summer Games</em>, released in 1984 for pretty much every home computer available at the time.</p><p>I remember being four years old playing it on my grandparent's brand new Commodore 64 and, being a stupid kid who couldn't read properly yet, glossing over what little text the game put in front of me. For example: the first thing it asks you to do is pick which country you're playing as. I, being a kid, would scan this screen going "uh huh, France, Britain, Canada, Mexico and...Egypt".</p><figure></figure><p>I could read, but I've always had a tendency to speed-read/gloss over things. If I'd taken time to spell that out I'm sure I would have noticed that it read "Epyx". But within the context of an international sporting event video game's menu screen, alongside a bunch of actual countries and their actual flags, my brain read the outline of the word, thought it was "Egypt", then went about its business. For <em>years</em>.</p><p>There is of course no such country as Epyx; that's the name of the studio responsible for the game, as well as a succession of other 1980's classics like <em>Barbarian </em>and <em>California Games</em>. In hindsight, it's pretty funny Epyx put themselves into the game to such an extent. But I didn't know that at the time, and so almost as often as I'd choose a real country I'd choose Epyx, because damn, their flag looked <em>amazing</em>.</p><p>Also amazing: the Epyx national anthem. Because why make a fake country for the Olympics if you aren’t also going to give it a banger of an anthem:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Summer Games (Commodore 64) - Epyx anthem" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrgqaqLJ7iE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I didn't have access to this game at home, only at my grandparents’ house, and they lived four hours away, so I'd only end up playing this game once or twice a year. Enough to stay familiar with it (and get <em>really </em>good at it), but obviously not enough to correct my glaring geopolitical fuckup.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when, while coincidentally visiting their house during the opening ceremony for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, I saw "Egypt" parade past the crowds with a flag that did not feature a kneeling statue, nor a nightclub-inspired colour scheme. Perplexed, I ran to the C64, fired up the game and...ah. Ah shit.</p><p>This was pretty embarrassing for a kid who was now eight years old, and should have known the difference between a video game developer and a <em>civilization that stretches back thousands of years</em>. That shame didn't last, though; next time I actually played the game I proudly selected Epyx, and every time the Olympics rolls around in the real world I still think of them fondly.</p><p>Even in 2024, <em>40 years</em> after I first played the game, I thought of Epyx as I watched the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics. Imagined representatives of their team huddled in the rain atop a ferry making its way down the Seine. Dreamt of hearing their stirring anthem blaring loudly from the aquatic centre's loudspeakers after winning relay gold. Pictured the headlines in the Epyx Tribune back home, a nation proud of its athletes, who may not have won as many gold medals as the traditional powerhouses, but whose flag and anthem were at least the <em>coolest</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Between its animated adaptations and video game collaborations - which so far includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-will-let-you-play-as-richter-belmont">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-castlevania-collaboration-coming-to-vampire-survival-game-v-rising-in-may">V Rising</a> - Konami's legendary Castlevania series is alive and well and shows no signs of stopping (although an actual new game would also be nice, Konami). And up next is Dead by Daylight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-adding-dungeons-dragons-and-castlevania-chapters-this-year">previously announced</a> Castlevania chapter, which is now confirmed to be launching on 27th August, with a public test build arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Castlevania's Dead by Daylight colloboration sees Dracula joining the asymmetrical multiplayer horror game as a new Killer, and he'll be accompanied his power-granting castle, as both are "inextricably linked". Developer Behaviour Interactive notes any time Dracula is the featured Killer in a trial with an original map, players will see his castle looming over proceedings.
</p>
<p>
Dracula is officially Dead by Daylight's first shape-shifting Killer, and is able to transform into a bat and wolf alongside his vampire form. The bat is "quiet as a creeping shadow" and can gain ground "with a blink", which, more practically means bat-Dracula has the Undetectable status effect, can move faster, ignore vault points, and teleport to any vault points within 32 meters. Survivors become invisible, but their scratch marks can be seen.

<p>
Dracula's wolf form, meanwhile, has increased movement speed and a "keen nose for fresh blood". Which is to say, pools and scratch marks are more apparent, and Survivors leave a trail of Scent Orbs behind them - which can be collected to charge a powerful pounce attack. And in vampire form, Dracula can cast the Hellfire spell, creating pillars of flame ahead of him or across low obstacles, that "sear flesh and render bone to ash".
</p>
<p>
Dracula - who comes with the Wretched Fate, Human Greed, and Dominance perks, as detailed in <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/465">Dead by Daylight's latest public test build release notes</a> - is joined by a new survivor, vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, first seen in 1989's Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse. Trevor's Eyes of Belmont perk reveals the Killer for a set amount of time when a generator is completed, and his Exultation perk upgrades a held item rarity to the next tier whenever a Killer is stunned with a pallet. And finally, there's his Moment of Glory perk, which activates after opening or rummaging through two chests and automatically heals one health state when injured after a set amount of time.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's Castlevania Chapter is available now for public testing on PC, but it'll get its full release across all platforms on 27th August, when it'll cost around $7.99 USD.

Grinding to the end game of Season of the Infernal Hordes should be a breeze. It remains to be seen how players fair against the new horde mode bosses. There’s two months to master them before <em>Diablo IV</em>’s<em> Vessel of Hatred</em> expansion drops in October. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Agent Samantha Maxis sacrificed herself to essentially seal this twisted dimension from the inside. Worse was to follow, as Requiem’s senior staff members were unceremoniously arrested on the orders of the Project Director—finally revealed to be none other than Edward Richtofen.</p><p>Taking place over half a decade later, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Zombies continues the Dark Aether storyline, exploring the fortunes of key characters while also delving further into Richtofen’s motivations and goals.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>During the intervening years, former Requiem staff—Grigori Weaver, Mackenzie “Mac” Carver, Elizabeth Grey, Oskar Strauss, and Stoney Maddox (better known by his callsign, Raptor One)—have been incarcerated at an outpost known as Terminus, a mysterious garrison located in the Philippine Sea.</p><p>After being imprisoned for over five years, these characters have undergone significant mental and physical changes.</p><p><strong>Operators and Handlers: Meet the Terminus Team</strong></p><p>As a longstanding veteran of the broader <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> storyline, Grigori Weaver is no stranger to the ever-evolving nature of war and conflict—and the gray area it frequently inhabits. Despite the guilt he feels for his perceived “failure” as the team’s commander, he is more than determined to confront and expose his former Director’s duplicity and agendas—whatever they may be. He’s done playing politics and is willing to burn the whole house down to expose the corruption that has led them to their current situation.</p><p>Elizabeth Grey is no longer the meek and somewhat naive scientist who was so thrilled to be invited to work with Requiem that she was somewhat blind to the realities of the Dark Aether threat… and the dubious ethics of those who sought to control its power. These qualities had already changed with the loss of Samatha Maxis, but the injustice of her imprisonment brought out a tougher side she never even knew existed within her. Thanks to Carver’s mentorship and training, her transformation has made her more than capable of facing any threat head on.</p><p>For Carver, his lifelong belief in the military—not to mention his own distinguished career—has been shattered. He is understandably aggrieved, but not bitter. On the surface, it may seem that he has “run out of to give,” but instead he is more dedicated to his friends and colleagues than ever, and believes that with determination, they will right this terrible injustice.</p><p>As for Strauss, not only has he not fared well under the strain of incarceration and intense interrogation, his age and increasingly eccentric personality mean he is deeply reliant on his colleagues—not just for his own physical wellbeing, but also his sanity.</p><p>Events take an explosive turn when Maya Aguinaldo, a young Filipina smuggler, arrives on the island in pursuit of her own (and very personal) agenda related to the disappearance of her own brother. More significantly for our team, she is accompanied by a familiar, but far from welcome face…</p><p>There are many profanities that could be used to describe Dr. William Peck, but even the most offensive ones would fail to adequately do justice to just how detestable he is in the eyes of our heroes.</p><p><strong>Aetheric Incursions: An Outpost Overrun</strong></p><p>Even though Aguinaldo and Peck are primarily here to set our heroes free, their arrival coincides with Terminus Island suddenly becoming the epicenter of yet another outbreak. Consequently, suspicions are high.</p><p>Not only that, but it soon becomes clear that the chaos on Terminus is not the only incursion from the Dark Aether. On the other side of the globe, the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls is also facing its own zombie onslaught.</p><p><a title="Series > Persona [81 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l grievances and suspicions aside, their dire circumstances mean that this disparate group of battle-hardened heroes has little choice but to fight together if they are to have any chance of <a title="Genres > Survival [299 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a>…</p><p><strong>■ Get Ready: Extensive Zombies Intel Comms Incoming!</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20240808T1500" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August 8. 8:00 a.m. PT / 11:00 a.m. ET</a>.</p><p>Return to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> Blog</a> at the time indicated to secure everything you need to know about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Zombies.</p><p>Expect extensive comms direct from the Treyarch Zombies Team, including an in-depth gameplay overview, information about your pre-match preparation options, full details on Round-Based Zombies gameplay, and a bestiary of the undead.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sure, the market for pocket-sized collectibles might be fierce, but Nendoroid has made a name for itself as it continues to add to its customizable lineup of posable figures.

Not only are they cute and impressively detailed, they're also <em>hilarious </em>thanks to one of the optional extra parts included with them. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait until August 13, 2025 to get your order, but preorders have already sold out numerous times at Amazon.

While you won't get a low-poly face to swap the default one out with, you will get a spare face-plate designed by Metal Gear Solid's legendary illustrator, Yoji Shinkawa. You'll also get a sidearm, an assault rifle, a cardboard box for sneaking, and a naked body to put Raiden's head on, for when you want to recreate one of the more bizarre scenes of Metal Gear Solid 2. Like Solid Snake, this figure also includes special articulation to help it strike a prone pose.</p><p>For some great--and more immediate--bargains, you can do some retail therapy at GameStop with its <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3D30056&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fb1g1-free-star-wars-electronic-helmets-zelda-collectibles-and-more%2F1100-6525530%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1722964438853cgj" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy one, get one free sale on collectibles</a> this week.

                <p>Developer Thunderful's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steamworld-heist-ii/">SteamWorld Heist 2</a> releases on August 8, introducing itself as the sequel to the beloved first entry. Almost a decade later since the original's launch in 2015, SteamWorld Heist 2 goes all in on the pirate theme, inviting you to maintain a crew and prepare them for real-time naval combat and the classic turn-based action of its predecessor.</p><p>As the crew's captain, you're tasked with customizing a band of characters with different abilities and weapons to survive all sorts of challenges. Outside of turn-based encounters, you set sail from a top-down perspective to raid enemy outposts and seize loot from hostile ships.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Steamworld Heist 2 Expands The Steam Universe | GameSpot Summer Live</p>
      </div>
<p>Reviewer Steve Watts wrote in his GameSpot's SteamWorld Heist 2 review that "like the first game, SteamWorld Heist 2 defies easy categorization, as it really only plays like itself."</p><p>Watts was also impressed by the way the sequel's systems synergize with each other, while also remaining easily understandable without overwhelming the player. "Like a well-crafted Steambot, each part and gear of SteamWorld Heist 2 attaches just-so to another, with every piece of the device contributing and feeding into the function of two or three other parts. The result is a game that plays with clockwork precision from start to finish," Watts added.</p><p>Check out more reviews for the game below:</p><h2 dir="ltr">IGN -- 8/10</h2><p dir="ltr">"SteamWorld Heist 2’s charming adventure refines the original game’s clever turn-based combat with a flexible mix-and-match class system and handmade maps that are built around using teamwork to accomplish their objectives and escape unscathed." -- <em>Dan Stapleton</em> [<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steamworld-heist-2-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2 dir="ltr">Eurogamer -- 3/5</h2><p dir="ltr">"The core of what I loved about the original is still very much present and correct, and in those moments, Heist 2 wipes that near-decade absence clean again. But there's no denying you can see the machinery straining beneath the surface this time." -- <em>Katharine Castle</em> [<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steamworld-heist-2-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2 dir="ltr">TheGamer -- 3.5/5</h2><p dir="ltr">"While it's true that there are new systems in place that address the prior shortcomings, those new systems also add flaws of their own. Heist 2 introduces a job system that allows you to assign your characters to any class based on their equipped weapon and over time develop them into completely customizable cross-class fighters. It’s a cool way to approach skill trees that gives you a lot of freedom to build your characters with the exact skills you want - but only if you’re willing to grind for it." -- <em>Eric Switzer</em> [<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/steamworld-heist-2-review-high-seas-strategies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2 dir="ltr">PCGamer -- 81/100</h2><p dir="ltr">"If there's one concept that's infinitely more exciting in a videogame than it is in real life, it's taking on multiple jobs at once. That's SteamWorld Heist 2's biggest new innovation—its industrious robot protagonists can now switch freely between different battlefield roles, and combine abilities unlocked in each together. Though there are only six jobs in total, there's an impressive depth to the amount of different possible combinations, especially compared to the fixed classes of the first game. That's emblematic of a sequel that expands on its predecessor in almost every way—and stands out as easily the most ambitious SteamWorld game yet." -- <em>Robin Valentine</em> [<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/steamworld-heist-2-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2 dir="ltr">GamesRadar+ -- 3.5/5</h2><p dir="ltr">"SteamWorld Heist 2 is a great sequel. While retaining the aiming system and side-on perspective that made the original a joy, it features a generously redesigned class system and new overworld to explore. However, old problems with mission repetition and stingy XP rewards deter you from experimenting with classes, pulling the game down from excellence." -- <em>Julian Benson</em> [<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/steamworld-heist-2-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/6/24214608/star-wars-jedi-survivor-xbox-one-ps4-preorder<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor </em>is officially <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi/jedi-survivor">available for preorder</a> for<strong> </strong>the Xbox One and PS4 ahead of a September 17th launch, <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/STAR-WARS-Jedi-Survivor-/STAR-WARS-Jedi-Survivor--Preorder-information-for-Xbox-One-and/td-p/13936532">EA announced today</a>. The game, which arrived on PC and current-gen consoles in April 2023, costs<strong> </strong>$49.99 on Xbox One and PS4, standard edition only — the<strong> </strong>deluxe version is still reserved<strong> </strong>for newer consoles<strong> </strong>and PCs.</p><p>Owners of last-gen consoles<strong> </strong>may want to hold off on the <em>Jedi: Fallen Order </em>sequel for now, though. Although it’s been <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-jedi-survivor/">generally liked by critics</a>, the game has also been panned for performance issues, particularly the PC port. Things have <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLH_HbgzUKBU">improved</a> on the Xbox and PS5 side, but players continue to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1774580/reviews/?browsefilter=mostrecent&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">complain about the PC version’s performance</a>. </p><p>Still, early issues with the current console versions (and ongoing ones for the PC port) don’t mean the Xbox One and PS4 editions will suffer the same fate, and people who played <em>Fallen Order </em>on those consoles might be in for a treat. As <em>The Verge</em>’s Andrew Webster wrote in his review, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc">no better <em>Star Wars </em>wish fulfillment</a>, even if the sequel doesn’t add much new stuff. As someone who’s still working his way through <em>Fallen Order </em>and is really enjoying it, I’ll gladly take more of the same.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
