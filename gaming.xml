            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/21/empyreal-looks-like-a-stunning-new-indie-action-rpg/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There seems to be a major movement towards bigger, bolder indie RPGs right now, that push the boundaries of what we should expect in the indie space. We’ve just had the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/eternal-strands-review/">Eternal Strands</a>, and now Empyreal is heading towards launch on the 8th of May. The development team at Silent Games is keen to give players an early glimpse of the game, and to help them understand the world and some of the systems that they’ll encounter so they’ve dropped an all-new overview trailer with a heap of detail to dispense.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>In the seven-minute Game Overview video, creative director Joseph Rogers delves into the game’s key mechanics and narrative. You can learn more about the stories waiting to be told, the myriad ways to build your character, and how the mysterious Cartograms will affect every journey into the belly of the Monolith.</p>
<p>Empyreal is described as a feature-rich action RPG where players explore an imposing Monolith and fight to survive against the guardians that lie within. Uncover a complex narrative combining mythology, philosophy, and transcendental revelations as you lead an Expedition further into the structure to discover the truth that lies at its core. There’s already a demo available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/">PC players via Steam</a>, so if you fancy checking it out early, you can!</p>

<p>The main features of the game are a unique and complex combat system, a memorable cast of characters, with personal questlines and multiple endings for each one. A beautiful but shattered ancient world, where you can explore breathtaking environments filled with hidden details. You can also customise your character with a vast array of equipment and collect armour sets that confer powerful bonuses, while upgrading and modifying the loot you find. Besides that you’ll ablso unlock new abilities to personalise your playstyle.</p>

<p>It definitely looks fantastic, and we can’t wait to show you more. Empyreal will release on 8 May for PC via Steam, PlayStation®5, and Xbox Series X|S. Empyreal is priced at £24.99/$29.99/€29.99, with a 10% launch discount on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/assassins-creed-shadows-how-to-refill-scouts/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features some brand new gameplay mechanics that set it apart from past entries in the series. After accepting the vast majority of main and side quests, the game won't tell you outright where to go and will only provide some general hints regarding where you have to go, leaving you on your own to search for your next quest objective. If you want to speed up this process, you will have to use <strong>scouts</strong>, but every season, you will only be able to use them for a limited number of times, and you will have to wait for the season to change if you want to use them again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321131024_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully,<strong> you are not forced to wait for a season to change if you want to use scouts again</strong> after depleting their use and if you are willing to spend some resources. Besides forcing a partial season change via the main menu when the compass in the top right of the map hits south, which still requires time to pass, in any <strong>Kakuraga safehouse</strong> that you have unlocked, you can <strong>refill scouts</strong>&nbsp;by interacting with the sacks hanging on one of the walls and paying 200 mon. Constantly refilling scouts can be a costly endeavor, so you should still avoid abusing the system, but in case of emergency, this option is extremely handy to have, especially if you prefer to use scouts to salvage Stockpiles from enemy strongholds or use them to clear the Wanted status instead of using them to find quest objectives faster. To expand and improve the capabilities of scouts, you will need to upgrade the Kakurega in your Hideout to level 2 and the Stables.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250321132000_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you like using the scout system in Assassin's Creed Shadows a lot, you will also want to recruit as many scouts as possible. To do so, you will need to upgrade your <strong>Study</strong> in the Hideout, as each upgrade will increase the number of available scouts up to 9. You will need a lot of resources to do so, and the best way to gather enough of them relatively quickly is to complete the seasonal contracts available for each region, besides clearing enemy camps and strongholds. Much like refilling scouts, seasonal contracts can be accepted in any Kakurega.</p>

<p>The dust has finally started to settle on Monster Hunter Wilds’ incredible launch. But if you thought Capcom would leave it there, you’re deadly wrong. We’re just getting started, and the newly announced Monster Hunter Wilds First Title Showcase coming in April is the next phase.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-united-states-so-far/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> in 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds is also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-become-the-fastest-selling-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling game in Capcom’s long and illustrious history</a>. They’re some impressive accolades to shout from the mountains. Although I wouldn’t recommend it as you’re likely to disturb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/creature-coin-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ancient Wyverns</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-catch-whoppers-in-monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whoppers</a>, and other other-worldly creatures.</p>



<p>The first major content injection is on the way courtesy of the Monster Hunter Wilds First Title update. A Showcase has been set in stone which will unveil new footage and features.</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a Showcase for the first Free Title Update in Monster Hunter Wilds. The presentation is set for <strong>March 25</strong>, with the update launching in “<strong>Early April</strong>.”</p>



<p>The developer has also declared the Showcase is being presented by producer Ryozo Tsujimoto. You can watch the show on the <a href="http://twitch.tv/monsterhunter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds Twitch channel</a>, and it will show “Mizutsune and a host of other new additions.”</p>



<p>We reported a while back that Mizutsune was part of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-roadmap-mizutsune-dlc-update-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap</a>. This will be our first real look at the creature, how it fights, and how you can prepare yourself for the titanic battle.</p>



<p>Capcom is making sure fans are eating good. If this announcement isn’t a testament to that, you only need to look at the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-promotion-is-rewarding-players-with-lots-of-free-goodies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds promotion offering free goodies and bonuses</a>.</p>

The first of these, <em>FEAR</em>, is now in.</p><p>Meanwhile, 2004's <em>Silent Hill 4</em> has joined the program with the addition of “restored scenes that were never available on PC before,” according to a press release from GOG. This includes missing “hauntings,” the strange events that occur, which GOG found were in the PC code but never included—their engineers have dug them out and got them working.</p><p>Alongside those two headliners are some other classic games that could easily merit the same moniker. Stone-cold classics like <em>Deus Ex</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout 2</em>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption</em>, <em>Alone In The Dark 1</em> to <em>3</em>, and all eight original <em>Ultima </em>games are also now included, meaning they will be constantly maintained to work on modern PCs for as long as GOG exists (and, the company told me, it has plans in place to ensure preservation can continue if it was to go away). Oh, and Crystal Dynamic’s first three&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raiders</em>.</p><p>Here’s the full list of new additions.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visions-of-mana-director-leaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> can release as many remakes and new mainline FF entries as it wants. However, none of them are likely to have as great an impact as Final Fantasy 14 Online continues to have. With tens of millions of subscribers coming back each month, FF14 Online is where it’s at—and new DLC expansions help.</p>



<p>Every so often a giant update comes along with a content pile so big it makes the content of Santa’s sleigh seem minimal. The Seekers of Eternity 7.2 update is the latest and great patch for Final Fantasy 14, so let’s check it out.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14-update-7-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 14 Update 7.2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>March 25 is when the Seekers of Eternity update goes live in Final Fantasy 14.</strong></p>



<p>There’s also a cinematic trailer to get you ready for the incoming content and patch notes. You can check it out here.</p>

<h3 id="h-new-quest-to-complete">New Quest to Complete</h3>

<h3 id="h-battle-system-bolstered">Battle System Bolstered</h3>



<p>We know there’s a new dungeon to explore called the Underkeep. Plus, Season 8 of Final Fantasy 14’s PvP is set to get underway, and many other changes and tweaks have been made to combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-greater-graphics">Greater Graphics</h3>



<p>Square Enix has made a serious graphical improvement to lots of the game’s weapons and accessories, improved the resolution for vegetation and environmental objects, and adjusted lighting and shadows to appear more realistically.</p>

Here, you can see every single change, which piece of DLC you need to benefit properly, and what to expect overall.</p>



<p>This should keep Final Fantasy 14 fans ticking over until the 7.3 update and the eventual successor to Dawntrail.</p>

		<p>It’s a great time to be a driving game fan, with 2025 already hotting up with the arrival of games like Wreckfest 2 and Assetto Corsa Evo. Firmly on our upcoming radar is JDM: Japanese Drift Master, which might boast a Ronseal-styled name, but which is looking absolutely incredible, especially if you have any interest in the Japanese drift scene (watching Fast &amp; The Furious: Tokyo Drift doesn’t count, Initial D does).</p>
<p><iframe title="JDM: Japanese Drift Master | Eurobeat Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VFOkWEiIhIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer shows off more of the drifting action as racers slide their way through neon-infused Japanese cities and towns through to the beautiful, traditional countryside. The team have used their own photos, as well as images lifted from Google Earth to truly capture the look and feel of the country, something that it looks as though they’ve absolutely done.</p>
<p>This new trailer features an exclusive Eurobeat song that’s been written for JDM: Japanese Drift Master. Called LIFESHIFTFIRE!, it’s an electrifying Eurobeat track composed by Kamil Hasselhoff, Naski, and Marga, and it made its international debut during the Future Games Show. Music looks to play an integral part in the game, and in keeping with the drift scene, it’ll bounce between Eurobeat, Dance and Nu-Metal while you’re trying to achieve drift supremacy.</p>


<p>There’s a fully featured story mode here, and you’ll play Polish driver Touma, a new entrant on the scene. It’s up to you to take him from a nobody to the drift master, and there’s a great bunch of licensed cars from manufacturers like Nissan and Mazda in which to do it. JDM looks like it should be fairly welcoming too, with a Simcade driving setup that will give you heaps of control, without being too exacting.</p>
<p>JDM: Japanese Drift Master is due to arrive on the 21st of May, and will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48?__cf_chl_tk=b5um8CjyirgFe0bmT1hc5EMp5tCkEheD_xZPmT01ybw-1742556033-1.0.1.1-H9l41dC590rpjYP0w1iB5coAWf3qRK_AtPiNvYL45T4">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master">GOG</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-one-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows reached an important player number milestone on its first day of availability, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>A few hours after the latest entry in their series launched on PC and consoles, the publisher confirmed the game had passed 1 million players. While it's not clear how many have accessed the game via a Ubisoft + subscription, this is definitely an excellent result which bodes well for the upcoming weekend, when the number will likely get higher.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It's not even 4PM here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!</p>
<p>Thank YOU from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you! 💝 <a href="https://t.co/1cqwABrQfN">pic.twitter.com/1cqwABrQfN</a></p>
<p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While not exactly attempting to push the boundaries of the open-world RPG formula established by Origins, Assassin's Creed Shadows is a more than worthy new entry in the series. Despite its often inaccurate recreation of Feudal Japan, it attempts to bring back stealth gameplay into the spotlight while not doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, making for a surprisingly varied experience. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

		<p>It’s the time of the week where we’re starting to hit cruise control, readying ourselves for two days of chilling out, time with family, and hopefully, one or two video games. But first we have to tell you what we’ve been playing <em>this</em> week, and I have to say I’m feeling a renewed love for gaming at the start of 2025. Monster Hunter Wilds has probably helped with that, though friends and family alike already feel that they’ve squeezed nearly everything out of the launch build, and are now impatiently waiting for more.</p>
<p>I’ve played a bunch of my Dreamcast favourites on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/retroid-pocket-5-review-one-of-the-best-gaming-handhelds-you-can-buy/">Retroid Pocket 5</a>, as well as continuing with my run through Yakuza: Like a Dragon which I’m really enjoying. Other than that, I’ve been playing Wanderstop for review, and I loved returning to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> in its Definitive Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2, Helldivers 2, and “Generically Dull RPG With Too Much Talking #23787, aka Dragon Age: Veilguard”. Also Split Fiction which he says, “Is just fab.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile <strong>Gamoc</strong> has spent the week playing Atomfall for review, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">AC Shadows for some guide work</a>, plus some Phasmophobia and Earth Defence Force 5 with his sister.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played a bit more Witcher 3, starting the Hearts of Stone DLC. He’s also played Football Manager 24, telling us, “I gave up the FC Brea save as that was too impossible. Now I’m at SC Bastia and overachieving with them. Expected mid-table but currently flying in the promotion places.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still working his way through Mafia III, though he thinks he’s on the home stretch now. He said, “I’ve had a good time with it but it definitely suffers from that open world bloat that’s become prevalent in a lot of games. Story missions are gated behind open-world activities to the point where – 25 hours in – I’m eager to wrap things up and move onto my next game.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> was on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">Assassin’s Creed: Shadows review</a>, which he thoroughly enjoyed! Also, Split Fiction, “it’s fantastic!” and watching his partner play Two Point Museum, which “looks loads of fun!”</p>
<p>Joining us from the States, <strong>Miguel</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/">Atelier Yumia</a>, Zenless Zone Zero, Girls Frontline 2 EXILIUM, and the Demon Tides demo!</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> is thankfully on the mend, and he’s been able to get some gaming time in along the way. He told us, “My recovery has not been accompanied by Nintendo titles as I had thought it would, with Avowed instead providing a surprisingly chilled out RPG experience. Combat is a little dull but the world is cool to explore. I’ve also spent some family time playing through Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga which is more bloated and unnecessarily expanded than my gallbladder was when I went to A&amp;E… but a lot more fun than that experience.” Glowing praise indeed!</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has also dipped a toe in with Atomfall’s opening hours and is looking forward to more, but the game that’s really starting to gets its hooks into him is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a> with its large scale action-RPG raid battle vibes. He’s even roping me in to start playing it with him.</p>
<p><em>But enough about us, what about you? What have you played?</em></p>

<p>After a hugely successful release, it seems several studios are already set to battle it out to claim the rights to a full-length Split Fiction movie—bringing the dramatic journey of Mio and Zoe to life.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-trophy-and-achievement-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> had the tough job of following up <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-like-it-takes-two-split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>—2021’s Game of the Year. I’d argue that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-reaches-major-sales-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">milestone of two million copies sold in just one week</a> has put this doubt to rest. Josef Fares and his team have done it again, and it looks like another triumphant statement that cooperative multiplayer sells.</p>



<p>Now, it’s time to see if the medium is as effective on the big screen. A Split Fiction movie is heavily rumored—barely two weeks removed from its debut—and it looks promising.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-movie-could-make-a-great-co-op-caper">Split Fiction Movie Could Make A Great Co-op Caper</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Imagine what the power of modern cinema could do. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the 2025 Game Developers Conference has birthed Split Fiction movie talk. Story Kitchen is the company potentially “<strong>Putting together the film’s cast, writers and director into a package as offers for the rights keep coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios.</strong>“</p>



<p>Again, the rumor and chatter come directly from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gdc-awards-balatro-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDC 2025</a>, so it remains to be seen if the talk will continue once the event has concluded. Hopefully, a Split Fiction movie has better luck than the It Takes Two one. A movie for the previous co-op title was given the go-ahead, but it apparently remains on hold for now.</p>



<p>If we do get a Split Fiction movie, will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-split-fiction-voice-actors-revealed-who-voices-zoe-mio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoe and Mio’s voice actors</a> get to reprise their roles? Only time will tell. For now, we’ll continue to lap up every second of Split Fiction. After all, new secrets keep being discovered such as the now-infamous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-split-fiction-laser-hell-secret-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laser Hell Secret Hell</a> featuring a guest appearance from director Josef Fares himself!</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Netmarble Neo announced that the action/adventure RPG Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will debut on Steam Early Access in just a few days, on Wednesday, March 26. This follows the demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-pc-demo-out-now-on-steam-full-release-in-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went live last month</a> as part of Steam Next Fest. Clearly, the developers received positive feedback and are ready to move on with the next step.</p>
<p>The game is planned to be in early access for at least four weeks, which would be an unusually brief timeframe. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store page</a> provides several details on how the early access version will differ from the full release:</p>
<p><em>Much of Westeros will be available to explore during the Early Access phase. Players will be able to visit the major cities such as Winterfell, King's Landing and Highgarden and visit the surrounding areas. The Early Access version contains 50 chapters of the main storyline, hundreds of side missions and open world encounters, multiple co-op dungeons, and endgame PVE challenges. During Early Access, players will begin their journey in the northern regions of Westeros, exploring iconic locations such as Castle Black, Winterfell, and areas beyond The Wall, eventually making it to The Reach.</em></p>
<p>Following the early access phase, Netmarble will expand into the Stormlands region to introduce additional areas for Game of Thrones: Kingsroad players to explore. These new areas, such as Storm's End and Felwood, will feature new open-world content, new quests, and co-op dungeons. During early access, the developers will gather feedback to further refine elements such as game balance, graphics, UX/UI, and more.</p>

<p>While the full game will be free to play, to play Game of Thrones: Kingsroad during the early access phase, players will have to purchase one of the Founder's Packs. The Standard Pack is priced at $24.99 and includes a Northern Outfit, the Emoji Pack - Jon Snow, and 350 Iron Bank Marks of currency. The Deluxe Pack is priced at $49.99 and includes the aforementioned in-game items plus the Battle Pass Premium, Wandering Crow Outfit, Darkcloud Mount, Nameplate Background: Ghost, Nameplate Frame: Harbinger, 750 Iron Bank Marks, and 50K Copper.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Pack is the most expensive at $89.99, adding access to the Battle Pass Premium+, White Fang Mount, Brotherhood Without Banners Reins and Saddle (Horse) and Brotherhood Without Banners Saddle (Direwolf), Nameplate Background: Iron Throne, Nameplate Frame: Conqueror, 2K Iron Bank Marks and 200K Copper.</p>

            <p>Six years ago Nightdive Studios announced they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/20-years-after-release-system-shock-2-is-finally-getting-an-enhanced-edition">doing a remaster</a> of sci-fi sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a>, which they were calling System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition. But back then they were also busy working on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-remake">full-blown remake</a> of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock">System Shock</a>. Turns out that first outing to Citadel Station took priority. But now that they're done with that, the studio has finally revealed a release date for the sequel's remaster, which they've sneakily renamed System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster. </p>

<p>It's coming out June 25th this year, as revealed by Nightdive in the above trailer shown during the Future Games Show's spring showcase. As you can see this is definitely "remaster" territory as opposed to a full remake. Resuited, but not rebooted. Watch as an HD-ifying line sweeps over the screen to show before and after shots of Citadel Station and its hostile inhabitants. The changes seem fairly light-handed, too.</p>
<p>There's widescreen support, remodelled enemies, "enhanced" reload animations, and "optimized controller support" among other small improvements, we're told. Some similar improvements can already be achieved for free thanks to the game's long-standing mod scene, which lessens the impact of these tweaks a little for anyone who has already done that. The remastering studio were "paying particular attention to the co-op multiplayer" wrote news poster Craig back in 2019, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-one-knows-who-is-patching-system-shock-2">talking to Nightdive director Stephen Kick</a>. There doesn't appear to be any mention of co-op in the Steam blurb but the studio has previously confirmed it's still intended to appear.</p>
<p>"Multiplayer and co-op is currently in development," said the studio <a href="https://x.com/NightdiveStudio/status/1894841847350206848">in a tweet</a> last year. "We will share more info on these and other features as we get closer to launch day."</p>
<p>System Shock 2, while beloved by many, can be quite clunky to play from a modern perspective. It'll be interesting to see whether the changes make one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">the best RPGs on PC</a> more approachable. Nightdive have earned a lot of trust with the series - Jeremy expressed much love in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/system-shock-review">review of the System Shock remake</a>, calling it "a breathtakingly beautiful and astonishingly faithful remake." And this upcoming remaster will be free to anyone who pre-ordered that first remake, say Nightdive. So that's nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has announced its next batch of SNES games headed to the Switch Online catalogue - and there's a pretty obvious nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the list.
</p>
<p>
Four strategy games from Koei all arrive for Switch Online next Friday, 28th March, including two Nobunaga's Ambition titles. 
</p>
<p>
Nobunaga's Ambition lets you compete for control of Japan either as the infamous Oda Nobunaga or his rivals as they attempt to unify the country. This is the same conflict that plays out over the course of Ubisoft's new Feudal Japan-set Assassin's Creed, in which Oda Nobunaga is also a key figure.
</p>
<p>
Coming to Nintendo Switch Online next week are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition</li>
<li>Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness</li>
<li>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 4: Wall of Fire </li>
<li>Uncharted Water: New Horizons</li>
</ul>
<p>
And you can watch footage of all four games in the video below:
</p>
<p>
28th March is also when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-removing-game-from-switch-online-catalogue-in-japan">SNES game Super Soccer will be delisted from Nintendo's Switch Online catalogue</a>, at least in Japan - the first game to disappear from the subscription service.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer previously contacted Nintendo for more information on why the game will be removed, and whether this removal will also take place elsewhere in the world. We're yet to receive any more information there.

		<p>Still riding the highs of the success of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team has released a new dev diary to reveal more about their upcoming original horror game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive Into The World - Bloober Team Dev Diaries" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuSJpd2c7UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>Co-directors Jacek Zieba and Wojciech Piejko gave us a tour of this setting. Amongst the inspirations are games like Dead Space and the challenge of Dark Souls, while movies such as Twelve Monkeys also provide some similar tones. The unusual looking suit for the Traveller is intended to look a bit like a deep sea diver, the heavy plates and the large dome-like helmet in particular. You’ll need that armour to survive encounters with the Orphans, the twisted human forms of what is left of humanity from this time, delving into a bit of body horror.</p>
<p>There’s some small snippets of gameplay within the dev diary, but Bloober say that a broader gameplay reveal will likely be coming soon.</p>

<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this year.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has announced its first sales milestone for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which launched yesterday and had notched up more than a million players by the afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
It's our first indication of how well the game is performing, as a pivotal title not just for the Assassin's Creed series, but Ubisoft in general - though it is still very early.
</p>
<p>
"It's not even 4pm here in Canada and Assassin's Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players," stated a message posted to the official <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067">Assassin's Creed social media account</a>. "Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for joining this adventure in Feudal Japan. We are beyond excited to start this journey with you!"

<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows faces some tough comparisons - the series' last large launch Valhalla arrived in late 2020, when many of us were at home - and arrives at a time when Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game was also repeatedly delayed for further polish, following last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> - another key title for Ubisoft, but one <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">which significantly underperformed</a>.
</p>
<p>
How well does Assassin's Creed Shadows have to do for Ubisoft to consider it a success? The publisher has not said. But it's worth considering the scope and scale of the game, the number of Ubisoft studios working on it, and the impact of those delays. 
</p>
<p>
For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction notched up 1m sales in just 48 hours last week</a>, but will have cost far less to make and market.
</p>
<p>
An early look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/#1w">Steam figures</a> - as the only major platform to share player numbers publicly - shows a peak of 41,412 players overnight. But again, comparisons are difficult - the game is also available on PC via Ubisoft Connect, so this does not paint a full picture. 
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's likely we'll have to wait until after the game's first weekend - and likely more word from Ubisoft itself - before Shadows' early fortunes become clear.
</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Remedy Entertainment has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> will launch this summer for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, shared a healthy dose of gameplay and revealed one of the big supernatural dangers you’ll face in the game: Sticky Notes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Jobs and Gameplay – FBC: Firebreak (Community First Look)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Oh sure, yellow sticky notes seem innocuous enough to you and me, their small size (often cut into cute shapes these days) and weak glue making them mildly useful, but in The Oldest House and with the Hiss still running rampant? Well, haunted sticky notes are a real problem. The gameplay reveal for FBC: Firebreak focuses on this Job, a crisis-filled mission that will take you to the Executive Sector of the Federal Bureau of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>. This mission, titled Paper Chase, is just one of many to take on in the game, with the sole objective to destroy as many sticky notes as possible. Other missions might have you try to find mannequin ski instructors and load them onto a paranatural ski lift…</p>
<p>With three-player PvE co-op at its heart, you’ll have three saved loadouts to choose from, Crisis Kits, which are themed around a particular tool and playstyle. You’ll then pick the Threat Level and Clearance Level of a Job, determining the difficulty of enemies and then the complexity and length of the mission.</p>
<p>The trailer and dev diary both show plenty of what you’ll expect to face. There’s regular Hiss zombie-type enemies, bomb squad Hiss with much heavier armour, and then humanoid forms constructed entirely of sticky notes. There’s even a giant Sandman-like boss to battle. One thing you’ll have to be wary of is getting covered with sticky notes yourself, with allies able to wash you down or showers dotted around the world to do the same – albeit at the cost of slowing you down for a bit from the cold water, unless you fix the heaters for the showers.</p>

<p>In addition to standard weapons like shotguns, there’s also a crank-fired fluid projector, an electric charge impactor, and the big wrench which can have a squeaky toy pig attached to it.&nbsp;There’s plenty of Left 4 Dead vibes to the action here, with safe rooms helping to provide some structure to the levels, and the need to defend from alerted enemies.</p>
<p>Remedy has already confirmed that FBC: Firebreak will be available day one on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, PC Game Pass, PlayStation Plus Extra and PlayStation Plus Premium. In addition to this, they’ve now confirmed that all playable content will be available to all players for free, meaning any new levels will be playable for all. There’s no word on monetisation outside of that, but Remedy will share those details another time.</p>

			<p>Bloober Team <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuSJpd2c7UY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aired</a> the first episode of the Cronos: The New Dawn developer diary series during the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025. This episode saw the game's two directors revealing a few details, such as the inspiration, which came from Carpenter's The Thing but also Netflix's TV series Dark, as well as Dead Space, movies like 12 Monkeys, and surprisingly even the Dark Souls series of games was cited as Bloober reportedly seeks to push this game into a slightly more challenging direction.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-bloober-teams-next-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, you play as one of the Travelers. They are being sent to the ruins of human civilization to search for the time rifts and jump back in time to extract people who didn't survive the apocalypse. Travelers are the only ones who can travel to the past and survive the inevitable encounters with monsters. The suit's design looks like a diver because Travelers are not typical soldiers, but more like divers in time.</p>
<p>The setting is an alternative history when the world ends in the 1980s with an apocalyptic event that the team called The Change. Interestingly, the monsters are called the Orphans because they are what was left by humanity. They can take different forms, so players will face different enemies with different abilities. The important ingredient, Bloober Team said, is body horror, perhaps a little bit as an homage to The Thing. So, they are only created from human flesh.</p>
<p>At the end of the deep dive, the directors also replied to a few rapid-fire community questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>There will be ladders</li>
<li>There will be locations with huge walls of flash</li>
<li>There may be aliens</li>
<li>Yes, you can punch monsters in the face (if they have a face)</li>
<li>Fire is important in the game</li>
<li>Dismemberment is featured in Cronos: The New Dawn, but it doesn't work like in Dead Space, as the team implemented their own take on combat</li>
</ul>

<p>Following the highly acclaimed launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team's next project is undoubtedly much anticipated among horror fans. The game is scheduled to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> may have only been released a couple of weeks ago, but there is already a bidding war for the rights to a reported film adaptation.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">Variety</a>, which revealed a film adaptation of Hazelight's latest co-op caper is now in the pipeline. Sources told the publication that media company Story Kitchen - a name you may recognise from our coverage of other video game to screen projects, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toejam-and-earl-film-in-the-works-at-amazon">ToeJam and Earl</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-animated-tv-series-in-the-works">Vampire Survivors</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">Slime Rancher</a> - is in the process of assembling the film's cast, writers and director.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Variety stated offers for rights to the Split Fiction film are "coming in from multiple top Hollywood studios", although no names were mentioned in today's report.</p>

<p>This is not the first Hazelight game reportedly getting a film adaptation. In 2022, marital platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hazelight-studios-acclaimed-it-takes-two-being-adapted-for-film-and-television">It Takes Two was also said to be making its way to both the big and small screen</a>.</p>
<p>It was later suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-movie-enters-development-at-amazon-studios-dwayne-johnson-may-star">Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson was attached to the film project</a>, while Pat Casey and Josh Miller - the writing duo behind dj2's live-action Sonic the Hedgehog movies - were working on the big screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Little has been heard of the project since, and earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-josef-fares-doesnt-know-whats-happening-with-the-it-takes-two-film-adaptation">Hazelight founder Josef Fares told Eurogamer even he didn't know what was happening with the It Takes Two film</a>.</p>

<p>As for Split Fiction, well, it has certainly done well for itself. Along with glowing reviews across the board, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">the game sold 2m copies in the first week of release</a>.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's five star Split Fiction review</a>.</p>
<p>Also in Split Fiction news, earlier this week two players were invited to Sweden to see Hazelight's next game after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-players-invited-to-see-studios-next-game-after-beating-rock-hard-secret-level">they completed a secret level so challenging that "barely" any members of the studio's own team have managed to complete it</a>. "This is a crazy, crazy achievement," Fares told the skilled duo via a pre-recorded message found at the end of the level.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft seemingly has an update in mind for the Xbox App which will show every game users have installed on their PC. That includes titles on both Steam and Epic Games.</p>
<p>Microsoft inadvertently included a mockup of this  user interface as part of an official blog post titled <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox</a>. It subsequently removed the image after enquiries were made, but not before eagle-eyed viewers took a copy.</p>
<p>The image itself, which you can see in the header above, showed an Xbox UI displayed on a TV screen, which at cursory glance may seem unextraordinary, however on closer inspection you can see the UI has a clear Steam tab listed along with the likes of Game Pass, Recently Added and Owned. Elsewhere in the image, the same UI with that telling Steam tab label is displayed on tablets and handheld devices.</p>

<p>While only a Steam label is visible on Xbox's mockup, sources tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">The Verge</a> Microsoft is working on an Xbox app update that will show <em>every</em> game users have installed on their PCs, so that includes the Epic Games Store even though it is missing from the image.</p>
<p>"I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly," The Verge's Tom Warren writes, adding this update is still "in the early stages" of development. It may not even ship at all, Warren suggests.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for further comment on the leaked UI images.</p>

			<p>During the Future Games Show: Spring Showcase 2025, TaleWorlds Entertainment announced that a new nautical expansion will launch this June for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927200/Mount__Blade_II_Bannerlord__War_Sails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">War Sails</a>, it will introduce naval warfare for the first time, as well as a Viking-inspired faction and new explorable coastal regions. Players will be able to command fleets, engage in naval battles, board enemy ships, and enforce blockades, reshaping warfare on land and sea. According to TaleWorlds, the ability to explore by sea, conduct naval blockades, and engage in ship-based combat will influence battle strategies throughout Calradia, not just in the new territories. Beware, though: storms and attrition can undo even the best-laid plans.</p>
<p>Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord Players will have to master wind and water physics, board or ram ships, and cripple enemies by smashing oars, sinking hulls, or tearing sails. There are 18 ships available, each with unique handling characteristics shaped by wind and waves. They can be upgraded with siege engines, sails, and rams. Throughout the gameplay, players will get to acquire new ships, upgrade ports or win ships and figureheads.</p>
<p>The Nords call the new Northern Kingdom home. In true Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord style, players will be able to trade, recruit, or fight in this land of craggy peaks and icy fjords. The War Sails expansion also adds a northern sea, islands, rivers and open waters. Of course, players will also find new companions, Norse banners, hairstyles, tattoos, armor, unique weapons, new spears, swords, and axes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IA0YoFBX60M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release of the War Sails expansion, scheduled for June 17, will also be accompanied by the release of the free patch v1.3. The developers are also planning further updates to introduce new gameplay mechanics, including stealth and disguise systems for dungeons and hideouts, random events that will tie into the character trait system, a Parley feature, numerous combat improvements, new weapon types, and additional exciting improvements for players and modders alike.</p>
<p>In closing, TaleWorlds announced that Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord has sold over five million units across all platforms since<a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-confirmed-to-launch-on-october-25th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its launch</a> a few years back.</p>

Following a band of lone-wolf vampire hunters who unite to fight for the fate of their world, this marks the second console game from the company. This title will be the first released under new brand AmuLit, formed in September 2024, and has already attracted tons of attention from fans around the world.</p><p>More than just another love story—something Voltage Inc. is renowned for—this title offers a dramatic, thought-provoking narrative, breathtaking visuals, and compelling performances, all brought to you by the talented writers, artists, and cast.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The Redbell Tree scrapes the sky, standing proudly in the heart of Hemeria, a land of sunlight. In a land ruled by a monarchy for generations, humans lived in peace and tranquility. That is, until the dawn of the day the world was dyed red.</p><p>On that day, vampires laid waste to Hemeria. They preyed on, devoured, and devastated its inhabitants. A great many people would go on to mourn their loved ones, their families and friends, for the rest of their lives. One particular town of Hemeria bore such a tragedy. A single girl was left alone in despair and disgrace. She vowed revenge, and grew into one of Hemeria’s finest vampire hunters.</p><p>And one day, she became a member of the Elpis 7; those who inspired a light of hope in its people.</p><p>One day, she receives a letter from an unknown sender. Upon her arrival to the mansion indicated inside, she finds vampire hunters and a royal knight awaiting her. The hunters assembled receive an order from the monarch.</p><p>They are to form a squad and invade Nyx, the world of vampires. A shiver of anticipation crackles through her at the opportunity she’s been waiting for her whole life. However, this is but the beginning of a game wherein the fate of her world is at stake. Pawns are sent forth, discarded, hidden out of sight…</p><p>And just how many will remain when this all comes to an end?</p><p><strong>■ Main Characters</strong></p><p><strong>Juliet Rose</strong> (name customizable)</p><p>She who hunts for Revenge.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_001.png"></a></figure><p>An elite vampire hunter and member of the Elpis 7. After her brother, her only living relative, was killed by a vampire, she swore revenge and devoted her life to that of a vampire hunter. Rather than let her hatred consume her, she fights with beauty and strength, which has led to her popularity as a savior of the people.</p><p>She is just as formidable off of the battlefield, and when challenged to games by the residents of Hemeria, she isn’t above cheating to get her way.</p><p>The news of the discovery of an entrance to Nyx, the world of the vampires, stokes a flame within her, and she dives head first into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seek revenge.</p><p><strong>Ciaran Lowell</strong> (voiced by Takuya Eguchi)</p><p>He who hunts for Power.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Red-Bells-Lament_03-20-25_Characters_002.png"></a></figure><p>Even among the elite vampire hunters that make up the Elpis 7, he is lauded as the strongest.

However, he thinks favorably of those in pursuit of strength, and will at times cooperate with the heroine. He takes pride in his own strength, honed by his daily training, but he is pragmatic and will not engage in reckless battle.</p><p>When summoned by the kingdom to join the invasion of Nyx, he is the one whose intentions most closely mirror the heroine’s.

Another week is upon us - and that means more Epic Games Store freebies, with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-world-evolution-2">Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> currently available for nowt. But things are a little bit different this time around; starting today, Epic is introducing weekly free games to its mobile store - available worldwide on Android devices and on iOS in the EU.
</p>
<p>
As usual, Epic's latest free games are available for seven days - starting today, 20th March, and running through to next Thursday, 27th March. During that time, you can grab the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jurassic World Evolution 2 (PC)</li>
<li>Super Meat Boy Forever (iOS/Android)</li>
<li>Eastern Exorcist (iOS/Android)</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
It's a decent line-up then, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/jurassic-world-evolution-2">starting with Jurassic World Evolution 2</a> - Frontier Developments' dinosaur-themed park management sequel, in which players attempt to create a thriving dino attraction that, all being well, won't attempt to eat the guests.
</p>
<p>
As for this week's mobile offerings, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-meat-boy-forever">Super Meat Boy Forever</a> is a good 'un, taking the twitchy platforming of developer Team Meat's 2010 classic and turning it into an endless runner. "Super Meat Boy Forever does more with two buttons than most do with 14", we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-meat-boy-forever-does-more-with-two-buttons-than-most-do-with-14">wrote back in 2017</a>. And finally, there's Eastern Exorcist - a side-scrolling action RPG set in a fantasy world of spirits and monsters. Epic notes this one's only available in certain regions, but doesn't say which.
</p>
<p>
And if you're wondering what's coming next, you might have to wait a bit. Epic's breaking from tradition this week, and hasn't revealed what'll be replacing its current bunch of free games. Instead, its next two PC freebies are simply listed as "mystery game" over on its store. 
</p>
<p>
Epic, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">launched its mobile store last August</a>, following ceaseless legal activity and new EU regulations requiring major companies such as Apple to allow sideloading and alternate marketplaces on their devices. Not long after, Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-bringing-free-games-to-its-mobile-store-in-a-bid-to-entice-new-users">confirmed its free weekly games programme would be coming to mobile</a>, and here we are now.

            <title><![CDATA[MLB The Show 25 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mlb-the-show-25-review.1140879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t envy the work it takes to keep an annual series like MLB The Show going. There’s so much to do and perilously little time to do it in, whether that’s adding new features, fixing the things people didn’t like, or writing and producing an entire new season of The Negro Leagues. It’s especially hard when all that time and effort often gets distilled down to a single question: is it worth upgrading from last year? Thanks in large part to fundamental changes to the way the Road To The Show and Diamond Dynasty modes work, MLB The Show 25 answers that question with a resounding yes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual Baseball hasn’t changed a lot this year, which I don’t mind, but there are some nice tweaks throughout. For starters, recent changes like two-way players, adjustments to shift rules, and the pitch clock are all fully incorporated at this point. There are some new quick time events that can happen when you are locked into controlling a single player, rather than the whole team, the most notable of which is the new swim move to avoid tags. I was a little nervous that it would make stealing bases too easy, but the prompt only seems to come up occasionally, and is rare enough to feel more like a treat than a clutch. Infielders now have a few different initial reactions that can have a big impact on how quickly they get to a ball, too. This mostly means that poor defenders play more like it now, so the net effect is worse defense, but I think it’s a worthwhile tradeoff that makes great defenders more valuable, particularly in Franchise mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a new ambush hitting feature where you can “cheat” towards inside or outside pitches, making it easier to hit on the side you choose and harder on the side you don’t. I like it in theory, though I’ve ultimately had more success staying neutral, and so I only rarely use it. Hitting overall still feels great, though something seems off about perfect contact. You still get the same satisfying crack of the bat, but it feels like the vast, vast majority of the time it results in a hard hit out or just a single, which is way too little payoff for what should be the best possible hits. Hopefully that gets adjusted over time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Franchise, where you get to take control of your favorite team and right the wrongs of ownership (like adding a badly needed impact bat to my beloved Mariners), is pretty similar to last year. The custom game entry, which lets you auto-simulate games until high-leverage situations come up and you opt into taking control, remains one of my favorite features. The way you offer free agent contracts has been overhauled this year: You now prioritize a small selection of targets, and you accumulate interest from them as days pass. It does a great job simplifying the free agent process, and I like the strategy around deciding between joining the pursuit of marquee free agents vs rounding out my roster. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The core of The Show 25 remains as solid as ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All that is to say the core of The Show 25 remains as solid as ever, focusing on some small but appreciated updates over sweeping overhauls. And while they may not have fundamentally changed, Franchise and March to October both take advantage of new production elements, like player vs player comparisons. The new G.O.A.T. difficulty is as hard as it sounds, too, with fast pitches, aggressive breaks on balls, and a very small Plate Coverage Indicator. I will freely admit it’s much too hard for me, though I expect people who crave punishing challenges will enjoy this one. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Road to the Show</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Road To The Show, where you take control of your own custom ballplayer as they lead up to and then eventually enter the Major League, is where you’ll find some of the larger changes year-over-year – and they do a fantastic job of reinvigorating the mode. Unlike previous years, where you participate in the combine before being drafted into the league, now you begin as an amateur all the way back in high school. It’s brief, but playing out the end of senior year and trying to impress scouts and recruiters while you chase a championship is a fun twist. Pinky Rogers, my two-way pitcher and first baseman, dominated the competition and found himself firmly in the crosshairs of two dozen big league clubs and, in another new addition to The Show, college scouts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This led to a legitimately interesting choice: do I jump straight into pro ball and start working my way up, or do I go to college, time-skip to the end of senior year, and try to become a highly polished, highly drafted blue chip prospect? I opted for the student-athlete route, and accepted the offer to play for TCU, one of the eight real college teams to choose from. The authenticity was impressive, from recreations of each team's home and away jerseys as I played through the college baseball playoffs to the distinct TINK as metal bats made contact with the ball. Choosing that route meant I arrived at the Minor Leagues with higher stats and could make the jump from AA to AAA much, much faster than in previous years, which is a big improvement from what has historically been a bit of a slog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big change is to how players are upgraded. Previous iterations of The Show had a “use it to improve it” model, sort of like in an Elder Scrolls RPG,  where success with specific actions, like hitting against left handed pitchers or throwing strikes with specific pitches, slowly raised those particular attributes. That’s now replaced by a token system, where you get points to allocate. It might sound like a subtle difference, but it massively changes how you develop as a player. Every good at bat, pitch, play in the field, or training session accumulates progress, which makes the pull of playing “just one more game” very difficult to resist. It’s a little tough to justify doing some of the longer or tougher training minigames, like the Inter-Squad game, when you can just as easily make progress doing simple ladder drills, but it’s a worthwhile tradeoff that has made Road To The Show hard for me to put down. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Storyline</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the marquee features of The Show is the Negro League storyline, which returns for its third season. It remains one of the most impressive modes in any sports game, combining a mini documentary featurette about Negro League stars like “Cool Papa” Bell or Caleb “Turkey” Stearns with playable moments from their careers. It’s once again anchored with stories from Bob Kendrick, the magnetic president of the Negro League museum, and continues to stand out as an excellent overlap of history and gameplay.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, new stories aside, this mode is functionality identical to the previous two iterations, which puts it in a bit of an odd place. I praised the debut of the Negro League in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mlb-the-show-23-review"><u>MLB The Show 23 review</u></a>, but the lack of advancement over the last few years is disappointing. It’s still a mix of excellent vignettes and basic gameplay challenges (separated by long loading times), but the challenges themselves are often just to get some hits or strike a few people out, which is the same as the gameplay moments from Diamond Dynasty. I know they <em>can</em> do more unique and interesting things, like when your entire defense sat around you when you pitched as Satchel Paige in The Negro League season 1, and the fact that they don’t do that a lot more feels like a missed opportunity to make the gameplay side of this mode stand out. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Justin's favorite sports games</h3><p>The best sportsball that sportsball has to offer.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other piece that sticks out is the notable absence of an expansive storyline focused on an individual player like we had with Derek Jeter in The Show 24. That extensive look into The Captain wasn’t perfect, but the branching paths and rewards seemed like the next evolution of the Storylines model. It felt like we were just scratching the surface of what Storylines could be, especially when there is no shortage of incredible stories from the last century of baseball history, so The Show 25 not running with that momentum is a tough pill to swallow. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Diamond Dynasty</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Diamond Dynasty, the live service corner of The Show where you gather players via card collecting to form your baseball team, is back with a few excellent changes of its own. First, Sets and Seasons, where cards were only usable during a specific timeframe before being retired in most modes, is officially over, and I am so glad for that. Some great cards are rewarded for grinding through multi-faceted programs, and it never seemed worth putting in the work for players that were going to be forced to the bench eventually. Now if you go through the effort to get the top tier Roger Clemens card from his program, for example, you get to keep it, earn XP to upgrade it, and let your favorites be cornerstones of your team. It’s a very, very good change. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big update is the inclusion of a new single-player mode called Diamond Quest, which is sort of like a roguelite-inspired board game. It sounds strange, but it’s honestly a pretty fun way to play. You roll a die each turn, and every space you cross can hide a gameplay challenge, a reward of some kind, or nothing at all. The objective is to get to the Stadium (or Stadiums), and win a three-inning game there with your squad. If you win, you get to keep the rewards you accumulated and get a chance at a high level card dropping. It’s fun, very replayable since the contents of the tiles are randomized, and pretty generous with its rewards. I particularly appreciate that you get to choose your difficulty for the Stadium games. Sometimes it’s nice to just take the easy win, while other times it’s worth the risk of losing what you picked up by aiming for a harder challenge, since that increases your odds of getting the best drops at the end. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">MLB The Show remains one of the best sports series around. The new upgrade system&nbsp; and the amateur portion of your player’s journey have reinvigorated Road To The Show, while the shift away from Sets and Seasons has righted Diamond Dynasty’s biggest wrong. While it’s a bit of a bummer that the Storylines feature isn’t living up to its full potential, it remains a worthwhile and important inclusion that has reach beyond the game of baseball. All the small touches, such as updated infielder reactions and new quick time events like the swim move, have the on-field action in a great place, too. It’s not always easy for an annual franchise to justify the move to a new entry, but in the case of MLB The Show 25, it does more than enough to make me glad it has arrived.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
