                <p dir="ltr">Dotemu has been at the forefront of a revolution in retro-style 2D throwbacks as of late. Recent hits include updates to classic franchises like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Metal Slug Tactics, and Streets of Rage 4, while the company's porting pedigree also includes the Final Fantasy franchise, as well as multiple Neo Geo titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher is double-dipping into nostalgia in 2025, first with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, and then with Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest collaboration between Dotemu and Tribute Games. After getting some hands-on time with the new sidescrolling arcade superhero beat-'em-up at Summer Game Fest 2025, the evolution of what the two companies built in Shredder's Revenge so far seems worthy of the superhero names it includes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | She-Hulk &amp; Rocket Raccoon Character Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">My demo began with me selecting two heroes from a group of seven available choices: Captain America, Nova, Storm, Venom, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Phyla-Vell. The seven heroes have distinct movesets and abilities--which is a step forward from Shredder's Revenge, where outside of little nuances, each Ninja Turtle you could control functioned essentially the same way.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, I took my dynamic duo into the streets of New York, where I immediately began facing off against the hordes working for villain Annihilus. You control one hero at a time and can swap them at will. Each hero has multiple attacks, ranging from quick jabs to slow but powerful strikes, as well as an arsenal of moves they can execute in the air. You can also combine attack buttons for a super attack, at the cost of some health--which is a mechanic steeped in 2D beat-'em-up history that I absolutely appreciated seeing here again.</p><p dir="ltr">Choosing the right combination of heroes in Marvel Cosmic Invasion seems like it's going to be very important, especially because of the previously-mentioned distinct attributes. Nova, for example, thrives on long-distance combat thanks to his energy wave attacks, while Wolverine prefers to be up close and personal with his claws and powerful throw attack. You can also switch between your two heroes on the fly, which allowed me to tailor my offensive strategy to the situation I was currently facing--if my enemies had ranged attacks, I needed to switch to my long-range attacker, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">This adds an extra layer of strategy to each encounter that helps the entire experience drift away from "mindless button-mashing" to a more measured approach, which benefits the game overall. It also allows for tactical decisions--if my inactive character was really low on health, I could instead call them in as an assist for a single attack, which gave me breathing room during a particularly hectic battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4516633-marvel_cosmic_invasion_screenshot_5.png"

dir="ltr">Fighting enemies looks, sounds, and feels great, with each individual strike making a satisfying "thud" when it connects with an unlucky enemy. The super attacks are particularly flashy, filling the screen with effects as every enemy on the screen is wiped out--I like Storm's electricity the most, as it reminds me of her super move in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, but every hero's super attack has a dash of flair to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo also featured two boss battles, one against the villain Beetle under the influence of one of Annihilus's thralls, and one featuring Taskmaster just being his normal Taskmaster self. Both boss fights followed the classic 2D beat-'em-up boss fight formula--battles that played out in stages, with a giant health bar at the bottom, and the boss using powerful moves for big damage--and both offered a nice challenge at the end of each stage.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I did notice one extra wrinkle in each boss battle: each boss's health bar had a blue frame around it, which I had to remove with attacks before the red health bar would decrease. This represented a sort of "shield" that prevented me from dealing direct damage, and which would occasionally refill at different parts of the fight. The shield mechanic added a bit more difficulty to the battle--even if that difficulty only amounted to a few extra seconds' worth of attacks--but I'm now interested to see how Tribute will continue to iterate on the standard boss battle formula in the full release.</p><p dir="ltr">My time with Marvel Cosmic Invasion went exactly how I expected it to go: I beat up a bunch of enemies, fought some cool bosses, and bathed in a wave of 2D nostalgia thanks to Tribute Games's talent for recreating the arcade feelings of old. While there are a few new elements at play here--more varied character abilities, extra elements in boss battles, and so on--this still feels like a game I would have played and loved in my childhood. Getting that nostalgic feeling right is what will make Marvel Cosmic Invasion a hit when it finally launches, and so far, Tribute has nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Cosmic Invasion is scheduled to release later this year on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> is getting a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> bundle, as a series exec has confirmed there's still a big <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield (2025)</a> reveal set to come this summer.</p>
<p>This Mass Effect bundle comes with various N7-themed skins for both specialists and weapons, with a "Citadel Bundle" containing all Mass Effect cosmetics for 3,000 Battlefield Currency. This comes to roughly £22.50 / $25 in value, though you'd have to buy 2,400 <em>and</em> 1,100 BFC separately. </p>
<p>A few days ahead of the bundle's reveal,  Battlefield Studios' Global Senior Director of Integrated Comms Andy McNamara <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934708241810043104">responded to a fan on Twitter</a> to say the team has "some things brewing", suggesting a reveal of a new game was on the way. Then, following the announcement of the Mass Effect bundle, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">McNamara posted</a>: "The community will know when the reveal is coming. We are focused on Labs and preparing for the reveal this summer".</p>

<p>So there's still something to look forward to in the next month or so. We first learned of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-full-battlefield-reveal-coming-this-summer-as-it-reconfirms-release-window">this summer reveal back in May</a>, as a proper showcase of what the game will look and play like has yet to be produced by the company. The actual name of this new Battlefield is yet to be revealed, an indicator of how much of a mystery the game remains. There have been a series of invite-only playtests, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefields-invite-only-playtest-has-just-begun-and-gameplay-is-already-leaking-online">though information from those has leaked online</a>.</p>
<p>In response, EA stated that "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reminds-battlefield-players-things-taking-place-in-labs-may-or-may-not-make-their-way-to-the-final-game">things taking place in Labs may or may not make their way to the final</a>" game as it cracked down on leakers. Aside from that, all we know is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">EA is still aiming to release the game before April 2026</a>.</p>
<p>One would assume that Summer Game Fest would have been a good time to show off this new Battlefield in earnest, but it appears EA is comfortable taking its time with the game still cooking in the oven. Its absence did however allow Call of Duty to take the spotlight somewhat, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-promises-to-be-most-mind-bending-black-ops-ever">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 wrapping up the Xbox showcase</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-co-op-buddies-assemble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been really impressed with Marvel's video game lineup, recently. I'm not even that big on superheroes, but these games coming from Marvel constantly have me excited -- games like&nbsp;<em>Marvel</em><em>'s Wolverine&nbsp;</em>and the recently announced&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>. Perhaps most of all, though, I'm eager to see the release of the upcoming beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, I was able to play&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;earlier this month at Summer Game Fest 2025. A retro-style beat 'em up with a roster of popular and slightly more niche Marvel heroes, grab a few friends and some brewskies for this one, since you'll be hooked to the CRT all night long.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Diverse Roster to Choose From</h2>

<p>First things first, hero selection. You're not picking one character to play as, but two. You can switch between these in the middle of combat, which makes combat more varied and dynamic. There are 15 heroes in all, so plenty of combinations are possible. So far, Marvel and developer Tribute Games seem pretty tight-lipped on this beat 'em up's roster.</p>

<p>Just recently, we saw the announcement of She-Hulk and Rocket Raccoon as new inclusions to the current selection, that being Spider-Man, Captain America, Venom, Wolverine, Nova, Storm, and Phyla-Vell. Clearly, they're going for a nice mix of heroes here, so really, anyone could show up. Heck, Squirrel Girl or Jeff seem just as likely as Iron Man or Thor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my first playthrough, I went with Captain America and Venom. Any duo should be optimal, though, since this is a beat 'em up, after all. Gameplay is really tight. You could theoretically button mash and be fine, but there's a bit of nuance to each skillset to make every hero feel true to their personality and powers.</p>



<h2>Venom and Captain American = BFFs</h2>

<p>Captain America, for instance, throws his shield and has a strong uppercut to take down pesky air enemies. He's an all-rounder with a decent set of moves, if a bit generic. Great for juggling enemies, though, which I tried my best to do at every chance I could get!</p>

<p>Venom, on the other hand, is this chaotic mass of goo that wreaks havoc on the battlefield. He morphs into different shapes and can take down groups of enemies pretty fast. Despite his size, he's agile both on the ground and while swinging around with his web.</p>



<p>My favorite aspect of Venom,<em>&nbsp;</em>though, is his move that grabs enemies. You can pound bad guys into the ground, or throw them. I was always flinging guys around, throwing them off ledges and wherever else I could have them insta-die. He can grab in mid-air too, so flying enemies better look out.</p>

<p>I played with TechRaptor Editor-in-Chief Andrew Otton, and he went with Spider-Man and Wolverine. He seemed to favor Wolverine, who was just an absolute menace on the battlefield, tearing things up. Now, for our second go-around, I went with two new characters as did Andrew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My new team now comprises Spider-Man and&nbsp;Phyla-Vell. She's a character I'm very unfamiliar with, but her toolkit seems to tick all the right boxes. She floats around and uses her sword to attack. What I really like about&nbsp;Phyla-Vell is that she can throw her sword, and once it hits an enemy, press the button again and she teleports to the sword.</p>



<p>This allows you to travel across the battlefield and meet enemies and reinforcements head-on. I could definitely see her being a mainstay to my team. Andrew also took a liking to Storm who, from a gameplay perspective, seems like another mechanically diverse character. Tribute Games does a good job at making every character shine in their own special ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each character has a special move you can use once a gauge is full, but there's also a sort of tag-team mechanic. It reminds me of&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em>&nbsp;to some degree, where the one character you have benched can come in and land a hit or two; of course, you can always outright switch and play as them with the click of a button.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>&nbsp;is super fast-paced, and so great to play with others. I like that there's more to it than just simple button mashing, and I can't wait to see what combinations I can make once the full roster is revealed. Really, if you enjoyed the developer's previous beat 'em up,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge,&nbsp;</em>you'll like this just as much, if not even more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion, and if you're a fan of adorably indistinct fox-cat-dog 'mon Eevee, then you're going to love this one.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/its-a-cuteness-overload-in-pokemon-tcg-pockets-upcoming-eevee-grove-expansion" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th, bringing with it new cards based on Eevee and many of its evolutions (colloquially referred to as Eeveelutions, for obvious reasons).</p>

<p>The expansion, which follows on from previous large-scale expansions like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow">Celestial Guardians</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-update-new-expansion-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Space-Time Smackdown</em></a>, will introduce more than 100 new cards to collect, including an Eevee ex card with the adorably-named ability "Veevee 'volve". All together now: d'awwww.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove-expansion-eevee-ex.jpg?itok=EqFp3FxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-eevee-grove-expansion-eevee-ex.jpg?itok=wJRUIxLs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Eevee and its chums are the focus of the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>Other cards we've seen so far include a very cute full-art Leafeon and a Vaporeon in repose, as well as cards based on other Eeveelutions like Umbreon, Flareon, and Sylveon. In short, if you're a fan of Eevee and its subsequent forms, you're going to love this.</p>

<p>Of course, it's not just Eevee; you'll also find a new Trainer card in the form of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet</em>'s Penny, who allows you to look at a random Supporter card in your opponent's deck (as long as it isn't Penny) and steal its effect, as well as shuffling that card back into the deck.</p>

<p>A new Eevee Bag item is also being added as a Trainer card, which buffs Eeveelutions and allows you to heal them as well. If you're building an Eevee-centric deck, you'll want this as part of your arsenal.</p>




<p>If you're not a fan of Eevee...well, first, I'd urge you to check your priorities and get the help you need. Assuming you don't want to do that, however, you'll find other 'mons included in this expansion, like Swirlix, Alcremie, and Milcery.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Eevee Grove&nbsp;</em>expansion launches on June 26th. Stay tuned for more on all things&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/688568/summer-game-fest-2025-los-angeles-ice-arrests<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I love going to Summer Game Fest. It’s a rare opportunity to connect with my colleagues and friends in person, as well as listen to developers talk about why they make their games. In some ways, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/679598/summer-game-fest-2025-trailers-news">this year’s SGF gave me everything I love about the event</a>. But while I was comfortably ensconced in a happy bubble, the escalating conflict between demonstrators protesting against immigration raids and the Los Angeles Police Department cast a dark and soul-shaking pall that could not be ignored. </p><p>Everything started on June 6th, when it was reported that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had conducted a raid in LA’s fashion district, the same area where most of SGF was being held. I wasn’t around to experience that because I was at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California, watching Geoff Keighley announce a <em>Game of Thrones</em> RTS and a Wu-Tang game. But when Ian Proulx, <em>Splitgate 2</em> creator and CEO of 1047 Games, came out with his <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684957/splitgate-2-hat-apology">now-infamous “Make FPS Great Again” hat</a>, it punctured the illusion of distance in time, space, and tone.</p><p>In the months since President Donald Trump took office, ICE has ramped up its activities, sending agents to snatch parents from their children and children from their schools, enabled under the auspices that removing immigrants will be what makes America great again. Proulx’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682033/everybody-hated-that">hat became the story of the day</a>, if not the whole event. It was the main topic of conversation at the lobby bar of the JW Marriott hotel, where each night of SGF is capped off with a mixer. How could someone choose to reference such a statement, even in jest or irony, as the very people that slogan has been used to target are being snatched up mere blocks away?</p><p>Saturday was business as usual. Proulx’s hat was forgotten as I settled in to work, flitting between wall-to-wall appointments checking out <em>Escape Academy 2</em>, the new <em>Lego Party</em> game, and <em>Deadpool VR </em>with no time to chat or even eat. I didn’t check my phone for hours, and every TV was playing a video game. I had no idea what was happening both in Los Angeles and in the White House. But when there was finally a lull, I popped online, where I was greeted with a deluge of messages from people who <em>were</em> watching the news, telling me that something (a nebulous, undefined, but nevertheless urgent something) was happening and that I needed to get back to the safety of my hotel.</p><p>Thankfully, my worst fears about martial law declarations and curfews didn’t come to pass while I was there, but they did after I was back home. People had taken to the streets of LA in protest of ICE action and began moving through parts of the city, demonstrating and occasionally clashing with the police (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-waymo/682932/la-protest-waymo-fire-destroy-ice-police">and autonomous vehicles</a>). But at that moment, when I was hearing that insurrection acts were going to be invoked and that the National Guard was being mobilized to sweep the city, I became legitimately scared — particularly for attendees who weren’t citizens and those with immigrant families. </p><div><p>How could someone choose to reference such a statement, even in jest or irony?</p></div><p>One such colleague, Janet Garcia, <a href="https://pentopixels.com/article/summer-game-fest-2025-ice-protests-la">wrote an incredible account</a> of what it was like working SGF and being the child of a Mexican immigrant. Her words right now are more important than mine. SGF also coincided with the BET Awards, and honoree Doechii also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/10/arts/music/doechii-trump-protests-bet-awards.html">had a powerful message for the moment</a>. </p><p>There had already been several stories of international travelers being detained in the US for weeks, and I was scared that if something was happening, my journalist friends from Canada, the UK, and elsewhere could get caught in the mix. Word began spreading that something (again, what that was, nobody could say, and that uncertainty compounded the fear) was happening, and my friends and I all began to start asking aloud: do we need to leave? Some said yes, and I was ready to do just that, but something stopped me.</p><p>I will never be able to adequately express how weird my job is in situations like this. It’s really hard to write about the colorful pixels on a TV when it feels like the world is seconds away from catching fire. And yet I do it every day. Right when I was about to make the decision to leave early, a Capcom PR rep tapped me on the shoulder. I was late to my <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appointment. And I went, because in that scary moment I still thought, “I have a job to do.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata">I did my best with <em>Requiem</em></a>, plodding along the abandoned hospital, being suitably impressed by how the sound of Grace’s footsteps changed when she walked on the wooden floor vs. the floor covered in bits of broken drywall. But my phone kept buzzing with notifications throughout it all. Midway through the demo, my stress was so high from the ambient spookiness of the game and all the happenings outside the SGF bubble that I couldn’t take it anymore. I made my profuse apologies to my PR contact (who was exceedingly gracious and understanding) and left. </p><p>The mood that night at the hotel was less exuberant. It wasn’t just everything going on in LA: the mood of the event itself was the lowest I’d ever seen it in the handful of years that SGF has served as E3’s smaller, vibe-ier replacement. There were games there, good ones, but nothing big enough to anchor the show. As the industry faces its third straight year of rampant layoffs, cancellations, delays, and studio closures we’re finally starting to see the pipeline of blockbuster games dry up. This was a stark contrast to last year when Sega had <em>Metaphor: ReFantanzio </em>and <em>Shadow Generations</em>, Bandai Namco showed off <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, PlayStation was there with <em>Astro Bot</em>, and Xbox had just announced <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p><p>I’m home now. And despite this year’s strangeness, I look forward to going back to Summer Game Fest. Because if video games have taught me anything over the years, it’s that in the face of overwhelming odds, the best thing one can do is stick together with your friends.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A bunch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> coverage has surfaced from the internet's soup pot like the bones of that beloved pet hamster you thought had escaped through the scullery. Quickly now, before your darling children see, let's sift through the remains in search of News. Well now! It turns out they're keeping the jokes to a relative minimum in this one. So says Taylor Clark, Borderlands 4's lead writer, in a chat about the game's lush dystopian setting.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's been interesting, perhaps a little depressing to see the Borderlands school of humour degrade over the years from a moderate strength into a definite weakness. Ah, I remember how much we used to love Claptrap. I remember how delighted we all were by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3ehmPeLtdQ">the Wimoweh trailer</a>. I was, anyway. This was back in 2012, when I still enjoyed video games. </p>
<p>Specific hits and misses aside, I guess the basic problem is that you can only do this vein of post-post-ironic, meme-shot chucklefuckery once or twice before it becomes nauseating. There are seven Borderlands games, including spin-offs. I think that is probably four too many - if you've played the second, I'd skip straight to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-from-the-borderlands">Tales From The Borderlands</a>. </p>
<p>Gearbox are, among other things, trying to level the tone out with Borderlands 4, which launches for PC on 12th September, and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1285190/eventcomments/603033240727512637?snr=1_5_9_">will not cost $80</a>, despite or possibly thanks to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/randy-pitchford-shows-hes-capable-of-not-being-an-idiot-about-borderlands-4-prices-raising-questions-about-previous-insistence-on-being-an-idiot">much commentary to that effect from Gearboss Randy Pitchford</a>.</p>
<p>"Of course, we were aware of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-3-review">the feedback that Borderlands 3 got</a>, and we took all the valid criticism on board," Clark <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/gearbox-talks-borderlands-4-exploration-fixing-the-meme-humor-and-entering-the-series-simpsons-era/">said of the humour</a> in an interview with VGC. "We're creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet we're on. Pandora was like the Wild West, this new planet is a totalitarian world, so having everybody making jokes every minute wouldn't feel totally right."</p>
<p>That last sentence is, well, it's sort of a Pandora's box, isn't it. Many thoughts, all of them massively obnoxious. On the one hand, <a href="https://lithub.com/is-humor-the-best-antidote-to-tyranny/">humour may be the best antidote to tyranny</a>, on the other, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/07/24/boris-johnson-plays-clown-hes-really-just-power-hungry-nihilist/">clowns can make great demagogues</a>. It's hard to comment without knowing more about Borderlands 4's idea of totalitarianism. I guess I need to play it now.</p>
<p>There's also the problem of this being Borderlands' "Simpson's era", in Clark's words, although I think he's actually referring to the "Simpsons did it" joke from South Park.</p>
<p>"We're in the writers' room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, 'We did that in Borderlands'," he told the site. "We're always trying not to repeat ourselves; that's why our villains are so different. We're always trying to keep it fresh."</p>
<p>If you never played any of the older Borderlands, 1) I'd be sincerely interested to get your impressions of the 2009 game, and 2) Borderlands 4 is going to be a "fresh start", continuing the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> "with a very different kind of villain than we've had before". According to Clark: "You don't need to have played all the old games to understand it, but you have something that rewards people who are coming from Borderlands 3 and also people who want to jump in, with no experience."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"We took all the valid criticism on board. We're creating an entirely new world, and we want to have a tone that fits the new planet we're on."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official New Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Borderlands 3's world of Pandora was like "the Wild West," but the planet of Kairos for Borderlands 4 is a "totalitarian world." As such, "Having everybody making jokes every minute wouldn't totally feel right," Clark said. This follows on from the game's narrative director saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">fans should not expect Skibidi toilet or Hawk Tuah jokes in Borderlands 4.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, senior project producer Anthony Nicholson told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">GameSpot </a>that Gearbox is "really proud" of its past titles and the jokes and general humor in them. However, Nicholson said the world is different today, in 2025, and while Borderlands 4 aims to be "very humorous," the humor is trying to be more grounded.</p><p>"We now make sure that the Vault Hunters themselves are the ones who are driving [the jokes] and they're the ones who are being [funny]. So when we say [Borderlands 4] has grounded humor, we mean it's more situational comedy between [the Vault Hunters] as opposed to pulling things out from the real world and things like that [like the series used to]," Nicholson explained.</p><h2><strong>Simpsons era</strong></h2><p>Clark went on to say that Gearbox is entering its "Simpsons era" with Borderlands 4, in that the studio has written so much material over the years that it's a big job to try to find new storytelling.</p><p>"We're in the writers' room, and somebody will have an idea on how to finish a mission, and someone will be like, 'We did that in Borderlands,'" he said. "We're always trying not to repeat ourselves; that's why our villains are so different. We're always trying to keep it fresh."</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 launch lined up for sometime later. The game's standard edition costs $70, not $80--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/" data-ref-id="1100-6532526">this makes Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford very happy.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo has released the first major post-launch patch for its Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>. Patch Ver. 1.1.1 is primarily focused on bug fixes, rather than adding any substantial new content.</p><p>Like most first-party Nintendo titles, Mario Kart World felt very refined and polished at release, with GameSpot calling it a "massive, sprawling sequel that playfully expands and iterates on the qualities that made Mario Kart 8 Deluxe such an enduring success," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">in our review</a>. Still, some bugs still slipped through the cracks, like ones that occasionally prevented items from being used, crashed the game after watching a replay or doing an Online Play race, or couldn't properly control your character in Free Roam. You can check out the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list of patch notes</a> below:</p><h2>Fixed Issues</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where items were no longer able to be used.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes controls were inoperable when selecting a character and trying to start Free Roam from the “Free Roam” map.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down when watching replay after a race.</li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes the game shut down after a race in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Knockout Tour” and “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where it was easy for a communication error to occur when trying to join Friends playing “VS Race” or “Battle” in “Online Play.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes slipped through the wall before the finish line of “DK Spaceport.”</li><li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes couldn’t return to correct position after falling of the course between “Airship Fortress” and “Bowser’s Castle” while gliding.</li></ul><p>If you were hoping that Ver. 1.1.1 of Mario Kart World would add some new content to Free Roam or any of the other modes, you're out of luck. At this time, Nintendo has not revealed any post-launch update plans for Mario Kart World outside of these bug-fixing patches.</p><p>This update is out now and should automatically download. If it doesn't, make sure you're connected to the internet and press the + or - button on your controller over Mario Kart World's game icon. From there, navigate to the Software Update sub-menu and choose to update "Via the Internet."</p><p>Mario Kart World is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2. There's a lot to discover in the game, including the iconic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-decades-old-nintendo-easter-egg-has-surfaced-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532489/" data-ref-id="1100-6532489">Totaka's Song easter egg</a> common in Nintendo games and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-harkens-back-to-super-mario-64-for-unlocking-free-roam-mirror-mode/1100-6532313/" data-ref-id="1100-6532313">Mirror Mode</a> that flips the entirety of the Free Roam open world.  </p>

The pause — which the company lifted April 24 — was a short-term play, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Just pausing pre-orders, but not doing anything else, just buys you time to observe,” said Joseph Fitzgerald, managing director and partner at Boston Consulting Group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although Nintendo went full steam ahead with its plans following the pre-order pause, many consumer goods companies have been taking more long-term wait-and-see approaches to tariffs, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.supplychaindive.com/news/prologis-warehouse-outlook-tariffs/745829/">some stockpiling inventory</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to delay more drastic actions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s unclear how Nintendo handled the initial tariff shock beyond the pause, as the company did not respond to a request for comment. However, according to Sally Peng, senior managing director and leader of export controls, sanctions and trade for the Asia-Pacific region at FTI Consulting, it may have built up a certain amount of Switch 2 inventory ahead of launch to ensure it could meet the initial rush.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Strategizing for the long term">Strategizing for the long term</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no quick fix to stave off the impact of tariffs for consumer electronics makers like Nintendo, however.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just moving a single company’s production operation would be challenging enough, according to Fitzgerald. It takes roughly nine to 12 months to move production to different geographies, he said, and that’s just the start. Companies often want to be using a facility for five to 10 years to be confident it can meet demand and quality standards sufficiently for a device like the Switch 2, he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the level of complexity required to shift production, consumer electronics makers in North America are putting a lot of “calories” into rebalancing, Fitzgerald added. Locations that are receiving the most attention include Latin America, eastern Europe and countries in Southeast Asia beyond China.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving production to the U.S. is another option, but complications remain even if a company like Nintendo were to invest in such a move.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You end up having to have this discussion around, hey, can you also mirror our supply chain in this location, or are you going to continue to provide from an outside the United States location, and what is our cost difference?” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Relocating a company’s own production footprint is challenging enough. But game console makers rely on thousands of components and coordinate with large partner ecosystems to make devices that can be sold at consumer-friendly prices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“That Tier 2, Tier 3 alignment in these locations is really the biggest thing that’s under threat when you’re kind of vacillating in policy,” Fitzgerald said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The total supply chain costs of different tariff strategies will determine which long-term gambits electronics manufacturers make in response to a shifting global trade environment.

Most surprisingly, though, Nintendo Switch 2 owners with Donkey Kong Bananza can use GameShare to let a Switch 1 player join their game and play as Donkey Kong's companion, Pauline. This means that technically, a Switch player who maybe hasn't upgraded to Nintendo's latest console can still check out the game.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Donkey Kong Bananza Direct, Nintendo revealed that you can share a second Joy-Con 2 controller, or a second set entirely, to let another player control Pauline separately from Donkey Kong. They can unleash Vocal Blasts using the Joy-Con 2 Mouse controls. And, with GameShare, you only need one copy of the game to participate in the co-op action because you can share Donkey Kong Bananza with another Switch 2 owner. This can be done locally, even to a Switch 1 player, or via an online connection to another Switch 2 owner using GameShare via GameChat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>GameShare is already a nice consumer-friendly feature, and something we're glad has returned from the DS era in the Switch 2 generation.

<p>So it's finally here...</p>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza DK and Pauline" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d12d2d176cb2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-and-pauline.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>We shouldn't be surprised that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is stuffed full of musical references. After all, if you're playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> right now, you <em>know</em> Nintendo is going all-in on its musical history right now (it has always, but right now, we're eating). We heard many a classic DK track during the Direct, but one in particular stood out to us.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, it's the DK Rap folks. Originally composed by Rare's Grant Kirkhope for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, it's made numerous appearances throughout Donkey Kong's life, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_smash_bros_melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a> and beyond, and it's back once again in Bananza.</p><p><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEee42ub-Hw">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You'll hear it at around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YVUidGTR8xg?si=LBDQwDyQDU_qSMR2&amp;t=780">13 minutes in</a>, when the Direct is covering the music player. The beat is unmistakable, but if you're still unsure, you'll here that classic "D.K. Donkey. Kong" shortly after.</p>
<p>Interestingly, on the music player, the song <em>might</em> be titled 'Getaway', so it may be a remix of some kind, and we've just heard a little snippet? It could also just be a totally different track, and the DK Rap is playing on top. We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>While we've heard a few original songs, including that lovely new vocal theme, and some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a> arrangements, but we can't wait to see what else we'll hear in game.</p>
<p>While Bananza seems to be stuffed full of homages, there's tons of new stuff to be excited about, too, including a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-gets-a-new-amiibo-nintendo-details-how-they-work-in-dk-bananza">new amiibo</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/donkey-kong-bananza-features-two-player-co-op-and-you-can-even-gameshare-to-switch-1">co-op (with GameShare)</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/check-out-donkey-kong-bananzas-all-new-kong-cast-members-and-animal-transformations">some new Kongs</a>, and transformations.</p>

<figure><a title="DKB Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d0cc56d142177/dkb-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Well, well, well. We're just fresh from taking in everything that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/watch-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-direct-live">Nintendo's <strong>Donkey Kong Bananza</strong> Direct</a> has shown us about the incoming Switch 2 game, and there's quite a lot of very exciting things to discuss!</p>
<p>Amongst these are the game's all-new Kong cast members alongside Donkey Kong's brand new 'Bananza Transformation' abilities. As shown in the action-packed 15-minute Direct (which has now got us properly buzzing for a game some of us weren't 100% sold on), this new iteration of DK has a bevvy of smart tricks and evil faces up its furry sleeves.</p>
<p>We got a look at a handful of new characters to add to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVedHG4bRSg">the burgeoning cast of Kongs</a> that've accumulated over the decades. Here it's the turn of the apparent villains of the piece, 'Void Company'. These three brand new characters are <strong>Void Kong</strong>, the leader guy, <strong>Grumpy Kong</strong>, who seems quite angry about something, and <strong>Poppy Kong</strong>, who likes to stretch.</p>


<p>According to the Direct, these villains are blocking up the sinkholes that Donkey Kong and his sidekick, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/say-hello-to-pauline-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Pauline</a>, need to use to travel down through the worlds that make up the game's amazing-looking levels. We are, after all, on an adventure right to the earth's core, and so the miasma being inflicted by sinkholes must be cleared by our heroes. Sounds like a job for a big, smashy ape and a singer, alright.</p>

<p>Also shown off were Donkey Kong's all-new 'Bananza' transformational abilities. We are loving the look of these and the fact they can be switched between freely when you've got them activated (by collecting up golden coins). It seems as though this game is going to go large on letting players mess around, experiment, and break things as they see fit.</p>
<p>The gameplay introduced three transformations, each one based on one of the game's 'Elder Kongs' (that's boss dudes to you and us). So, we've got <strong>Ostrich Bananza</strong>, a flying transformation that allows you to drop egg bombs on foes. Then we have <strong>Zebra Bananza</strong>, a speeding variant of DK which can blast across fragile surfaces. And finally <strong>Kong Bananza</strong>, which is a souped-up version of DK that can do even more damage than normal.</p>


<p>Bananza transformations work on a timer, so you can't run wild as you'd like, but we sure do like the look of how crazy this new adventure seems to let players get. And we already can't wait to use DK's new swing ability to leather Void Company around the chops with a big old chunk of concrete. In a non-violent way, you understand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-pauline-gameplay-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo kicked off today with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVUidGTR8xg&amp;t=2221s">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct</a> presentation, which showcased a bunch of new gameplay details about the upcoming adventure, but perhaps most importantly, revealed that the Odd Rock character we met when the game was first revealed back in April, isn't a rock at all - it's Pauline.</p>
<p>It's not the Pauline we know from Super Mario Odyssey, though—it's Pauline as a young child, with dreams of becoming a singer. Before that can happen, however, she needs to make it back to the surface. Stopping Void Kong and his crew from reaching the planet's core and getting Pauline back to the surface seems to be the driving narrative force in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?start=2221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The direct showcased how Pauline and DK will work together, with DK using his strength to pound, grab, smash, and throw nearly everything around him, using the game's environmental destruction core gameplay concept to carve new paths, and create new paths by reassembling bits of the environment in some cases.</p>
<p>While Pauline uses her voice to manipulate the environment to solve puzzles, and with the help of Giant Elders teaching Pauline and DK their Bananza-powers, Pauline can transform DK into three new forms. The first transformation is Kong Bananza, which makes DK a bigger, stronger gorilla, capable of smashing parts of the world that normal-sized DK can't, and if you can believe it, causing even more chaos.</p>
<p>The other two transformations are Zebra and Ostrich Bananza. When DK transforms into his Zebra form, he's much faster, can run along water, and run across platforms that would otherwise crumble under normal DK, who wouldn't be fast enough to make it across without falling.</p>
<p>Ostrich Bananza gives DK the ability to fly, reaching heights DK otherwise wouldn't be able to reach, and drop egg bombs on enemies as you take to the skies.&nbsp;You can swap between each transformation, and activate them whenever you like, so long as you have a full Bananergy-meter, an energy meter you fill by collecting gold.</p>
<figure>

	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>We also got a look at a few of the collectibles players will search for, like Banandium Gems, which can also be collected in smaller Banandium Chips form. There's also gold, collectible fossils, and challenge courses to find to earn more Banandium Gems, which can in turn become skill points, which was another major gameplay reveal.</p>
<p>DK has plenty of abilities players can take advantage of, whether that's smashing the environment, using chunks of the world to surf along the ground or on water, or double-jump, and they can all be upgraded through earning and spending skill points.</p>
<p>Pauline is also a playable character in Donkey Kong Bananza's two-player co-op mode, though it doesn't look like she's capable of getting off DK's back. All she can do is send vocal blasts out to various parts of the environment, helping DK out in puzzle solving and combat.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza also supports game share with other Nintendo Switch devices, which means that you can play the co-op mode with a friend, even if that person doesn't have their own copy of Donkey Kong Bananza. Game share works with Switch 2 devices locally or over online play, though it seems to only work with Switch 1 consoles through local game sharing.</p>
<p>The full direct was nearly 18 minutes, and in that time Nintendo showed off a lot about Donkey Kong Bananza, including plenty more depth than the game's first previews showcased.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch previewed the game</a>, he wrote, "<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>This direct made it clear that there's plenty of potential in DK's abilities, and it'll be interesting to see in the full game how far Nintendo takes them all. In the meantime, we await that full release on July 17, 2025.</p>

I have learned, in preparation for this article, that this arcade classic had a different name in the U.S. “<em>Speed Buggy.”</em> Pah-tooie. Ew. No. It’s <em>Buggy Boy</em>, and it was—until 2025—the only racing game that recognized the vital importance of driving a car on two wheels. Now that <em>Mario Kart World</em> has revived this core conceit, it’s time to give Tatsumi Electronics’ all-time classic the recognition it deserves.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Honestly, what is it with you Americans and your determination to choose a completely rubbish version of something the rest of the world does differently? The imperial system? Fahrenheit? Putting your dates in an entirely random order? And <em>Speed Buggy</em>?! No. It was <em>Bagī Bōi </em>(バギーボーイ) in Japan, and that just flat-out translates to <em>Buggy Boy</em>. <em>Speed Buggy</em> was a 1973 crossover cartoon with <em>Josie and the Pussycats </em>for Hanna-Barbera. The matter is resolved. I accept your apology.</p><p><em>Buggy Boy</em> was first released as an arcade game in Japan in 1985, including in a cockpit cabinet with a three-screen display. Come 1987 it was ported across to the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC, before being realized in its perfect version in 1988 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga and Atari ST. It was then that a 10-year-old John Walker played that game until the digital tyres (yes, <em>tyres</em>—“tires” means to get sleepy) wore thin. </p><p>Because my dad was flawed, we had an Atari ST instead of an Amiga, and as such were left with all the crappy gaming magazines and the desperate, unconvincing cry of “But it’s used by professional music producers!” But at least I also had <em>Buggy Boy</em>, the first game to understand that all vehicular racing is improved when tipped on one side.</p><p><em>Buggy Boy</em> was, as you might suspect from the year it was released, a relatively simple racing game—relative to today. At the time, it was positively intricate, primarily because of the clutter on the roads. Rather than your generic racetrack of games like <em>Pole Position</em>, empty save for the presence of other cars, on the mean non-streets of <em>BB</em> you were faced with all manner of obstacles, from logs and rocks to barriers and piles of bricks. At the same time, the five different tracks were covered in flags to drive into and banners to drive under, to score extra points, and—most importantly—means by which you could cause your car to both jump <em>and</em> flip up on its side onto two wheels.</p><p>It’s so important to remember that this is a full seven years before <em>Super Mario Kart</em> would appear on SNES, and while <em>Buggy Boy</em> was a single-player game with a single car on the tracks, I find it impossible not to trace a lineage. The madcap nature of <em>Mario</em>’s courses, while certainly born of <em>F-Zero</em>, still feel somewhat inspired by <em>Buggy Boy</em> to me. And yet I never hear a soul mention this game, ever.</p><p>Just the ability to jump, I think, marks out <em>BB</em> as special. Cars—and stay with me here—cannot jump. They can be <em>launched</em>, certainly, but their ability to hop up into the air by means of driving over a log has yet to be recorded in nature. It’s a gloriously silly feature that too many racing games would have eschewed, in favor of “realism.” But nothing was better than when you drove over a slanty small rock in the road and tipped up on two wheels.</p><figure id="" data-id="ab5ccfb55879f493166e85b71a26e05f" data-recommend-id="image://ab5ccfb55879f493166e85b71a26e05f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="757" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The buggy on two wheels in front of piles of bricks?

The effect lasted until you hit any other obstacle or feature, and as your buggy plopped down onto four wheels once more, your heart sank with it, a new high score likely missed.</p><p>Playing <em>Mario Kart World—</em>a game I’m honestly struggling to love (despite playing as a Cheep Cheep)—every time I find myself grinding a railing, fence or barrier, seeing my kart tip up diagonally, I just feel a nostalgic hit of delight. This! This is what’s been missing from racing games for nearly 40 years! It makes me happy, the way hearing a long-forgotten song you loved in your teenage years can wrap you in the emotions of memory.</p><p>There was so much more to it, too! You had to collect the colored flags in the order shown on screen, for bonuses, and the time gates were vital to ensure you could keep playing (complete with the on-screen symbols that I always parsed as Monopoly cards). Then there was the range of track offerings: an offroad track you’d loop around five times, as well as four other unique courses each made up of five distinct stages. It had that <em>Mario Kart</em>-like map to keep you focused, and have I mentioned how much I love going up on two wheels?</p><p><em>Buggy Boy </em>has never received the love and recognition it deserves. Where are the modern remakes? The arcade classic celebrations? The misguided attempt to reboot the franchise as a first-person shooter? Let this be the game’s clarion call.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is the next big Switch 2 game, landing firmly within "launch window" status next month. Nintendo took the wraps off DKB with a rapid-fire presentation detailing its story, features, Amiibo support, and more, and altogether it looks like a dang hoot. Donkey Kong can go Super Saiyajin or turn into a zebra, there's a cabal of evil capitalist Kongs, he collects <em>Bananergy</em>. High marks across the board. The story elements, though, appear to raise some pretty serious questions about our understanding of Donkey Kong lore. That's right, I said "Donkey Kong lore" with a straight face. Buckle up, kids.</p><p dir="ltr">The Donkey Kong Bananza presentation opened with introducing young Pauline, a budding singer who we know from Super Mario Odyssey would go on to be mayor of New Donk City. In this game she looks no more than 10 years old or so and hangs off DK's back as a companion character. Pauline has a dream, and DK is being exploited by his capitalist overlords, so together they head toward the planet core to make a wish. All completely normal so far.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, the presence of a young Pauline implies that this is a prequel of sorts. DK has been rehabilitated from his villainous persona in the original Donkey Kong for years, but buddying up with Pauline as a little girl suggests that there was more to the story than we knew. As of the time when DK grabbed her and carried her to the top of a tower and forced Jump Man (aka Mario) to rescue her, they had a history. They were old friends! The mind reels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517074"></a><figcaption>In Soviet Russia, monkey has person on his back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4517074-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_09.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But then, the Bananza presentation threw another curveball by revealing that you can meet Cranky Kong. Now wait just a damn minute. What the hell is going on here?</p><p dir="ltr">As DK enthusiasts may recall, Cranky Kong is canonically the <em>original</em> Donkey Kong: The DK we've been playing throughout the Donkey Kong Country games, the one who is pals with Diddy Kong and the rest, is actually his more charismatic grandson. It was Cranky Kong who grabbed Pauline and climbed the tower and squared off against Jump Man.</p><p dir="ltr">So you may start to see the problem here. If old Cranky Kong is in this game, Pauline should be an adult. If Pauline is a kid, then Donkey Kong should be a slightly younger Cranky Kong who, 10 or so years in the future, will grab her and climb a bunch of girders. Having a fully-aged Cranky Kong and a young girl Pauline appear in the same game makes <em>absolutely no sense</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are ways to make it work. Donkey Kong Bananza could imply some kind of time-travel element in which Cranky Kong was sucked back into the past to meet his younger self. That possibility seems bananas, but frankly no more so than anything else we've seen from this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The more likely possibility in my mind, though, is that this version of Donkey Kong, Pauline, and Cranky Kong are entirely separate and distinct from the precious original continuity. Donkey Kong Bananza appears to be a sort of DK reboot, remixing familiar elements into a new continuity that is not bound by any of the storytelling conventions of the original. In other words: We've entered the DK multiverse.</p><p dir="ltr">Or maybe Nintendo is just making it up as they go. I may be overthinking this.</p>
