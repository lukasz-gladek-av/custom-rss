            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off 3% of employees, taken from across all levels, teams and regions that the tech giant works in.</p>
<p>In what will be the biggest set of job cuts since early 2023, this will affect around 6,800 jobs –&nbsp;if we take 3% from the 228,000 strong workforce that the company had in June 2024.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">a statement to CNBC</a>, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”</p>
<p>These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said, which is in contrast to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html">more targeted cuts made back in January</a>. Of course, blanket percentage job cuts couldn’t really be performance related, especially when Microsoft just announced better-than-expected quarterly results, with $24.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast.</p>
<p>That said, given the gigantic scale of the company, the number of markets that it tries to serve and how various different departments could be performing in relation to one another, some of these job cuts could serve to optimise internal structure. It just absolutely sucks that there’s seemingly no good reason for this – good quarter, bad quarter, good economic outlook, bad economic outlook, it doesn’t seem to make a difference these days.</p>

<p>For Microsoft’s now sprawling gaming empire, the impact will likely look like hundreds of job losses. Having ballooned in size thanks to the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard in recent years, Microsoft made job cuts over the last few years with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">1,900 job losses in early 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed studios like Arkane and Tango Gameworks</a> (which was later rescued), split off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-but-promises-no-studio-closures-or-game-cancellations/">then cut a further 650 jobs</a> last September.</p>
<p>One thing that could help preserve jobs is that a number of studios and teams within Microsoft are unionising. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">the World of Warcraft team last July</a>, and testers at Bethesda and Raven, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">the Overwatch team at Blizzard unionised last week</a>, meaning that the wall-to-wall team of 200 employees will be able to bargain collectively and have some ability to push back against layoffs such as this. Of course, while Microsoft should be recognised for not engaging in union-busting activities, they have also been very slow to actually respond and negotiate with these unions under their umbrella.</p>

The R-rated original live-action horror flick starring Michael B. Jordan (in two roles) brought in more than $120 million domestically over its first three weekends. <em>Sinners </em>even made more money its second weekend than its first, a very rare feat in modern Hollywood. And now it’s pulled off another impressive trick at the box office.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>The Wrap</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Sinners </em>is the first original Hollywood film to bring in over $200 million domestically since Pixar’s <em>Coco</em> in 2017. But that’s an animated flick from Disney, and those tend to do pretty well across the board. If you want to find the last time an original live-action Hollywood movie crossed $200 million at the box office, you have to do go all the way back to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013's <em>Gravity</em></a></span>. The space thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney earned an incredible $275 million domestically.

It’s better than <em>Avatar</em> and its sequel. But in terms of sheer box office revenue, I doubt it can compete with James Cameron’s uber-blockbuster. </p><p>That doesn’t change the fact that <em>Sinners</em> is a big hit and will hopefully convince Hollywood that original movies featuring sex that star and are created by Black people can do well in 2025. You don’t have to keep pumping out comic book slop to make money. The people yearn for new, horny movies. Give them what they want. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Studios have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/">announced</a> a Galactic Emergency, as the Illuminate have begun their "<em>true</em>" invasion, with their goal being to hit Super Earth directly.</p>
<p>The new update adds new enemies for Super Earth's defenders to squash in the name of freedom, including Stingrays, which are described as "<em>jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky</em>," and the Crescent Overseer, which specializes in attacking Helldivers who are trying to regroup and take cover.</p>
<p>The third new enemy is the one we get the best look at in the trailer for the Galactic Emergency update, the Fleshmob, which looks like what you'd think something called 'Fleshmob' would look like. A big pile of organic matter with more arms than anyone should ever have stomping around in an unsightly manner.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Galactic Emergency Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bO9qCGVQsFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To combat these new foes, Helldivers will have new methods of customizing their weapons, with primary weapons now featuring different attachments that can be unlocked by achieving new levels for each primary weapon. Once you've hit the required level for a weapon, you can unlock the attachment through Requisition, according to the PlayStation Blog post. Customizations range from being able to adjust ammo capacity, muzzles, and add under-barrel attachments. You'll also be able to unlock new cosmetic customizations for your weapons.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Arrowhead also announced that new patterns for previously released Warbonds will be released on May 15, 2025, alongside the launch of the latest Warbond, Masters of Ceremony.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 was one of the biggest games in 2024, and one of the year's biggest surprises, since no one was looking to its release as one of the marquee launches of the year, until it launched and absolutely exploded in popularity. It is easily the biggest success story regarding Sony's live service efforts, which is interesting to note given the context that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-praises-sony-for-their-creative-freedom-was-inspired-by-no-mans-skys-comeback/">as Arrowhead chief executive officer Shams Jorjani said earlier this year,</a> Sony and PlayStation have let Arrowhead steer the ship with Helldivers 2.</p>

            <p>
More than two years on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/microsoft">Microsoft's</a> last mass round of layoffs, the company is laying off a huge amount of staff once again. As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">CNBC</a>, the tech giant is laying off 3% of employees across the entire company, meaning all levels, teams, and geographies. While nothing has been directly confirmed as of yet, this does include the possibility that some games studios it owns will be affected too - we'll provide an update if there is one.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to CNBC, a Microsoft spokesperson said that the company will "continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace." The spokesperson also said that one objective of the layoffs is to reduce layers of management. As always, a ridiculously heartless way to frame such a thing. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As of last June, Microsoft had around 228,000 employees, meaning a little under 7000 workers could be out of work soon. This is by far the biggest round of layoffs the company has enacted since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">January 2023</a>, though 650 workers were put out of employment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">last September too</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that these layoffs come after Microsoft reported that its net income increased by 18% year-on-year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-report-2025.html">just this April</a>. Doesn't exactly scream a company that desperately needs to make cuts.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's unclear if any games studios under Microsoft's ownership have been affected by this decision. But as a reminder, based on the stats of an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">unofficial games industry layoffs tracker</a>, so far this year there's been an estimated 2200 jobs lost. 2024 saw around 14,600, 2023 around 10,500, and 2022 around 8500. Good luck to those affected.

A remake of the 2004 JRPG The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, this new version follows the same adventure led by Joshua and Estelle, but with 3D graphics, new gameplay mechanics, and more quality of life improvements. You can preorder the game now at a variety of retailers (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9gb1wn?object_uuid=d322f80e-b065-4000-bd5a-9ce4369dfd33&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).

It didn’t make its way to the West until 2011, when it came out here for PlayStation Portable. The game has two direct sequels, Trails in the Sky SC and Trails in the Sky the 3rd. The overarching Legend of Heroes series spans much more time, with entries releasing between the 1980s and now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter is a remake of the first entry in this sub-series. In it, you play as Estelle and Joshua, two Bracers-in-training who travel around the world, helping people in order to earn full Bracer status. The main overarching storyline revolves around the mystery of what happened to Estelle’s father, who has gone missing. The game is known for its many characters and many lines of dialogue. It’s sort of a relaxed, slow moving, hang-out game that verges on visual novel territory at times. It’s great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of the PS1-style sprite-based graphics of the original, this remake features full 3D anime-style graphics that look basically like the Tales or Dragon Quest games. It looks pretty great, especially since the story of the original is so good. It will be nice to experience it with a more modern presentation. The original game is still available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>.</p><p id="more-preorder-guides"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="More preorder guides">Other Preorder Guides</h2></p><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster-nintendo-switch-2">Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-capcom-fighting-collection-2">Capcom Fighting Collection 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Ghost of Yotei Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-star-crossed-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-up-for-preorder">Kirby and the Forgotten Land Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-breath-wild-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-legend-zelda-tears-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-where-to-preorder">Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition-switch-2">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-super-mario-party-jamboree-jamboree-tv-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Party Jamboree + Jamboree TV Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

Not in real life, mind you, but in-game. And while it sounds like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s director is fishing for it, there hasn't been a bit on the line from Waffle House.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1922122520406458818" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, Tekken game director Katsuhiro Harada was responding to fans still eagerly asking for a Waffle House stage in Tekken 8. It's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-responds-to-the-many-fans-asking-for-a-waffle-house-level">a frequent demand</a> that's gained a lot of steam as Harada himself has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">expressed interest in learning more on the matter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Harada said he "fully understands" fans' requests. So much so, in fact, that he's already been thinking about it, and apparently taken action to try and make something happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Over the past year or more, I've actually tried to make contact through several different channels," said Harada on X/Twitter. "However, and this is purely my own speculation, I suspect that the lack of response may be due to the fact that the project I'm known for revolves around 'fighting-themed video games.'"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>To be honest, within the bounds of what I can say, I fully understand your (you guys) request—that's precisely why I had considered taking on this challenge.

It went on to become a Bethesda tradition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-players-show-off-its-physics-playground-by-playing-dominoes-with-books-and-sandwiches">that was continued with 2023’s Starfield and its more advanced physics</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, that tradition lives on, with one player spending seven hours lining up books to get the Dominoes chain reaction just right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1kl8pfa/someone_stole_my_video_and_uploaded_it_without/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor Muaxh03</a> uploaded the video below showing their work. We see the books slowly fall and knock the following book in a satisfying fashion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Muaxh03 said they did not use mods to place the books, rather placed them one by one, which sounds particularly grueling. They admit to spawning the books, however. The entire process took seven hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... almost every time I loaded the save something broke, it was not reliable so yes I had to deal with books falling or glitching most of the time, that's why you can see some desynchronizing on the books, some fall slower or faster,” Muaxh03 explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NPCs were disabled, of course: “I would lose my mind if there was NPCs walking around,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this effort is a good start for Oblivion Remastered Dominoes, previous efforts in past Bethesda games were more elaborate and involved varied objects. But playing around with books in Oblivion, even Oblivion Remastered, is a lot harder than you might think because you can’t rotate and place objects in Oblivion in the same way you can in Starfield or Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I spent the first 1-2 hours trying to learn how to place them good, after that the stairs took 2-3 hours because every time I tested it, it gave me different results, every time I loaded the save something broke,” Muaxh03 said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reaction from Oblivion players has been universally positive, with a mix of disbelief at the time, effort, and patience that went into placing the books so precisely in a game as fiddly as Oblivion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What next? “Cool now fill a bookcase!” joked one player. “I would sooner fight a god in hand-to-hand combat unarmed. Last time I tried to put a book back the whole room ended up in shambles — SHAMBLES!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Nicotero Leatherface Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gun Interactive says that it feels The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "has reached its full potential" and that it has been able to realize its future for the asymmetrical multiplayer game, allowing it to see its vision for this project toward its "natural" creative end.</p><p>"From the very beginning, we've always had a clear and concise vision for this game. We wanted to push the envelope on multiplayer asymmetrical horror, shed light on this iconic film to a newer generation, and place folks into the beautiful but macabre world of Muerto County and we feel we have achieved that," <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/tcsm-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio explained</a>.</p><p>As for the future, Gun Interactive hasn't revealed what its next project is, but it is urging fans to stay tuned.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/">One of several asymmetrical multiplayer games based on a horror movie IP</a>, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre stands apart from other games by utilizing a 4v3 structure for its gameplay, forcing survivors to keep an eye out for the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface and his homicidal family. An authentic recreation of the classic slasher movie--right down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-devs-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-recreate-leatherface-chainsaw/1100-6511374/" data-ref-id="1100-6511374">Leatherface's signature chainsaw</a>--the game was well-received at launch.</p><p>"As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>. While the game will still live on with the dedicated fans who regularly play it, the same can't be said for Evil Dead: The Game, as after a brief run, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-has-been-mysteriously-delisted-from-several-storefronts/1100-6531206/">it was pulled from digital storefronts</a> by publisher Boss Team Games.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">turned 20 last year</a>, and now one of its most viral moments, Leeroy Jenkins, has too.</p><p dir="ltr">The video, originally uploaded to the WoW forums but gaining more traction on May 11, 2005 when it was uploaded to <a href="https://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=1666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warcraftmovies.com</a>, shows a guild of WoW players in voice chat looking to conquer the Rookery room in the game's Upper Black Rock Spire raid. After going over an elaborate battle plan with a "32.33, repeating of course, percentage of survival," one AFK player, a paladin named Leeroy Jenkins, bolts up and shouts "Time's up, let's do this! Leeeeroyyyy Jenkinsssss!" He runs into the adjacent room and aggroes every dragonkin in sight. Chaos ensues and internet history is made.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mLyOj_QD4a4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins instantly became an internet icon and helped cement WoW in the public consciousness, his name becoming a call to arms for anyone who was about to do something with gusto without thinking about the consequences. The video has been watched tens of millions of times in the last two decades and became a viral sensation at a time when the modern internet as we know it was still in its infancy (YouTube, for example, was just a few months old at the time of the original video). An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HD reupload</a> of the video posted to YouTube in 2014 has racked up 26 million views alone.</p><p dir="ltr">That the whole video is staged is beside the point. The comedic writing and timing (and the absolutely absurd strategy of trying to clear out the Rookery room, rather than just avoiding the eggs entirely) was always too good to be true even before the folks behind the video openly admitted it.</p><p dir="ltr">But that is what makes the video so funny and also makes those early days of WoW so special. Here was a time before every raid strategy was known and when players hadn't quite min-maxed the fun out of encounters like this. Leeroy Jenkins blew up not because it was real, but because it was, despite its over-the-top nature, still believable as something that could happen if you joined a random UBRS group of well-meaning idiots. Such was the beauty of WoW's earliest days--something that developer Blizzard looked to recapture with its launch of WoW Classic in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">References to Leeroy Jenkins would go on to appear in everything from a Jeopardy! question to episodes of Family Guy and How I Met Your Mother. Blizzard has immortalized Leeroy Jenkins in a number of different ways too, including an official NPC who was added to the game during the Warlords of Draenor expansion and more recently played a role in WoW's in-game 20th anniversary event. He is also on various Hearthstone cards, and Blizzard even reward's WoW players with a special title, "Jenkins," for succeeding in UBRS where Leeroy and his group failed.</p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins continues to be an important reminder of what kind of hilarity can ensue when players don't take games too seriously and instead live in the moment. Even though his group failed miserably (on purpose), Leeroy's final words in the video still ring true today. Even in the face of ridicule and adversity, it's the fun we had along the way and the little things that matter. After all, at least he has chicken.</p>

		<p>Skydance Games has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a> has been delayed to 2026.</p>
<p>“We have an important update: Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will now be launching in early 2026,” the team wrote on a certain <a href="https://xcancel.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">social media hellscape</a>. “Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish, and make sure we give you the best possible experience, and one that lives up to our vision. We have some exciting things in store and look forward to sharing more soon!”</p>


<p>The Amy Hennig-led superhero game was announced back in March of last year, having originally been teased in 2021. Plaion had been partnered with as the game’s publisher, and 2025 was the stated launch target, but we’ve had nothing since the cinematic reveal trailer last summer. We could get a gameplay reveal this summer, but it did feel like details were thin on the ground for a game expected this year.</p>
<p>Obviously it’s much better to take your time, get things right and try to release the best game possible… but depending on how big of a delay this ends up being, Skydance do risk slipping back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">that GTA 6 window</a>, which itself has just been delayed to May 2026.</p>
<p>Taking the superhero fight back to World War 2,&nbsp;Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra will have four playable characters with the perspectives switching between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones. This will give different gameplay aspects too, with Nanali likely having much more sneaking and spying compared to the other characters.</p>

<p>The cast for the game will be Khary Payton as Azzuri, T’Challa’s grandfather and the Black Panther in this game’s timeline, Drew Moerlein taking on the role of Steve Rogers/Captain America, Megalyn Echikunwoke portraying Nanali, a Wakandan spy, Marque Richardson lending his voice to Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, Lyne Renée voicing Julie, a member of the French Resistance, and Howard Stark, Tony Stark’s father, is being voiced by Joel Johnstone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-to-lay-off-3-of-its-total-employees.1188201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is about to lay off thousands of employees across all of its divisions, a new report released today claims.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CNBC</a>&nbsp;(which cites a statement given to it directly by Microsoft), 3% of all employees will be laid off "across all levels, teams, and geographies". That's CNBC's wording.</p>

<p>As CNBC points out, Microsoft counted 228,000 employees on its books as of June last year. That would mean that roughly 6,800 employees will be losing their jobs in the largest round of company cuts <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-gaming-employees-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs-at-microsoft" rel="nofollow">since January 2023</a>, when around 10,000 staff members were laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=AdIDYF6M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=08Y7Teu9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of Microsoft's divisions, including Xbox, will presumably be affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement as loaded with corpo-speak as you'd expect, a spokesperson told CNBC that the layoffs are part of "organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>These cuts aren't related to performance, according to Microsoft; instead, they're about reducing "layers of management", as CNBC puts it.</p>

<p>Despite Microsoft wanting to "best position" itself for "success", it seems the company is already achieving that success. Back in April, the company celebrated a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">buoyant third quarter</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, with revenue up 13% year-on-year and operating income up 16%.</p>

<p>Xbox's "content and services revenue" was up 8% in that same period, so whatever Microsoft's motivation is for laying off thousands of its employees, it can't be to turn around struggling fortunes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=uRU3z3jE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-fable-microsoft.jpg?itok=bzJM5mfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft's upcoming Xbox slate includes&nbsp;<em>Fable</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come just a couple of weeks after EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">announced sweeping cuts</a> to its own workforce, with&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> among the EA subsidiaries most affected by the layoffs. Other studios hit by cuts in recent months include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a> and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft again</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the staggering number of employees the tech giant has laid off in recent times didn't stop CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> in 2024. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>

<p>In gaming terms, Microsoft's Xbox division is gearing up (no pun intended) to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">release&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>later this year, and upcoming major titles include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-e-day-people-can-fly" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: E-Day</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Fable</em></a>, although neither has a release date as of yet.</p>

As the name implies, the new SteamOS Compatibility system will rate how compatible games are with third-party devices, similar to how Valve already rates the compatibility of games for its own Steam Deck.</p><p>The new rating will only show up on devices running SteamOS that aren’t a Steam Deck and are designed to quickly indicate to users if all of a game’s features and functionality, including any anti-cheat tools it may be using, are fully supported by the OS. Games will be marked as either “SteamOS Compatible” or “SteamOS Unsupported” in the Steam Store and Steam Client.</p><p>The rating “does not include testing results for performance and input, since we will not know (and have not tested) how all titles will run on all potential hardware,” as Valve points out in an announcement shared to its community pages yesterday. But the company expects “over 18,000 titles on Steam to be marked SteamOS compatible out of the gate.”</p><p>Because the new ratings are “automatically generated from Steam Deck verification results without additional testing,” Valve says that developers don’t need to take any additional steps to ensure their games are compatible with third-party SteamOS devices. “If your title already has a Steam Deck Compatibility rating, an automated process will use that data to give it a SteamOS Compatibility rating.”</p><div><p>The Legion Go S will be the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">first handheld gaming PC to trade Windows for SteamOS</a>, the gaming-focused operating system that powers Valve’s Steam Deck.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Anyone that's played a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Souls</a> game knows how it tells its stories. You meet a wide range of characters, all of which mostly just talk at you in varyingly cryptic ways. There's also tiny bits of lore offered up from weapons and items too, all of which build up a messy picture. But in something like the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, where the main focus is gameplay that encourages you to constantly be on the move, I've been left wondering how its story will play out. As it turns out, it's quite different from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-taking-a-unique-approach-to-storytelling-ign-first">IGN</a>, game director Junya Ishizaki set the scene a little bit explaining that "Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak. So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention - it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen the lands between and it needed some sort of opposition."
</p>
<p>
That opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, the preset characters you play as. As opposed to Elden Ring, where there is a main plot so to seek, you'll mostly be trying to learn about the Nightfarers' respective pasts through Remembrances.
</p>
<p>
In Nightreign's version of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-how-to-get-to-roundtable-hold">Roundtable Hold</a>, you can check out the character you play as' Remembrances through a journal. Sometimes these are just logs, other times you'll be taken to specific areas to live out memories. Once you've spoken with an NPC within a Remembrance, you then get a task to complete. These vary from character to character, like how Wylder might need to go find a particular item in a cave, or how Raider has to win 1v1 boss fights.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I'll have to wait and see how I feel about this structure when actually playing the game. I'm confident all the Nightfarers' backstories will have that classic FromSoft appealing vagueness, I just worry that they'll just feel a bit tacked on rather than properly woven in. Happy to be proven wrong, I do like the sound of each character needing to do different things, so I'll cross my fingers that it works out.

            <p>
Mark Barlet, founder of high-profile gaming accessibility charity AbleGamers, has been accused of fostering abuse at the non-profit for more than two decades. 
</p>
<p>
In a wide-ranging report published today by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors">IGN</a>, former colleagues claim Barlet used sexist, racist and misogynistic language in the workplace, including about other employees, and made comments offensive to other disabled people.
</p>
<p>
One source claimed Barlet repeatedly referred to her as the company's HR representative, as she was the only woman in the business. The source claimed Barlet would then also make offensive remarks regarding her breasts in front of colleagues.
</p>
<p>
Barlet, who left the charity last September following an investigation by an external law firm, denies all claims of abuse and harassment. 
</p>
<p>
"After thoroughly being investigated by an independent third-party, it was determined that none of that was true," Barlet said in a statement.
</p>
<p>
Other claims involve wasteful spending of the charity's funds by Barlet, involving first class air travel and extended hotel stays following business trips, and an expensive office charger for his Tesla.
</p>
<p>
In response, Barlet said his travel was justified by company policies, his extended trips were to cover additional business meetings, and his Tesla charger was just a "plug".
</p>
<p>
Regardless, it's claimed that an April 2024 investigation by  external payroll and HR firm ADP advised AbleGamers' board to part ways with Barlet, after concerns over his spending. 
</p>
<p>
This advice was reportedly ignored, prompting multiple employees to file Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaints, prompting the latter invesigation that did then result in Barlet leaving the charity in September 2024 - albeit reportedly with a severance package. 
</p>
<p>
Since his departure, Barlet has started a new accessibility firm, AccessForge, while employees who spoke out about him claim they were subsequently forced out of AbleGamers by its board in retaliation.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, employees still at AbleGamers claim they have been repeatedly dissuaded from sharing their experiences for IGN's report. It's alleged that the charity's Steven Spohn has told staff not to speak out, for fear of "ruining the charity's reputation".
</p>
<p>
Neither Spohn or AbleGamers responded to IGN's requests for comment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hag-capisco-office-chair-ergonomic-review-sit-weird<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It is an understatement to say that I have gained a reputation as a “chair guy” on account of the fact that I have <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found multiple Herman Miller chairs on the streets of New York City</a>. The Aeron is not my favorite chair, though she is indisputably an icon. My favorite chair is the weirdest one of all: the HÅG Capisco 8106, an ergonomic little freak chair designed for people who just can’t sit in one place.</p><p>The HÅG Capisco looks bizarre. Unsurprisingly, it was designed by a Norwegian industrial designer, Peter Opsvik, who also designed several chairs for children, kneeling chairs, and a lounge chair named “<a href="https://www.opsvik.no/works/industrial-design/garden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garden</a>” that looks like a tree with a bunch of orbs (AKA <a href="https://star-trek.design/seating/globe-garden-chair-by-peter-opsvik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the chair Worf uses</a>) I have often described the Capisco as “the art Delia Deetz makes in <em>Beetlejuice </em>but you sit on it.” Joe Rogan uses them in his studio, which is a bizarre reputation for this chair, but this is one of those rare instances where I agree with Rogan (along with his love of submission grappling and doing a lot of psychedelics).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Joe Rogan Raves About the HAG Capisco Chair – Find Out Why It's a Game Changer!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiwvBLp0OfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Unlike a traditional chair where you just sit in normally, the Capisco is meant to account for multiple seating positions. Some other, “normal” office chairs have elements of this flexibility. For example, the <a href="https://www.knoll.com/shop/en_us/home-office-ergonomic-work-chairs/generation-chair-by-knoll/1093.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knoll Generation</a> (which I once salvaged half a dumpster's worth of in midtown thanks to a reader tip) has a flexible back that allows the user lean on the top while side-sitting. But the cross-shaped back of the Capisco allows you to sit in ways impossible in other seating: forwards-facing, sideways, perched up high, and backwards with the seat back pressed against your chest – the “let me rap with you” position, or Riker maneuver as it is often called. (This chair has, in fact, <a href="https://star-trek.design/seating/capisco-chair-by-peter-opsvik-for-hag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been featured on <em>Star Trek</em></a> multiple times as well as <a href="https://focus.flokk.com/the-design-history-of-the-h%C3%A5g-capisco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Expanse</em></a>.) You can actually combine the backwards position with the lockable tilt mechanism, allowing you to face your desk leaning forward like you’re driving a Kawasaki motorcycle. This is appropriate, because Peter Opsvik based his design of the chair on <a href="https://www.opsvik.no/works/industrial-design/hag-capisco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the posture of horseback riding</a>, a dynamic and constantly shifting saddle that meets the rider as weight distribution changes.</p><figure><figcaption>$150 on Facebook marketplace well spent. Just needs new seat foam. </figcaption></figure><p>I own two Capiscos. The best-known model is the HÅG Capisco 8106, but my first was a “Puls” model I got cheap on Craigslist from a startup guy in Tribeca who got it with a Covid stipend and said his “wife hates it.” The Puls is a budget friendly version that swaps much of the fabric back out for rigid, injection-molded plastic. This is far more useful if you are in a medical environment or someplace where you may easily stain the fabric, but some people may just enjoy the feeling of rigid plastic on their skin. I do not, and for that reason the chair is now on semi-permanent loan to my local hacking space. But the Puls gave me a taste for the real thing. and I have been quietly searching <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-marketplace-is-not-fun-to-use" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook Marketplace</a> for an 8106 ever since. This week, I found someone who had one sitting in storage and on a severe discount because it needs replacement foam on the seat. After a long and complex ride via public transit (it was raining and no cabs were available), my baby was home.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The top of the legs features flat, ridged surfaces that are perfect for perching.</figcaption></figure><p>There was a time several years ago when everyone was praising standing desks, which resulted in a boom in their production. The idea is that it is not natural for a person to be sitting for extended periods of time, and even the nicest chair is going to do a number on your back. The other advantage is that even if you don’t use a standing desk for its stated purpose, it’s still an affordable desk that’s easy to adjust the height of. With my Aeron I do not use my standing desk to its potential, but the HÅG Capisco positively sings with it. I find myself adjusting both my standing desk and Capisco multiple times to rapidly change to a more stable sitting position. It is also possibly the only chair that consistently gets my arms into an ergonomic typing position with my equally <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freakish split keyboard</a> from both a forward and backward seating position. That said, lest I besmirch the Aeron too much, I like having it in my office as well for when I need to just sit normally for like 20 seconds.</p><p>While the Capisco is designed with flexibility in mind, it is also far better at suggesting that the user gets into an ergonomic frame of mind. Sat in the most traditional way possible, the seat forces your hips into a wider stance, while the sides of the cushion roll off gently, relieving pressure on the bottom of the thighs (to me, the Aeron’s biggest Achilles heel). The cushioned but semi-rigid nature of the backrest makes it difficult to slouch, and the arm rests being behind the back lead the user to organically adopt a position with good posture. For example, if you use the arm rests in the forward position during a typing break, the elbows tend to fall to the side or even behind the user, forcing the elbows to pinch together, thus ensuring ideal posture. If you have ever seen a person lean on the edge of a Jacuzzi, imagine that arm position but lower.</p><figure><figcaption>The various forms of the Capisco: the Puls, the 8106, the headrest variant, and converted to a stool. Credit Flokk. </figcaption></figure><p>But the Capisco also allows for potentially freakish ways of sitting. You can perch on the edge, basically using it to half sit and half stand. It is a chair that is meant to be fidgeted in, leaned on, and very importantly perched on. The legs of the chair feature ridged surfaces which are perfect for putting your feet up on, thus removing the need for a foot rest, although they do offer a comical one that snaps into the base called the StepUp, as well as a headrest, which looks <a href="https://www.rethinking-ergonomics.com/product/hag-capisco-headrest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bizarre even compared to the chair</a>. A good friend of mine, who snagged two Capiscos relatively cheap when a startup went bust, has the model with foot rings which he loves for this specific purpose.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hag Capisco (with Hag Stepup) Ergonomic Office Chair with Sit Stand Desk" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5r0Lun5HbrU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The HÅG Capisco 8106 fares better than many chairs in terms of basic repairability. The back rest is attached to the base with a single hex bolt, which allows the chair to be converted to a stool in under a minute. I have taken apart many office chairs with complex mechanisms, and the Capisco is surprisingly straightforward despite its strange appearance. If it has a weakness it is that, like all cushion-based chairs, the seat foam will eventually deteriorate and the fabric may need to be refreshed or cleaned. Like most seat parts, replacement foam can be bought from your local distributor. When it comes to the fabric, a surface cleaning will suffice most of the time. But for removal, while the upholstery on the backrest upholstery has zippers that allow it to be removed easily, the mechanism for the seat fabric is more elaborate and annoying to remove. If I had to change anything, making that easier would be on the top of my list. That said, these are relatively minor complaints for an otherwise simple, easy to service chair.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How to change the seat upholstery | HÅG Capisco | Flokk Repair Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbIwQcz9B9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While the Capisco is not a chair I would recommend to everyone, I find that people who sit on one tend to like it more often than not. It is an office chair that exists outside of tier lists because it’s off in space doing its own thing. I can imagine a well-meaning but oblivious Hank Scorpio-style CEO buying a fleet of these in the startup boom only to have a few of his employees resent him and bring in folding chairs after a month. But for a certain kind of person, there is no better chair for sitting, or leaning, or perching like a freaky gremlin. I have heard from a friend it is fantastic for shorter people (*cough* Joe Rogan *cough*). This is a chair for vigorously Scandinavian people and L from <em>Death Note</em>. Though you technically are sitting in a Capisco, it is functionally so anti-chair that I hesitate to call it “sitting.” Welcome to “Sitting 2.”&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/giant-bomb-sold-new-owners-jeff-fandom"><h3>Giant Bomb Has Been Sold To Giant Bomb</h3></a><p>'Giant Bomb has new owners, and you're looking at them'</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/nintendo-switch-2-features-a-pin-code-lock-battery-saver-mode-a-mouseable-home-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Nintendo Today app has revealed more of the small features that are featured in the Nintendo Switch 2, little technical quality of life tweaks that will hopefully make the system a better one for the long haul.</p>
<p>For those keen to keep their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> private, a PIN code lock will be available within the regular system settings, so you can set a code and keep pesky siblings, children, spouses and public transport thieves locked out from&nbsp;<em>your</em> games – obviously the last one would suck so much more if it happened to you than other people in your life just messing with your games.</p>


<p>The original Nintendo Switch also had a PIN code lock feature, though this was <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Change-the-Parental-Controls-PIN-1494765.html">tied in with the parental controls</a>, and much less obvious for most users.</p>
<p>Another good feature for those who fuss and fret over battery capacity of their precious smart phones and laptops is the battery saver mode, which lets you tell the Nintendo Switch 2 to stop charging at 90%. This is good for those who tend to keep their consoles docked and rarely play handheld, where having a battery-powered device constantly connected and at 100% can negatively impact capacity – the data on this is a bit fuzzy for if it will help in day-to-day handheld use, though.</p>

<p>And finally, with the Joy-Con 2 able to switch into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">mouse mode</a> at the twist of a wrist, the Switch 2 Home screen and all the system settings and menus can be navigated with a mouse pointer. A small thing, but kinda neat?</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is just a few weeks away from release on 5th June 2025, coming alongside Mario Kart World, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-would-you-buy-that-for-a-tenner/">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">a pair of Zelda Switch 2 Edition titles</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/all-the-confirmed-nintendo-switch-2-launch-titles/">a plethora of old, new and enhanced third party games</a>, such as Cyberpunk 2077, Civilization 7 and more. Of course, you also have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">a huge back catalogue of compatible Nintendo Switch titles</a> that you can still dive back into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Codemasters and EA Sports have unveiled several details of their upcoming racing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a>. The most interesting one for our readers is undoubtedly the detailed list of PC requirements, with recommendations for every target, including Virtual Reality, 8K resolution, or path tracing.</p>
<p>According to the developers, F1 25 will require a GeForce RTX 5080 or AMD RX 7900 XTX graphics card to play at 1080p resolution and 60 frames per second with upscalers (presumably NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, respectively) set to Quality. Weirdly enough, while the 8K spec does recommend using Frame Generation, the path tracing spec does not. Perhaps, with Frame Generation enabled, the recommended spec can actually reach 4K@60 frames per second.</p>

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/soulframe">Soulframe</a> has the bones of a great action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>," I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soulframe-has-the-bones-of-a-great-action-rpg-but-im-enjoying-it-partly-because-it-feels-too-late-to-enjoy-warframe#comments">wrote last November</a>. Developers Digital Extremes continue to graft flesh to those bones, plumping the world-building's marrow and cranking the sinews of the combat. The game's Preludes edition - a sort of relentlessly expanding limited-access beta - <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/patch-notes/0-9-0">continues to be updated</a> with new weapons, faction features, player Pacts (classes, essentially), areas, and enemies. They've also made some revisions, which include turning the Idol system into a distinct set of weapons so as to give it "a more focused purpose in your arsenal".</p> <!--more-->
<p>Despite promising myself that I would try to keep up with Soulframe's development, after flopping out of the FOMO boat with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a>, I managed to overlook the original edition of the Idol system. Digital Extremes have certainly been busy, and more is in the offing: the 10th Preludes update, due this month, will further expand upon the new Motes and Runes upgrades system while adding some throwable secondary weapons and a wizard's staff with respectable Dragon's Dogma energy.</p>
<p>Here's a trailer to show off the Preludes build as it currently stands, plus a few of the aforementioned new trinkets.</p>
<figure>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mLydrgmH4g" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>So how do Motes (which already exist to some extent in-game) work as upgrades? As detailed at <a href="https://www.soulframe.com/en/news/soulframe-at-pax-east-2025">PAX East</a>, they're tiny Ghibli-ass critters you'll find around the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. Once caught, they can be ordered to take up possession inside a weapon to provide a new ability - freezing enemies solid, for example.</p>
<p>You can also release them if you have a duplicate Mote to acquire feeding materials for your remaining Motes, strengthening them. Or, you can have your weapon's Mote feast on the soul of an enemy. In the dev stream, Digital Extremes jocularly observe that none of this is anything like Pokemon. They've clearly been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-newest-patch-stops-you-from-gliding-with-your-pals-and-yes-it-is-because-of-nintendos-lawsuit">keeping up with current events</a>.</p>
<p>Runes, meanwhile, are modifiers for Motes, placed in sockets on your inventory. They grant boons such as more staggering power after you nail a perfect dodge. There are 20 new Motes coming in Preludes 10, and the hope is to let players start properly build-crafting in a simulation that has hitherto been more about levelling up and acquiring more potent gear.</p>
<p>Upcoming new enemies, meanwhile, include a boss, the Tired King, whom the devs liken to the Ringwraiths in LOTR. He doesn't seem tired so much as great at delegation, summoning minions to attack you. They're also working on the second Soulframe in-game event, the Festival of the Circade. Where the first was Halloween-flavoured, this one takes inspiration from recent house-wrangling doozie <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> with a new puzzle location, the Crypt of Circade.</p>
<p>All these bits and pieces notwithstanding, I still find Soulframe appealing for approximately the same reasons I did in 2024. It casts you as a lonely roving paladin in a realm of enchanted animals that is being steadily ruined by pollutant-spewing oiks in metal hats. It blends sword and sorcery into a graceful procession of combos, parries, buffs, projectiles and finishers. I wouldn't say the combat is very difficult or complex but it has fluidity and charisma. I enjoy inhabiting a body that can do stuff like this.</p>
<p>The dungeon ambience is fairly absorbing as procgen creations go, and the lore writing has a gnarled, fey intensity that sometimes comes across as garnish for a nothingburger, but is often quite fun. The weapon and equipment art is as handsome as you'd find in Warframe, but not as 'extra', you know? A little easier to behold without developing a migraine. Forgive me, Warframers - I am old, and brighter colours upset me. I like my tapestries faded, my armour dusty and my blades notched and blunted... but not broken.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There will soon be a new compatibility rating on Steam store pages for games. Valve has announced that SteamOS hardware other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a> will get its own checkmark, meaning the title will work with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve went over what this new rating will mean <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">on Steam</a>, adding that roughly 18,000 games should be compatible with SteamOS from the jump. "SteamOS compatibility ratings are based on a subset of the Steam Deck compatibility testing results and are meant to show at a glance whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," the announcement post reads. "This includes features like game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support."</p><p dir="ltr">From the developer side of things, Valve is saying that it doesn't need to do any extra work to ensure SteamOS compatibility for its games. The verification can happen automatically apparently based on the Steam Deck verification process. Additionally, Valve is promising that "SteamOS compatibility results will all be the same or higher than Steam Deck verified results."</p><p dir="ltr">So far, the only other SteamOS device is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">the Legion Go S handheld</a>. However, it's clear that Valve envisions this segment "expanding to more devices in the future." Meanwhile, Microsoft is reportedly teaming up with Asus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-photos-leak-as-xbox-app-gets-handheld-friendly-update/1100-6531368/" data-ref-id="1100-6531368">an Xbox-branded ROG Ally 2, which leaked</a> last week.</p>
