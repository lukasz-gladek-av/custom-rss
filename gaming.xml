I think that with a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, you'd be well within your right to have an eyebrow pre-raised considering its online, sort of free-to-play (depending on where you live) predecessor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-desert-online">Black Desert Online</a> regarding the like of microtransactions. I know I certainly have! At a glance Crimson Desert certainly looks like it could fall into similar pitfalls if only based on vibes alone. However! Developer Pearl Abyss would quite like you to know that, in that regard at least, you have nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4">Dropped Frames show</a> (ta, <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217">Okami13_</a>), marketing director at Pearly Abyss America Will Powers explained, "I can say that definitively: there is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions. It’s a monetisation model. If you do free-to-play then you need to make up the revenue in a different way. This is a premium experience. That is the transaction. Full stop."
</p>
<p>
This is, admittedly, an annoying thing to have to be thankful for. I sure would like it if games weren't designed to exploit the most exploitable of us! Still, it's something, even if this doesn't totally rule out other bits of, admittedly still annoying but slightly less so, DLC, expansions and the like.
</p>
<p>
Last month, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game got a bit more of a lengthier look-in which quite honestly befuddled me at points. It's obviously very much a medieval fantasy setting, but it's just so realistic looking that the flashy particle effects, literal mechs, and just straight up dragons feel like they don't contrast as well as they potentially might in a more stylised setting. Ah well, at least you only have to pay for it all once!

              <p><span>According to Rémi Verschelde, project manager of Godot Engine and co-founder of the platform’s financial backer W4 Games, the never-ending wave of “AI slop” pull requests on Godot’s GitHub is becoming “increasingly draining and demoralizing” for its maintainers, to the point that over 4,600 pull requests are currently open on the engine’s GitHub page.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/godot-co-founder-says-ai-slop-pull-requests-have-become-overwhelming"><i><span>Game Developer</span></i></a><span>, Verschelde’s comment on Bluesky was made in response to a post by Adriaan de Jongh, the developer and publisher of the 2017 indie puzzle hit </span><i><span>Hidden Folks</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriaan.games/post/3mexoxyaui22x"><span>which stated</span></a><span> that Godot’s GitHub has been overrun with countless undisclosed AI-generated pull requests. “Changes often make no sense, descriptions are extremely verbose, users don’t understand their own changes…It’s a total shitshow.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/app.bsky.feed.post/3meyerixvhs2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreifnwjboai3ml34oyyl7f2o3d7dtktxqmqrbt5hepzzs4xebfw2qea"> <p lang="en">Honestly, AI slop PRs are becoming increasingly draining and demoralizing for #Godot maintainers.</p> <p>If you want to help, more funding so we can pay more maintainers to deal with the slop (on top of everything we do already) is the only viable solution I can think of:</p> <p>fund.godotengine.org</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz?ref_src=embed">Rémi Verschelde (@akien.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:v6vo5mafc2uirknvv5jegtzz/post/3meyerixvhs2p?ref_src=embed">2026-02-16T15:33:57.699Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyerixvhs2p"><span>In reply</span></a><span>, Verschelde noted that the problem has become such an issue that Godot’s GitHub maintainers are being forced to “second guess every [pull request] from new contributors, multiple times per day.” Although he stated that Godot prides itself on “being welcoming to new contributors,” Verschelde also doesn’t see a way out of the situation, beyond further donations to help pay more maintainers. “Maintainers spend a lot of time assisting new contributors to help them get PRs in a mergeable state. I don’t know how long we can keep it up.”</span></p>

 <p><span>A cursory glance at the </span><a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed"><span>closed pull requests</span></a><span> on Godot’s GitHub page proves that this isn’t an exaggeration, as dozens of pull requests have been denied or reported as spam by Godot’s maintainers within the past month alone, with comments left by maintainers pointing out AI-written code appearing on a daily basis. Godot has been used to ship a bunch of hit indie games over the last few years like <em>Brotato</em> and <em>Until Then</em> and is a valuable alternative to proprietary game engines like Unity, which have been <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-promises-deluge-of-new-games-prompted-into-existence-by-ai-as-its-stock-tanks-2000669483">rolling out their own genAI tools</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Verschelde stated that paying more maintainers would be the simplest option, he also stated that Godot may have to raise “the barrier to entry” for its contributors instead. When quizzed about the possibility of automating the process, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/akien.bsky.social/post/3meyf4t77ds2p"><span>he replied</span></a><span> that it “seems horribly ironic to have to run an AI on our CI to detect AI slop.” </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chetsucks.com/post/3mextjgn2g22i"><span>Chet Faliszek</span></a><span>, writer for several Valve titles including </span><i><span>Left 4 Dead</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Portal 2</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Half-Life 2: Episode One</span></i><span>, believes that the onus to fix the system should be on GitHub instead. “Really is just exhausting to watch all this playout and github promoting this, not fighting it.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Disney and Lucasfilm released the latest trailer for <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, the first new <em>Star Wars</em> movie since <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> hit theaters back in 2019, and it includes everything I want from a movie set in this famous galaxy: eierd aliens, sci-fi action, deep cut references, and a voice cameo from famed director Martin Scorsese.</p> <p>The upcoming <em>Star Wars</em> flick stars Pedro Pascal as fan-favorite bounty hunter Din Djarin alongside his faithful little buddy Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. Set after the events of the original trilogy and the <em>Mandalorian</em> TV series, this new movie, which hits theaters on May 22, is set to tie up plot threads involving the remnants of the Empire trying to destroy the New Republic. It will also likely provide more answers about Grogu, a member of Yoda’s species. Here’s the trailer:</p>

   <p>And yes, that shopkeeper alien we see at the start who gets spooked when asked to provide information about a Hutt is voiced by the one and only Martin Scorsese, the director behind films like <em>Goodfellas</em> and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/martin-scorsese-joinins-star-wars-universe/">Disney confirmed as much with <em>Polygon</em></a>. I can’t wait to see how angry online commenters who can’t stop yelling about the famous director’s MCU comments will react to him appearing in what looks to be a big, dumb, super-expensive <em>Star Wars</em> summer blockbuster.</p> <p>As for the rest of the trailer, I’m super into all the weird, goofy aliens and monsters that appear in it. The fact that a <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mantellian_Savrip">Mantellian Savrip</a> shows up at the very end of the trailer as the big monster alien Mando and Grogu fight in the city made me giggle a little, I have to admit. This is an alien that first appeared as one of the holochess pieces in the very first <em>Star Wars</em> movie. Cool to see it here in the flesh. <a href="https://x.com/sw_holocron/status/2023761695026577621">Meanwhile, seeing Embo</a>, a bounty hunter from the<em> Clone Wars</em> animated series, pop up was fun, as was seeing Zeb from <em>Rebels</em> show up again after first appearing in live action back in the original <em>Mando</em> show on Disney+.</p>

 <p>Will all these silly cameos and references be enough in and of themselves to make<em> Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> a good movie? Nope. But at least this thing seems like a big movie, and I’m happy about that. <em>Star Wars</em> belongs in theaters, even when it’s bad, and I’m happy that after a few years away, we are finally getting a new cinematic <em>Star Wars</em> adventure. Let’s just hope it’s halfway decent when it arrives in May.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-game-length/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length could stop you from buying the game—don’t lie, it’s because you’re too scared. If you are legitimately concerned about how long Capcom’s latest entry is, this guide should provide clarity.</p>



<p>Previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> games have always had a decent length to them, with some being way longer than others. The RE speedruns are legendary, with players mopping up the main story in one brief sitting. If this is putting you off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, let’s take a look at what you can expect.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-resident-evil-requiem">How Many Hours To Beat Resident Evil Requiem?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Say Grace. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There have been conflicting reports about Resident Evil Requiem’s game length, but based on sources, you should expect around 10-16 hours of main-game content, with completionist save files expected to clock in around 30-40 hours.</strong></p>



<p>Reports have been circling about the game’s length, but truth be told, no one has an <em>exact </em>bearing on Requiem’s game length yet.</p>



<p>Three voices have managed to give a ballpark region for the game’s runtime: The director, the producer, and long-time leaker Dusk Golem.</p>



<p>Initially, it was suggested by the game’s producer that Requiem would be comparable to Resident Evil 4 in terms of game length. Everyone’s mileage varies, but the fourth main game is up there with one of the longest runtimes for main content. It’s amazing how much extra time is added for having crazy chainsaw people cut Leon’s head off.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-director-explains-leons-ruthless-anger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Director Talks Leon’s ‘Ruthless Anger’</a></li>
</ul>



<p>This gave everyone hope that Resident Evil 9 would also be a meaty adventure. Since then, the game’s director has come out and said the horror title’s length is hard to gauge. Finally, Dusk Golem—who provided details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-review-embargo-date/" id="177337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem’s review embargo date</a>—gave information on what they knew:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve heard myself it’s longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Village’s game length (particularly for a first-time playthrough) is around the 10-hour mark. So, even if Requiem finds a healthy middle ground, the first playthrough should be around 12-14 hours, with a wider margin of 10-16 hours capturing everything—not too shabby.</p>



<p>Obviously, the details are more hit and miss than the original Resident Evil’s dialogue. The expected game length mark shouldn’t be too far short if it is.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(2/3)-The producer claims the game is "roughly" the length of RE:4, though the director stepped in to say that estimating game time is hard, so to just expect a "Resident Evil" amount of content.<br>-Separately, I've heard myself it's longer than Village, but a bit shorter than RE:4</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2020691307052859637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<h2 id="h-how-does-resident-evil-9-compare-to-other-resident-evil-games">How Does Resident Evil 9 Compare To Other Resident Evil Games?</h2>



<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem’s game length sounds like it’s more in keeping with recent Resident Evil games, rather than the earlier entries, which were very short in comparison.</strong></p>



<p>You get indie horror games nowadays that are longer than the original Resident Evil trilogy entries! Resi 4 really advanced the series and gave players a long and winding adventure. It’s been fairly consistent ever since.</p>

</ul>



<p>According to <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HowLongToBeat</a> (which aggregates playthrough from hundreds and thousands of players), here’s the average playtime for every mainline Resident Evil game—and we’re using the remakes where applicable.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is bringing plenty of changes to the popular Universe Mode.</p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the wide variety of changes coming to Universe Mode. The name of the game is control in WWE 2K26, and this year’s Universe Mode provides even more options for players to meticulously manipulate the in-game sandbox while also allowing for set-it-and-forget-it options for those who just want to kick back and watch a simulated Universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-you-re-a-wizard-wwe">You’re a Wizard, WWE</h2>



<p>This year’s WWE Universe Mode features a new Universe Wizard that lets players choose which weekly shows and PLEs to feature, assign Superstars to each show and their champions, and set the calendar start month. Players can choose an existing show, such as WWE Monday Night Raw. However, they can also either import a show they downloaded or start from scratch with a brand-new creation.</p>



<p>Players can edit details for default shows like Raw and SmackDown, including rosters, championships, and divisions. Each show supports up to eight titles across men’s and women’s divisions, including tag team and intergender titles, plus two Money in the Bank briefcases.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-more-customization-options-in-universe-mode-for-wwe-2k26">More Customization Options in Universe Mode for WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 expands Universe mode with new match setup options, including enhanced settings and sliders. Players can now adjust matchmaking sliders to fine-tune match card sorting, scoring, and bonuses for title matches, rivalries, and match types. </p>



<p>For those who want to start from scratch, there are settings to remove all default rivalry options and start with a blank canvas.</p>











<p>Promo options are also updated. This year, players have even more control over the outcome of Universe Mode promos. When challenging a rival to a match, the challenger can now directly select the match stipulations. Players can take the direction of their promos in new avenues, including babyface and heel turns.</p>



<p>There are also customization options for wrestlers’ attire for weekly shows, pay-per-view events, and WrestleMania. Once again, allowing even more customization options.</p>

Kennedy in Capcom's hugely anticipated game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem has been pitched by Capcom as a special title in the series — one that returns to the franchise's origins to wrap up long-standing plotlines and feature fan-favorite characters — such as Leon, of course, but also what appears to be Sherry — as part of a much-anticipated return to Raccoon City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the franchise celebrates its 30th anniversary, Resident Evil Requiem is believed by some fans to likely be the final time we see or play as some of these characters, as Capcom moves its franchise forward. (Also, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/women-in-particular-were-pretty-strict-when-reviewing-his-design-resident-evil-requiem-director-says-hot-uncle-leon-s-kennedy-has-many-fans-at-capcom">hot uncle Leon</a> is one thing, but hot grandad Leon seems less believable.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which is to say that there's a particular level of concern around Resident Evil Requiem plot leaks — with some fans now saying they will be avoiding social media fully for the foreseeable future. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early," wrote noted Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dusk Golem</a>, who repeatedly stated that Leon was in the game months before Capcom made it official. "Funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brace yourselves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The account then shared a link to an image of a boxed PlayStation 5 copy of Resident Evil Requiem, seemingly out in the wild. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">I can personally verify there is at least one person out there who bought Resident Evil Requiem from a store selling early, funnily enough someone I vaguely know &amp; have talked to a few times, no spoilers out there yet but brave yourselves.<a href="https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xoDURKOWVw</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2023701578654642421?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As ever, the best advice to avoid spoilers is simply to avoid the internet as much as you can before next week, but particularly to be careful of YouTube and Twitch comments where people spread spoilers in chat.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/valves-steam-deck-intermittently-out-of-stock-as-ram-shortage-drags-on/</link>
            <guid>1438474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this month, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/ram-shortage-delays-valves-steam-machine-desktop-and-steam-frame-headset/">announced</a> it was delaying the release of its new Steam Machine desktop and Steam Frame VR headset due to memory and storage shortages that have been cascading across the PC industry since late 2025. But those shortages are also coming for products that have already launched.</p>
<p>Valve had added a note to its Steam Deck page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">noting</a> that the device would be “out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages.” None of Valve’s three listed Steam Deck configurations are currently available to buy, nor are any of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/steamdeckrefurbished">certified refurbished Steam Deck configurations</a> that Valve sometimes offers.</p>
<p>Valve hasn’t announced any price increases for the Deck, at least not yet—the 512GB OLED model is still listed at $549 and the 1TB version at $649. But the basic 256GB LCD model has been formally discontinued now that it has sold out, increasing the Deck’s de facto starting price from $399 to $549. Valve <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344310/valve-discontinues-steam-deck-lcd-oled-versions-remain#g344310-2">announced in December</a> that it was ending production on the LCD version of the Deck and that it wouldn’t be restocked once it sold out.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck’s hardware is four years old this month, and faster hardware with better chips and higher-resolution screens have been released in the years since. But those Ryzen Z1 and Z2 chips aren’t always dramatically faster than the Deck’s semi-custom AMD chip; many of those handhelds are also considerably more expensive than the OLED Deck’s $549 starting price. When it’s in stock, the Deck still offers compelling performance and specs for the price.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/</link>
            <guid>1438459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, is out on PS5 and PC in a little more than two weeks' time from the time of this writing. Despite it having a rough road to launch, now that we're so close to it, the game looks more impressive than ever, and its new 'Death Awaits' trailer ahead of its <strong>open preview server slam test</strong> next weekend is the latest example of just how solid it looks.</p>



<p>The server slam test will give Bungie the chance to let the servers get pushed to their limit right ahead of launch, as the test will take place from <strong>February 26 to March 2</strong>. Marathon arrives on PC and PS5 three days later, on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on Marathon's journey, how it looks is not the only impressive thing about it; it's also impressive to see the buzz around the game. It was always going to have an uphill battle, coming in as the game that had to shoulder Bungie's future hopes while its marquee franchise, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-revenue-way-below-projections-layoffs-playstation-restructuring/">Destiny</a></strong>, continued to flounder.  </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH AWAITS | Marathon Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marathon lost its <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-game-director-was-fired-for-misconduct-insider-says-game-is-cooked/">game director amidst a scandal </a>near the beginning of its production. It's suffered through <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/">more than one round of layoffs at Bungie</a>. It had a massive scandal regarding the game's whole artistic foundation and aesthetic being <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">ripped from another artist without permission</a>. It was <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/">delayed</a>, ad even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-not-dead-closed-technical-test-sign-ups-open/">believed to be dead</a> by some of its biggest doubters. </p>



<p>Its closed, NDA-protected beta tests <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-gameplay-leaked-closed-technical-test-bungie/">kept leaking gameplay like crazy</a>, and the last major public beta test <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-upset-was-to-arc-raiders-benefit-embark-studios/">wasn't as well-received as Bungie would've hoped</a>, even providing a solid sounding board for other games to do better.</p>



<p>Now, though, as we sit days away from launch, even though it's still far too early to say Marathon has the ability to 'save Bungie,' it looks clear that this won't be a flop. Marathon has the chance to start off strong and grow into another strong title in Bungie's portfolio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Steam Deck Consoles Be Back In Stock? Out Of Stock Status, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-explained/</link>
            <guid>1438450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamers hoping to pick up a Steam Deck in 2026 could face quite a battle, as Valve is among those who have been hit by the widespread RAM issues, leading to stock shortages.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-deck-out-of-stock-alerts-ram-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Out-of-stock alerts for Steam Deck models</a> in the United States have caused a stir, with uncertainty about when Steam Decks will be available for purchase again.</p>



<p>If you’ve encountered stock shortages when trying to purchase a Steam Deck, Insider Gaming has all the details on the availability of the console and when it could be available to purchase.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-steam-deck-be-back-in-stock">When Will Steam Deck Be Back in Stock?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Valve has provided no indication of when Steam Decks will be back available, and it could be a while until the systems are back on the first-hand market.</strong></p>



<p>Like most tech companies, Valve is having to cope with the lack of available RAM, which is also affecting the likes of Nintendo, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/should-you-buy-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potentially pushing up the price of the Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, this is completely out of their hands, and there is no indication that demand will be reduced anytime soon.</p>



<p>Valve’s storefront in the US states that Steam Deck models may be unavailable “intermittently in some regions,” and there’s no indication of when products will be back on the market.</p>



<p>The shortage of RAM is expected to remain a problem throughout 2026 and potentially into 2027, with it expected that it will cause a delay to the release date for next-generation consoles from the likes of Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-the-steam-deck-lcd-model-be-available-again">Will The Steam Deck LCD Model be Available Again?</h2>



<p><strong>No, Valve will not have the LCD Steam Deck model available again, as the console has been discontinued entirely.</strong></p>



<p>Valve is no longer making the LCD Steam Deck models, which were a cheaper entry point for fans, and will not be restocking the console on its website.</p>



<p>This means that if you’re on the hunt for a Steam Deck LCD Model, the only options available are the second-hand market, which is likely seeing a price increase, too, given the demand for the consoles.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> completely overhauls elements of the Creation Suite, including new additions exclusive to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/universe-and-community-creations/">WWE 2K Ringside Report</a> features updates to the Creation Suite. It was previously announced that the number of created wrestler slots would increase from 100 to 200. That is twice as many opportunities to create new wrestlers and bring existing non-WWE stars to your roster, either by creating your own versions or by downloading them in Community Creations.</p>



<p>It’s also now known that Create-an-Image slots have doubled. This means there are now 2,000 free slots available to create custom images. You can also find custom images on Community Creations. Nintendo Switch 2 now features the image uploader for the first time. They’ve also added the ability to use the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls for greater precision when customizing your wrestler.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-even-more-customization-options-in-create-a-superstar">Even More Customization Options in Create-a-Superstar</h2>



<p>Additionally, the Create-a-Superstar offers many more direct control options. The layer system has been improved. Previously, there were 60 layers across the entire Custom Superstar. Now, the head and body are in separate sections, while the attire options are drawn from separate pools. In total, there are 60 layers for attire and 40 for head and body. Players can also choose from 40+ body templates as a starting point and further customize the body with morphing tools.</p>



<p>Plus, there are all-new two-tone hair blending options for even more creativity and authenticity.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-not-all-coming-to-creation-in-wwe-2k26">That’s Not All Coming to Creation in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Additional updates to the Creation Suite include a revamped menu for Create-a-Championship and Money in the Bank. This section also includes new available championship parts. </p>



<p>They also added advanced timelines to entrance customizations and the ability to create victory and entrance motions for four-person and five-person stables.</p>

Classic arena shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament-2004">Unreal Tournament 2004</a> has risen from the grave and is now available to download for free, all thanks to a dedicated group of fans working with developer Epic Games' blessing. And the upshot of all this is the much-loved arena FPS has received its first patch "in over 20 years".
</p>
<p>
When Unreal Tournament 2004 originally launched, Eurogamer branded it the "mother of all first-person shooters", praising its massive map roster, its 32-player Onslaught mode, and the welcome introduction of vehicles. All that was enough to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-ut2004-pc">earn it ye olde 9/10</a>, and plenty of other people loved it too. However, support for Unreal Tournament 2004 officially ended in 2022, when Epic terminated its legacy online services and pulled the game - alongside a number of titles - from digital storefronts.
</p>
<p>
But it turns out the end was not the end. Late last year, fan community OldUnreal announced it was working to revive Unreal Tournament 2004 (the group previously resurrected Unreal and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a> 1999), patch it with bug fixes and quality of life improvements, then release it for free - all with Epic's blessing. And that day has finally arrived, with Unreal Tournament 2004 (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/unreal-tournament-2004-is-now-available-for-free-thanks-to-its-fan-community-and-theyve-even-updated-the-game-for-modern-pcs-this-is-the-first-public-patch-for-unreal-tournament-2004-in-over-20-years/">PC Gamer</a>) available to download right now.
</p>
<p>
By <a href="https://www.oldunreal.com/downloads/ut2004/full-game-installers/">heading over to the OldUnreal website</a>, interested Windows users can download and run the group's newly released installer. That, in turn, will grab the original Unreal Tournament 2004 disc image from OldUnreal's servers, extract their contents, install the game, and automatically patch it to the latest version. Linux and macOS are <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/FullGameInstallers/releases">pointed toward the group's Github page</a>.
</p><p>
"Please note that this is the first public patch for Unreal Tournament 2004 in over 20 years," project manager (and professor of computer science) Stijn-volckaert writes in the game's <a href="https://github.com/OldUnreal/UT2004Patches/releases">new patch notes</a>. "We have implemented numerous fixes and improvements, written a new SDL backend for Linux and macOS, and even a new renderer. We have also migrated the entire codebase to modern build systems. Some new bugs may have slipped in!"
</p>
<p>
So there you go! The "mother of all first-person shooters" can now be downloaded and played for free - and what better time to start revisiting some video game classics than right now, when AI companies are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-blames-dwindling-steam-deck-supplies-on-ram-and-storage-shortages-as-ai-driven-demand-further-threatens-games-industry">making it increasingly difficult to buy new hardware</a>?

<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162049/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most pleasant surprises of this month’s Partner Direct was the reveal and shadow drop of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, a compilation of some of the eponymous hero’s earliest games with some extra goodies thrown in. Though it’s ultimately little more than the sum of its parts, Super Bomberman Collection does a great job of presenting these timeless games in their best possible light. If you’re looking for a great game to play with others for some excellent competitive couch multiplayer, read on.</p>
<p>So, let’s run through what’s included here. The headlining games are <strong>Super Bomberman 1-5</strong> for the SNES, the latter three of which never even saw an official release in the US, while the first two NES Bomberman games and some boss rush modes are included on the side as fun extras. Additionally, there’s some cool museum content on display between an art gallery, music player, and original scans of the boxes and instruction manuals. It's a comprehensive and content-rich package; retro collections like these are increasingly more common these days, but you don’t always see developers going the extra mile to include as much as Konami did here.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162054/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gameplay across all five of the SNES titles is roughly the same, with more features and gimmicks as you move through each sequel. If you’re playing in single player, the aim is typically to navigate the mazes and either trip switches or defeat all enemies on-screen by dropping bombs at intersections that send fiery might in every orthogonal direction. With each blast, more breakable walls fall away and leave more of the field open, and if you happen to get caught in a blast, Bomberman goes down.</p>
<p>It can be very easy to not realize until it’s too late that you didn’t leave yourself an exit after dropping a bomb, and there’s something delightfully thrilling about tensely tracking the movements of Bomberman, enemies on the field, and various hazards as you try to navigate safely while knocking everyone else out. These single player modes are <em>fine</em>, but it doesn’t take too long before the maps start to get a little repetitive and samey. Plus, there’s just something about the generally slower pace of these levels that makes them feel more like training for the <em>real</em> game that picks up when you have some friends nearby.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiplayer is where the compilation really shines, pitting you and up to four other friends against each other in a brutal contest to be the last one standing. Balancing careful strategy with quick skill is necessary to win a given match, as you plot out how to box your foes in without accidentally blowing yourself up in the process. There’s something about the snappy nature of a two minute battle, fighting for control of power ups and scurrying away from bomb blasts left and right, that gets the blood pumping. Every match begins roughly the same, but it rapidly gets much more dynamic as the powerups keep accruing and opponents start finding increasingly more aggressive ways to corral each other into an early death.</p>
<p>It'd be enough fun on just “The Classic” map, but different stages add all sorts of new gimmicks, such as an ice level where cracks in the ice can destroy backtracking routes or a mining stage where mine carts allow players to zip around to different points. These go a long way in adding variety to the gameplay without distracting too much from the core mechanics, heaping on lots more replayability and naturally leading to the emergence of some favorites with a given friend or family group.</p>
<p>I think the real brilliance of Bomberman lies in the genius of its simplicity; although the powerups and environmental gimmicks add some welcome depth, anyone can pick it up and learn how to play in a matter of minutes due to the simple controls and concept. This makes it a very easy party game to break out when others are over, and it doesn’t take long for things to get joyously competitive in all the best ways.</p>

<p>Yet, the main drawback with the multiplayer is that there’s a puzzling lack of a native online component. which feels like something that would’ve been relatively easy to implement here and would’ve gone a long way in adding to the replayability. The main caveat to this is the Switch 2 version has GameShare functionality, which allows you to play online if you set up a GameChat room with friends, but this feels like a hokey way of implementing something of that should be simpler.</p>
<p>This being an emulated collection, Konami also saw fit to include some welcome quality-of-life updates to present these games in their best possible light. Not only do you have an array of display options such as different borders and screen filters, but there’s also support for save states and an easily toggled rewind feature. The save states help to get around the somewhat antiquated password system for marking progress through each story mode, while dropping a bomb in the wrong spot is now something you can cleanly erase by just holding down a button to rewind time a few seconds back for a do-over.</p>

<p>And though it’s certainly not the main draw of the experience, I want to point out the special attention that went into the museum content. Little touches like being able to ‘unbox’ each game and see a render of its original cartridge alongside the original box show how much the developers cared about small details. Plus, it’s really fun seeing all the handmade concept art from around the time each game launched. Game preservation is a big point of discussion these days with many games at risk of becoming lost media, and I think supplementary content like this museum is an important part of ensuring that future generations can receive these games, too.</p>
<p>One topic that bears discussion are the (few) upgrades you get with the Switch 2 Edition. Alongside the aforementioned GameShare functionality, the expected resolution bump is pretty forgettable given that you only really see it when you’re in the menus between the games themselves, and while the online gameplay via GameShare and GameChat is nice, it should’ve been in the base game to begin with. It’s only five dollars to upgrade, but I think the base <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_bomberman_collection">Switch version</a> is perfectly fine to play on either console.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Super Bomberman Collection showcases some of the very best gameplay that Bomberman has to offer. Between the various games on offer, there are dozens of hours of exciting couch multiplayer battles to be had, demonstrating that it doesn’t take the latest and greatest tech for a game to simply be <em>fun</em> to play with others.</p>
<p>Though the lack of native online is disappointing, the great gameplay coupled with some robust museum content that honors the legacy of these games makes this one a no brainer—especially given the relatively cheap price. If you’re looking for another game you can pull out on game nights with friends, I’d highly suggest you pick this one up.</p></section>

Video game updates are an incredibly funny thing, mostly because I come from a time where they weren't a thing at all, apart from the odd second printing that patched some things here and there. Which is why my humerus has been particularly tickled by the news that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has arrived today that, amongst a couple of other things, add in the ability to simply let you jump.
</p>
<p>
Yes, that's right, you can finally make like the red (or green) plumber and leap into the air with the press of a button. It's actually an option that you'll need to turn on manually in the gameplay section of the options menu, under the advanced parkour option. As silly as an addition as this genuinely does sound, I can imagine it being a minute more freeing in turns of doing sick flips, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a parkour challenge thingy you can do now too if that takes your fancy! It does not take mine, because I don't own this game, but you can get a fancy signed vinyl, a statue, and some other bits if you win.

Anyway, those other two small update bits! You can now check a detailed stat page for your loadout to get into those microdetails regarding mostly pointless decimal point percentages. The other small change with this update is that the visual feedback for critical hits has been improved, though the only change I can personally notice is that the enemy's health bar flashes red to suggest you've done one. Perhaps I should go for an eyetest soon if I'm missing something.
</p><p>
It's also probably worth reminding you all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">1200 person strike</a> that took place last week over Ubisoft's recent cutbacks, i.e. those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">big proposed job cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">recently cancelled games</a>, which includes the remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>.

              <p>Just a few weeks after launch and less than three months after it was first announced at the Game Awards, <em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>is…still alive. But its official website is suddenly down, sparking online rumors that the game is not long for this world.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2023787343409205651?s=20">As spotted by Rebs Gaming</a> and others, earlier today, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the official PlayHighguard.com website</a> was replaced with a simple static page, featuring the game’s logo and a message that says: “This site is currently unavailable.” Below that is a support email to ping about the down site. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Wildlight Entertainment for more information.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1r754vn/the_website_is_down/"> It seems the site has been down since at least 7:50 am EST</a>.</p>

A period of radio silence followed, leading to content creators filling the void with endless amounts of negative videos and online speculation running wild.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> finally did launch in January, it kicked off with over 90k concurrent players on Steam before <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">losing nearly all of them within 48 hours</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-odds-red-blue-moltres-crystal-2000669729</link>
            <guid>1438402</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve watched a lot of </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>shiny hunt</span></a><span> over the years, but somehow I’ve never actually witnessed what gaming YouTuber RaidAway just pulled off. Shiny Pokémon, the rare, alternate-colored version of the series’ monsters, were introduced in </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, but because of how these rarities spawn in the early games, it’s possible that a Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon who originates from the first generation games can turn out to be Shiny when they’re traded over. RaidAway encountered an example of exactly that, and he did it with not just any monster, but a Legendary one from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Moltres, like the rest of the Legendary Birds in </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, only spawns once per save file. You’ll find this flame-covered fowl late in the game at Victory Road, and if you fail to capture it the first time you approach it, you won’t get a second chance in that playthrough. Shiny hunting Legendary Pokémon is notoriously a hassle, as you have to reset your game multiple times, retriggering the same battle over and over, to see if you can find a rarer version of the most sought-after monsters in the game. RaidAway didn’t have to do that with Moltres on </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, and wouldn’t have been able to, as there was no indication that the bird was Shiny in the old game. However, when he traded it over to </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>, he saw the Moltres for what it truly was.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I ACCIDENTALLY FOUND A SHINY MOLTRES IN POKEMON BLUE TRANSFERING TO CRYSTAL</p> <p>THIS IS THE MOST INSANE SHINY EVER.. <a href="https://t.co/cSqFR4wRN5">pic.twitter.com/cSqFR4wRN5</a></p> <p>— Rich (@RaidAway) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaidAway/status/2023570861320548712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>How is this possible? Back in Generation II, Shiny status was determined by a Pokémon’s Individual Values, which are essentially the monster’s genetic disposition toward certain stats. So if your IVs for Attack, Speed, Defense, etc. landed on a specific number combination in the back end, they’d show up in a new color. These points still existed in the first-gen games, but it wasn’t until the sequels that they gained this additional trait. So that’s why a monster traded up can still end up being Shiny, even if you can’t clock that when you catch them in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Shiny Moltres trades the yellow body of the original for a pink one, which means not only that this statistical anomaly is an impressive stroke of dumb luck, but that RaidAway also wound up with a prettier version of the bird. He explains on X that he was working on a </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i> <a href="https://x.com/RaidAway/status/2023783654636556441?s=20"><span>Living Dex</span></a><span>, which is a term for when a player has captured one of every Pokémon in one game. Typically, Shiny hunting is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344"><span>an arduous task</span></a><span> that can take hours of banging your head against a wall until one shows up. But sometimes you get lucky and find one by accident. It’s just not often that it’s a Pokémon as rare as Moltres.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hasbro has provided confirmation that the highly anticipated GI Joe game featuring Snake Eyes has not been cancelled. </p>



<p>Atomic Arcade’s GI Joe Snake Eyes title is something that players have heard close to nothing about since its announcement. We have only heard that the game moved to pre-production in 2023, and there was a listing in 2024 that hinted at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gi-joe-could-be-an-open-world-game-according-to-recent-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a>. No other update since then, but it seems the title has survived. </p>







<h2 id="h-atomic-arcade-reportedly-shut-down-but-gi-joe-snake-eyes-is-not-cancelled">Atomic Arcade Reportedly Shut Down, But GI Joe Snake Eyes is Not Cancelled</h2>



<p>The confirmation that GI Joe Snake Eyes is not cancelled comes from a Hasbro statement to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wccftech</a>. Hasbro has stated that the game is not cancelled, but the development team is in the process of determining the way forward for the title. No decisions are final as of now, and updates will be provided as soon as they can. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<em>The Snake Eyes game is&nbsp;not cancelled. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven’t been finalized, we’re committed to providing updates as soon as we’re able</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The statement came in response to the original report, which discussed a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-ugcPost-7429184369929539585-DIod?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADh_g-QBx3rdrvALH0qxv35Q0muLbIQKclU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> post by Atomic Arcade’s gameplay programmer, Dominic Braun. Braun’s post states that he was “affected by Hasbro’s and Wizards of the Coast’s decision to close Atomic Arcade.” Hasbro has not provided clarity on whether Atomic Arcade has been shut down. </p>

<p>A LinkedIn update reveals that PlayStation’s God of War 2018 and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarok, have generated over $1.4 billion in revenue. </p>



<p>God of War is easily one of the most popular franchises on Sony PlayStation, as was evident at the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, where both announcements from the franchise stole the show. Now, we have received some numbers on how the recent games in the series have performed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-2018-and-ragnarok-have-made-over-a-billion">God of War 2018 and Ragnarok Have Made Over a Billion</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/god-of-war-reboot-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richfleider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> update by the Senior Managing Producer for Art at Santa Monica Studios, Rich Fleider, reveals that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok have easily crossed a billion dollars in sales. The update on their profile states, “God of War (2018) &amp; God of War: Ragnarök (Sony PlayStation) – Record-breaking Metacritic scores &amp; $1.4B+ combined sales.” Fleider was responsible for the studio’s largest art team, 70+ internal artists + 100s of external partners worldwide.</p>



<p>Both God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok have been released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. The 2018 title marked a significant shift for fans, as their beloved character Kratos returned on a new console while exploring a brand new mythos: Norse mythology. The sequel, Ragnarok, built upon the original game’s foundation, offering players an even deeper narrative and introducing additional gameplay elements.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-final-preview-turning-every-race-into-a-street-fight</link>
            <guid>1438390</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer doesn't ease you in. Within seconds of the first race, a car zoomed past me and detonated — parts scattering across a rain-slicked tunnel — because an opponent activated Strike mode and clipped the wall at full speed. That's the tone of this anime-inspired combat racer, which is kind of like Wipeout meets Mario Kart, but instead of picking up shells to shoot at the competition, every vehicle is equipped with a powerful device called the Echo, which gradually converts defensive energy into offensive firepower. Here, you have to weigh your decisions carefully instead of hoping to drive over a particular item. The satisfyingly complex resource management system underneath gives Screamer a tactical backbone that neither of those games attempted. After a few hours with a pre-release PC build, the arcade racing already has a confident mechanical identity — fast, physical, and surprisingly deep — and while the story mode serves primarily as a tutorial for those systems, the arcade racing is where Screamer's identity truly shines. What I played suggests that Screamer's combat racing foundation is strong enough to carry the weight the developer is placing on it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sync or Swim</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer's central system is built around two resource meters that sit on opposite sides of the HUD, and the interplay between them sets it apart from the combat racing pack. On the left, Sync — the defensive resource — builds passively over time and actively through skilled play: cornering well, timing gear shifts, maintaining speed through turns. Sync powers your Boost (hold LB for a sustained speed increase) and your Shield (tap RB, which costs one full Sync tank and provides temporary protection against incoming Strikes and Overdrive hits). When you spend Sync on either of those actions, it converts into Entropy, the offensive meter on the right side of the screen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Entropy is where things get dangerous. Two bars of Entropy activate Strike (press RB), which grants a temporary speed burst during which any opponent you collide with explodes — a full KO that removes them from the race temporarily. Fill all four Entropy tanks and you unlock Overdrive (click both thumbsticks), which turns your car into a flaming battering ram that detonates everything it touches. The catch is lethal: during Overdrive, hitting any track barrier detonates you instead. It's the most powerful tool in Screamer, and it punishes even a slight misjudgment with the same instant death it dishes out.</p><p>I felt like I was making real decisions at 200 miles per hour, not just button mashing.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversion loop is what makes this more than a standard boost-and-shoot racer. Boosting spends Sync but generates Entropy, which means aggressive drivers who constantly burn speed are also passively building toward their combat abilities. Shielding spends Sync and directly banks one tank of Entropy, so even a defensive play feeds the offensive meter. Every race becomes a rolling calculation: do you burn Sync on a boost to close the gap, or bank a Shield to both protect yourself and charge toward a Strike? Do you spend two Entropy bars on an immediate KO attempt, or hold out for the full Overdrive? The system teaches restraint through its own logic rather than through punishment, and even on balanced difficulty, the races produced a rhythm that felt strategic rather than purely chaotic — I felt like I was making real decisions at 200 miles per hour, not just button mashing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The right thumbstick handles drifting, and this is the control that makes Screamer's handling feel distinct. Rather than braking into corners, you pull the right stick to execute a drift that whips the car sideways through turns without losing meaningful speed. Once you internalize the two-stick rhythm — left for steering, right for drifting — the movement stops feeling like you're fighting the car and starts feeling like you're commanding it. There's also an upshift system: over the course of a race, you manually shift gears to increase your top speed, which layers a progression curve onto each race rather than just the meta-game. The cars have weight to them, too. Not the sluggish, input-delay kind — more like the satisfying heft of something that wants you to feel every collision and every wall scrape. Consecutive clean upshifts without collisions also accelerate Sync generation, rewarding precision beyond individual inputs. Meanwhile, hitting a barrier at speed costs you momentum but doesn't destroy you (unless you're in Overdrive), which keeps the racing forgiving enough to stay fun while the combat systems layer on the tension.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Built Different</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer's initial boot experience demonstrates surprising care. Players can choose between a Quick Start, which throws them directly into the action, or a Guided Setup that walks them through video, audio, and accessibility options. The accessibility suite is particularly comprehensive, featuring: full one-handed control remapping for either the left or right hand, complete with automatic throttle and the ability to reassign every input to a single side of the controller; deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia colorblindness filters with adjustable intensity on a scale of one to ten; independently scalable subtitle and menu text sizing; and a tinnitus reduction filter with configurable frequency (default ten kilohertz) and gain (default negative twelve decibels). This level of audio accessibility is rare in racing games, and its upfront inclusion, rather than being buried in a submenu, is commendable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Streamers, meanwhile, will immediately appreciate the licensed audio content toggle. A single switch disables copyrighted music before going live, eliminating the need for third-party workarounds. This small inclusion demonstrates an understanding of how people actually play and broadcast games in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview was played on PC at a 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution, where the visual style looked impressive. The arcade modes ran smoothly on medium settings with DLSS set to balanced, delivering solid visuals: neon-soaked tracks popped with color, car models showed visible collision damage, and the sense of speed remained strong even without maxed-out post-processing. The graphics menu is highly granular, offering individual sliders for anti-aliasing, post-processing, effects, shadows, reflections, global illumination, texture quality, foliage, and shading, as well as upscaling options across Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR 4.0, and TSR, with frame generation support for compatible hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One final note: Screamer offers five AI difficulty tiers, ranging from Very Easy to Very Hard, along with driving aids, including arcade throttle (automatic full acceleration), neural throttle and brake assist, neural steer and drift assist, and neural handling for cornering and wall avoidance. While these are useful options, they are hidden within the custom game settings rather than being presented during the initial setup. For a game that otherwise prioritizes accessibility so effectively, burying the driving aids behind layers of menus feels like an oversight that could unnecessarily challenge less experienced players during their initial races.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Full Roster</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the fifteen characters is split across five teams of three — one Leader and two Members per squad — and brings a unique passive ability that meaningfully alters their playstyle. For example, Frederick's Reaper's Dance empowers his Strike and grants bonus Sync on KO, but makes him explode on contact with track barriers while Striking — a high-risk, high-reward tradeoff. Hiroshi's Unstable Boost extends boost duration the longer you hold it, rewarding players who can maintain clean racing lines. Roisin's One More Freckle reduces Strike's Entropy cost and allows it to chain continuously, turning her into a relentless close-range threat. Only a handful of characters were accessible in the arcade build, but the differences between them were pronounced enough that swapping rosters changed your approach to the same tracks.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The character and world design leans heavily into an anime aesthetic, which sets the tone for Screamer's hero shooter-esque vibe. Screamer's opening cutscene uses fully animated, cel-shaded sequences to introduce its tournament cast — veterans and newcomers assembling for the Screamer Tournament, run by a figure named Gage who installs the Echo device on every vehicle. The voice acting, at least in the brief cinematic that played before the crashes began, is standard English-dubbed anime: serviceable, occasionally cheesy, and tonally consistent with the art style.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Echo system — which in gameplay terms is the Sync-to-Entropy resource loop — is positioned in the lore as the bridge between narrative and mechanics, justifying why these racers can blow each other up. It's an ambitious framework. However, the preview build’s story mode, which includes six episodes of anime-driven narrative with special race rules, functions effectively as a tutorial for Screamer's systems but struggles with pacing and presentation. The dialogue frequently interrupts races mid-action to deliver exposition, and at least from my first impressions during the opening segments, the character writing lacks the personality needed to justify the dramatic framing. It's functional, but the arcade modes remain the stronger draw.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rules of the Road</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Arcade mode, where I spent most of my time for this preview, offers substantially more customization than the genre typically provides. Three preset race types — Free For All (all fifteen racers on the grid), Leaders (just the five team captains), and Members (the ten sidekicks) — each produce distinct competitive dynamics. Free For All is maximum chaos, with fifteen vehicles jostling for position as Strikes and Overdrives erupt across the pack. Leaders is tighter and more personal: a five-racer sprint where every KO matters. Members sits in the middle, offering ten-racer fields with a different tactical flavor, since sidekick abilities tend toward more specialized functions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The custom ruleset editor is the real surprise. You can adjust lap counts up to nine, set competitor numbers up to sixteen, and toggle from a long list of modifiers that reshape the racing experience: deactivate Overdrive entirely for a pure racing mode; disable all fighting mechanics to remove Strikes; toggle off individual character skills; force permanent Overdrive for every racer from the opening lap; adjust passive Sync generation rates; activate Power Shift (where Active Shifting unleashes a massive speed surge); enable Volatile Ecosystem mode where all racers are permanently vulnerable to KOs; or turn on Gage's Finest, which prevents vehicles from losing parts on collision — essentially a no-destruction cosmetic mode. I didn't test every permutation, but the breadth suggests serious potential for community-driven rulesets and custom competitive formats.</p><p>There's also an upshift system: over the course of a race, you manually shift gears to increase your top speed, which layers a progression curve onto each race rather than just the meta-game.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Race adds another layer. Duo and Trio variants allow mixed teams across factions, as long as a Leader is present, and scoring combines final placement points with KO tallies. Smashing your own teammates hurts your combined total, which creates an interesting wrinkle when everyone is fighting for position in the same pack. The map selection across the preview's initial tracks — Port, Downtown Run, Route 1N, Stadium Olympus — offers a strong mix of environments, and I even noticed a fifth map unlock as a reward for playing the mode. Tight urban corridors lined with neon signage give way to wider circuits with sweeping elevation changes, and day versus night settings noticeably affect visibility and atmosphere. Repeated arcade play also unlocked a new character, new music, and cosmetic items, hinting at a progression system that rewards continued engagement — though how deep that progression goes remains an open question.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Waiting for Green</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After spending a few hours exploring the arcade modes, what emerged is a combat racer with a genuinely clever resource system, meaningful character differentiation, and a custom ruleset editor that could give Screamer real longevity. The Sync-to-Entropy conversion loop forces players to think two steps ahead, spending defensively to build offensively. This tactical layer elevates Screamer's racing above the typical grab-a-pickup-and-fire template. Milestone's expertise in crafting racing games shines through in every drift, boost, and well-timed Strike.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some big questions remain. It's unclear whether the writing of the much broader campaign arc ultimately does justice to the character-driven structure, whether the pacing between cutscenes and races ends up feeling earned, and whether the campaign's special rules add meaningful variety beyond what exists in the arcade mode. These unanswered questions are central to Screamer's overall appeal, but for now, Screamer's strong racing foundation warrants attention, and I look forward to its upcoming March 26 release on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-final-preview-turning-every-race-into-a-street-fight]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4db50b949082a"><a title="Mewgenics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4db50b949082a/mewgenics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Edmund McMillen</em></figcaption></figure><p>14 years after it was first revealed (yes, <em>14 years</em>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/binding_of_isaac_afterbirthplus">The Binding of Isaac</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> co-creator Edmund McMillen finally launched <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Mewgenics</a></strong> last week. This turn-based tactical roguelike where you breed cats has been a huge hit on Steam, selling over 500,000 copies and taking the crown for the highest concurrent player count for a roguelike of all-time <em>ever</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II.</a></p>
<p>Naturally, desire for a console port has only grown since release, but McMillen has reassured fans on <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">social media</a> that the team is "working on" a console release (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">Eurogamer</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8romwtg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>That surely includes either Switch 1 or Switch 2, and thanks to some digging by <a href="https://nintenduo.com/mewgenics-juego-mejor-valorado-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintenduo</a>, Switch 2 is absolutely in consideration, depending on the publisher.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/comment/o4aw6ju/">r/SteamDeck</a>, McMillen held an AMA right before the game's 10th February release date, and when someone asked about a PlayStation 4 or 5 version, the developer confirmed "we are deciding on a publisher now and defer to them when it comes to what they feel is worth developing for".</p>
<p>But of all the consoles out right now, McMillen thinks that "Switch 2 seems like the front runner right now".</p>

<p>That sounds extremely promising, but as mentioned, it really does depend on who the publisher is and what they recommend. Regardless, it's not going to be a super quick progress, but we hope Mewgenics makes it to one of Nintendo's hybrid consoles.</p>
<p>And we think it's pretty likely given that McMillen's other games are already available on Switch. Mewgenics is currently the highest-rated game of 2026 on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20055/mewgenics">OpenCritic</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/">Metacritic</a>, so getting it on even more eyes feels like a no-brainer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Will Hand Out Suspensions to Players Who Took “Severe” Advantage of ARC Raiders Coins Duplication Exploit]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/</link>
            <guid>1438363</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">issued a statement</a> regarding a major glitch in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> that players have been exploiting recently, which allowed players to duplicate their <strong>coins</strong>, essentially destroying the in-game economy and allowing players to buy their way back to full strength and then some, if they lost their gear while <strong>Topside</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether the statement will apply to you or not depends on how much you took advantage of the exploit. For "<em>severe cases</em>," the players who took huge advantage of it will be <strong>suspended</strong> from the game. How long those suspensions last is currently unclear, but that is the action Embark will go with if it deems your abuse of the exploit to have "<em>had a significant impact on the in-game economy or other players’ experience</em>."</p>



<p>If you just dabbled with it, then you'll simply be issued a warning. Also, it should go without saying that all players who took advantage of the exploit will have the coins earned through the exploit removed from their accounts.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>Thank you to everyone who sent us reports of the recent duplication exploit, and to everyone who continued playing in good faith while we took the time to properly investigate the issue.<br>Starting this week we will begin issuing enforcement actions to… <a href="https://t.co/VatYFM7ljV">pic.twitter.com/VatYFM7ljV</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2023752363853463637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game’s economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance</em>," writes Embark Studios. "<em>Over the course of this week, we will begin issuing enforcement actions to accounts that we can confirm took advantage of these exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark goes on to explain that it took as long as it did to respond to these exploits because it wanted to do a thorough investigation to not only discover and fix the issue, but to make sure that it fairly addressed the players who abused the exploit without over-punishing those who perhaps used it once or twice.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing. This is the first time we’ve handled an incident of this nature at such scale in ARC Raiders. Rather than rushing, we chose to take the time needed to fully understand the situation and make sure our response was consistent with our values and expectations.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark continues, "<em>It's our hope that this response provides a platform for future action, and we’ve already improved our detection and tracking, internal review tools, and safeguards to limit the impact of similar exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We take this incident seriously, and we’re approaching it as both a corrective effort and a learning opportunity to strengthen the systems that support fair play.</em>"</p>



<p>So if you had your fun with the exploit, it's clear to say that not only is that done, but Embark has no time for players who look to these exploits. With how well ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">continues to sell</a>, these kinds of problems are bound to pop up, and it's good to know for the players who want an even playing field that Embark does not play around with these kinds of problems.</p>

			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026</strong> has already seen the release of some excellent games, with many more on the way, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> is poised to dominate the gaming year in terms of sales, as the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">double dela</strong>y</a> did not dampen the excitement surrounding the highly anticipated next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The next entry in the popular series is not the only open-world game launching this year, and of them, <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>' <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/">Crimson Desert</a></em></strong> could be the <strong>Game of the Year</strong> if, by any chance, <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> ends up failing, according to a former <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> animator.</p>



<p><em>"This game, this could be Game of the Year, okay. Mark my words,"</em> former <strong><em>GTA V</em></strong> and <strong><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></strong> animator <strong>Mike York</strong> stated in a recent breakdown of <strong><em>Crimson Desert</em></strong>’s features. <em>"And the reason for that is because of how much you can get lost in this game... it really is a contender when it comes to all the cool stuff all this game kind of has to offer."</em></p>



<p><em>"If GTA VI drops the ball, this could be Game of the Year,"</em> <strong>York</strong> added during the recent analysis. <em>"If GTA VI wasn't here at all this year, this (Crimson Desert) would probably take Game of the Year, from what it looks like."</em></p>



<p>Clearly, there's a lot that is still unknown about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crimson Desert</em></strong>, especially how such a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/"><strong>diverse set of features and mechanics</strong></a> will come together, and if the game's story will be memorable. However, from what has been seen so far, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mike York</strong> feels <span><strong>cautiously optimistic</strong>&nbsp;about the game, especial</span>ly regarding its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">physics-based interactivity</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mechanical depth</strong>, with an impressive level of detail in the world-building. Coming from someone with <a href="https://mikeyork.wixsite.com/demo/resume"><strong>an impressive resume</strong></a> who has worked on some of the best games ever, this sounds like some very high praise.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, it's the followup to the well-received JRPG <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. Like its predecessor, the game alternates between exploration segments and turn-based battling, and it's got tons of Digimon combinations for you to discover as well.</p><p>The game sees you traveling between the real world and the digital world in order to unravel a mystery that spans not only multiple realities, but also time itself.</p><p>Just like <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>, you'll be tackling a main story quest that spans hours and hours of JRPG gameplay, as well as sidequests and a very in-depth Digimon rearing system.</p><p>You can check out the trailer for <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>'s brand new DLC pack right here. It's a teaser, so it doesn't give too much away, but it should give you an idea of what to expect at any rate.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last June, Jagex - the developers of medieval MMO Runescape - found themselves at odds with players after deciding not to create any new content for Pride Month. Disputed internally at the studio before the discussion then leaked online, the decision appeared to be a retreat in the face of a world turning on minority groups.</p>
<p>Following up in September, Games Industry asked Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy if he stood by the call to simply re-run existing Pride-themed quests and events. "Ultimately, my job is governance and protection as much as anything else, and so sometimes those kinds of harsh decisions have to be made to protect the imminent future of the game," he told them. "If there are tough decisions to be made next year, we'll make them. If the world has changed a bit and the environment is different, we will react accordingly."</p>
<p>Five months on and with this year's Pride Month on the horizon, we've asked if the environment is different.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I must admit there's another reason why I'm asking these questions of Jagex now. When I visited the developer's Cambridge studio last month to hear about their plans for Runescape, its Old School release, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>-like spinoff, Runescape: Dragonwilds, I didn't ask about Pride or last year's controversy, focusing instead on its 25th anniversary.</p><p>When I published my article on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-fight-for-runescapes-sharksuit-but-jagex-were-having-none-of-it-its-for-the-greater-good">changes Jagex are making to Runescape</a>, I was asked in the comments why there was no reference to the studio's decisions last June. In light of that oversight, I've gone back to ask Jagex's plans for Pride this year and if their decision was influenced by plans to hold in-person events in the US.</p>
<p>You can find the questions I asked and Jagex's answers below. But if you're not familiar with the context, let me give you a rundown of what happened.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/06/10/runescape-pride-2025/">PinkNews</a> reported that Jagex's then new CEO, Jon Bellamy, told staff in April they would not be running any Pride Month content in Runescape or Old School Runescape in June, instead focusing more on "what players wanted". The report quotes one staffer saying the decision showed the company was "catering to American conservatism", connecting the announcement to the fact Jagex's new owners, CVC Capital Partners, have a portfolio with many US investments.</p><p>Following Bellamy's initial message and pushback internally, the CEO held a Q&amp;A with the team.“I understand that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>… is precious because it is a safe space, it is an escape from reality, and the reality that we find ourselves in is changing," Bellamy is quoted as saying. "It is getting stranger, more troubling, less moral, I would argue. Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect."</p>
<p>In response to an open letter from staff, Jagex said they would run pre-programmed Pride content. That June, Jagex reactivated the <a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Tales_of_Pride">Tales of Pride event</a> in Runescape. First added in 2022 and re-run every Pride Month since, this is a questline that sends players to different people within the world to hear stories about asexual, bisexual, gay, and trans characters who have played a part in Gielinor's world. Completing the quest earns you a set of cosmetics, such as a banner, a shift, and a flower crown.</p>
<p>Separately, the community organised the Community Pride Event within Runescape, something they have been doing since 2020. As in previous years, this began as an in-game parade and ended in an after party. A similar parade was held in Old School Runescape.</p>
<p>In previous years, Jagex have run Pride-themed quests in Old School Runescape. In 2017, there was <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gilbert%27s_Colours">the Gilbert's Colours event</a>. Then new quests in <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2022_Pride_event">2022</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2023_Pride_event">2023</a>, and <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2024_Pride_event">2024</a>. Unlike Tales of Pride, each quest was unique and provided players newly-created cosmetic items. There wasn't a new quest added in 2025, nor was an old quest reactivated.</p><p>When our colleagues over at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-why-jagexs-new-ceo-is-happy-for-it-to-be-the-runescape-company">Games Industry</a> spoke to Bellamy in September, he told them, "I totally sympathise with what's being said. At the top of my totem pole will always be the continuity and operation of our games as apolitically as possible, because ultimately our games offer escapism to many hundreds of thousands of players every day. If that escapism opportunity is compromised, there's a very real risk to the business."</p>
<p>That brings us up to date. And so this is what I asked after posting my article last month.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Last year Jagex paused development of its Pride month content. Pink News reported that Jon Bellamy said Jagex would stop supporting the event to avoid a "backlash" and that "Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect.” He also is reported as saying that “The content.. is now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously, risk that I’m personally responsible to protect against.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that an accurate account of what he told staff? </strong></p>
<p>This was part of a broader discussion about a rapidly changing global environment and Jagex’s responsibility to protect the long-term health of the game and safeguarding the studio and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be supporting Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be developing any new content for Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>What pressure was Jagex feeling that it needed to stop supporting Pride? Or, if it wasn't feeling pressure, why did it volunteer to stop supporting an event that celebrates a minority group?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>What message does it send that Jagex wasn't willing to withstand the fear of a backlash for supporting a Pride event in-game? </strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>In my discussion with Ryan Philpott, he said "Some of the changes we're going to make might make some of our current players less than happy, but it's for the greater good of the game long term." Is cutting Pride an example of this?</strong></p>
<p>No – given nothing has been “cut” from the game in terms of inclusive representation or existing Pride-related content.</p>
<p><strong>Jagex is running an event in the US this year. Would Jagex be able to run Pride events in RuneScape and host an in-person event in the US, or does one preclude the other?</strong></p>
<p>The two are unrelated. In-person events are about celebrating our community and engagement; in-game content decisions are about what fits the world and how we develop it.</p>
<p><strong>In his opening speech at the event, Jon highlighted the success and growth RuneScape is enjoying. Would that growth and success not have been possible if the developer supported Pride?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As in 2025, then, Jagex will be running the Tales of Pride event in Runescape. They will also support community run events in Runescape and Old School Runescape. However, and I've been back to confirm this, they will not be creating any additional quest content for Pride Month in 2026.</p>

Think again.</p><p>Unlockable after completing the game, New Game+ reimagines the first seven chapters of <em>Total Chaos</em>, twisting familiar locations into far more hostile gauntlets and culminates in a brand-new final chapter: “Chapter 8: Reckoning.” Each existing chapter begins with a warning: something has been unleashed. Once The Hunter finds his target, there is no way to stop him. Survival depends on speed, awareness, and decision-making under pressure.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1027223"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>In addition to The Hunter, enemy encounters are significantly more aggressive, resources are brutally scarce, and hesitation is punished. New Game+ is not designed for comfort. It is a deliberate escalation, intended for players willing to face Total Chaos at its most unforgiving. It is meant to push players to the absolute brink, and even after all hope is lost, it continues to punish. </p><p>Beyond its mechanical escalation, New Game+ also expands Total Chaos’ narrative. A new ending extends the story beyond its original conclusion, offering new context for the protagonist’s descent into Fort Oasis—and what it all ultimately meant.</p></blockquote><p><em>Total Chaos</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,449 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,750 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/total-chaos/9phtx5qz035t" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a teaser trailer below.
