		<p>Warhorse Studios has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a> is getting an upgrade for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, free for existing PS4 and Xbox One owners, and that it’s out today.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance | Next-Gen Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0_5x0wEPDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The current gen upgrade for the original game comes as an anniversary treat for its sequel, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, which is celebrating having sold 5 million copies in the past year.</p>
<p>This could be a great way to draw more players into the game because, while Warhorse were keen to make sure that you didn’t&nbsp;<em>need</em> to have played the first to enjoy the story told in the second, there is always that compulsion amongst gamers to start at the very beginning, isn’t there?</p>
<p>Playing Kingdom Come: Deliverance on PS5 and Xbox Series will now mean enjoying the title at 60fps, helping to make the game more responsive on console than before. Additionally, visual fidelity has been enhanced with improved graphical features. This update has been made with assistance from Saber Interactive.</p>

<p>Warhorse CEO, Martin Frývaldský, said, “I’m&nbsp;incredibly proud to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance II reach this monumental milestone.&nbsp;I&nbsp;want to thank everyone at&nbsp;Warhorse Studios,&nbsp;our publishing partners at&nbsp;PLAION&nbsp;and of course, it&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;be possible without our amazing&nbsp;and ever&nbsp;growing&nbsp;community. Thank you for being&nbsp;part of this journey and making this a reality!”</p>

<p>What immediately jumps out to tech-savvy gamers are the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM requirements</strong>.

<p>The original <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, which is among the most complex PS3 games ever released, ran on the measly <strong>256 MB</strong> of the system.

A worthy play for any fan of the series, which has finally returned to the spotlight following its <strong>long absence.</strong></p>

In fact, you don't have any longer to wait at all!</p><p>That's right: <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>is coming to current-gen consoles today, and if you already happen to own the game on PS4 or Xbox One, then you'll get a "next-gen" upgrade for free.</p><p>The upgrade will allow you to experience the game's realistic rendering of early 15th-century Bohemia at "up to 60fps", which presumably means it will come with performance and fidelity modes on the newer consoles, a feature that doesn't exist on previous-gen machines.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as the increased frame rate option, you'll also be able to take advantage of sharper visuals and smoother performance across the board on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, making the current-gen versions of the game the best way to play if you're on console.</p><p>News of <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s appearance on current-gen consoles comes after Warhorse and parent company Embracer announced that sequel <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe50d517-d627-4fd8-90a9-f33dfd15cfc7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has sold five million copies</a> since launching last year.</p><p>The first game is no slouch in the sales department either; it's sold over ten million copies at time of writing, a figure that will no doubt increase further now that more people are able to access it.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it's an action RPG that emphasizes realism and historical accuracy over the usual dragons-and-wizards malarkey (which has its place!). The game is set in 15th-century Bohemia and follows the story of blacksmith's son Henry as he gets embroiled in political intrigue.</p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, and it's dropping on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S today as well.

<p>Just like in the GOG version, you can expect some modernizations and improvements as part of the Steam release of <em>Dino Crisis </em>and <em>Dino Crisis 2</em>, including increased rendering resolution, modern controller support with "optimal button binding", and an improved internal renderer, plus lots more.</p><p><em>Dino Crisis</em>' Steam release rather puts paid to Shinji Mikami's comments about <em>Dino Crisis </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dda2b172-c260-4104-9653-3c47ee717026" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">no longer being relevant thanks to <em>Monster Hunter</em></a>; it seems there's room for both to exist in this storied world of ours.</p><p>These re-releases are nice on their own, but it's even more tantalizing to imagine that they might represent a revival for the <em>Dino Crisis </em>franchise as a whole.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first two<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768"><em> Dino Crisis</em></a> games, originally released on the PlayStation 1 back over 25 years ago, have finally made their way over to Steam. That’s cool, but uh, wait a minute here, did Capcom include performance-killing DRM on these retro releases? Yes. Yes, it did.</p> <p>On February 12, Capcom announced a fun little surprise for <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-new-dino-crisis-merch-event-sequel-remake-horror-2000616659">Dino Crisis</a> f</em>ans. No, it wasn’t a new game or a remake or even a fancy remaster. Instead, Capcom revealed that 1999’s <em>Dino Crisis</em> and its 2000 sequel, <em>Dino Crisis 2,</em> were now available to buy on Valve’s large digital PC gaming store, Steam. As mentioned already, that’s cool. I mean, the games have been available on GOG for a bit and can be easily emulated on fairly weak PCs, but it’s always nice to see publishers bringing older games to more platforms and stores. Except, fans quickly spotted something silly:<em> Dino Crisis 1 </em>and <em>2</em> on Steam include Engima Protector DRM.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Playtime is officially over, kiddies!</p> <p>Dino Crisis and Dino Crisis 2 have finally stomped their way on to Steam.

Really? What’s wrong with these guys?” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4249130/discussions/0/796709978759016171/">asked one user.</a> Others pointed out that this is the same DRM that Capcom <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182">recently added to its years-old <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake.</a> And that was a disaster, causing all sorts of performance problems for many users on PC.</p> <p>This is made all the more strange by the fact that these<a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-1-2-pc-gog-drm-freelancer-ff7-1851750391"><em> Dino Crisis</em> PC ports seem to be the same versions being sold currently on GOG</a> with zero DRM. For whatever reason, Capcom has decided that the same games available DRM-free on GOG should include crappy DRM that people hate if you buy them on Steam. As you can expect, a lot of people are opting to buy<em> Dino Crisis</em> on GOG until Capcom removes the DRM.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="6087ea604cbd1"><a title="Virtual Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6087ea604cbd1/virtual-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well, what a lovely surprise! Our local Royal Mail representative knocked on the door today and delivered a curious-looking box, and it turns out that it's none other than the Virtual Boy accessory for Nintendo Switch Online!</p>
<p>Yes, it seems like a whole bunch of people – in the UK, at least – are receiving their retail Virtual Boys early, and so we were lucky enough to get our very own purchased unit.</p>
<p>We've already gone <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/five-takeaways-from-my-time-with-virtual-boy-on-nintendo-switch-online">hands-on with the peripheral and app</a> over at Nintendo of Europe in Frankfurt, so you should definitely check that out if you want a few thoughts on the experience itself.</p><div><figure data-videoid="aHspT9aiKKE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytaHspT9aiKKE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHspT9aiKKE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed40228bvuptli&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>Of course, we've still got a few days to wait until the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> app launches (<strong>17th February</strong>), so we can't really get a whole lot of use out of the headset just yet. What we have been able to do, mind you, is see what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s VR mode looks like, and yeah, it's pretty wild stuff.</p>
<p>The main point is that it works – to a degree. Booting up the VR mode in Odyssey lets you view stages just like you could with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo VR</a> set; just pick up the Virtual Boy and move your head around, job done.</p>
<p>The main issue is that you can't really control Mario at the same time, so unless you're willing to fashion a really big rubber band around your head to keep the headset locked in place, it's not an ideal solution.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out here that Nintendo offered a statement to confirm that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online">Labo VR won't be officially compatible with Virtual Boy</a>, but given these limited tests, we're of the mind that it will at least function to a certain degree. We'll be able to confirm one way or the other when the app itself launches.</p>

<p>As standard, the Virtual Boy comes with a red lens filter, which means that Odyssey had this weird, almost retro-inspired presentation clearly geared toward the upcoming NSO app. It's actually quite cool in practice, but we should note that you can quite easily remove the red lens from the headset, leaving you with a pair of clear lenses that look remarkably similar to Labo's.</p>
<p>With the red filter off, Odyssey looks just like it does when played with Labo, but again, moving your head around while controlling Mario unfortunately isn't really possible with the Virtual Boy.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it's, well... a Virtual Boy! I never owned the original, given that it never came out in the UK, so I can't really comment on the feel or heft of the thing, but in terms of presentation at least, it's a dead ringer.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy to lift the visor up to slot the Switch 2 inside, and the set also comes with an added bit of plastic to allow your original Switch to fit. Similarly, although removing the red lenses took a little bit of force at first, it was very easy to do once it's been taken out at least once.</p>


<p>We'll have a lot more coverage for you when the Virtual Boy app drops on Nintendo Switch Online next week. For now, we're going to clear a bunch of space off our office desk and display with pride.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metaphorrefantazio-director-says-clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-truly-inspiring-and-conveys-a-deep-understanding-of-jrpgs/</link>
            <guid>1435408</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's a new game bundle on <strong>Steam</strong> that lets you pick up what are arguably two of the best RPGs in the last few years on one discount. Developers <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> and <strong>ATLUS</strong> have joined together to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">form a bundle</a> including both <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> and <strong>Metaphor: ReFantazio</strong>. Both games are currently on sale separately, but you can grab them together in a bundle for <strong>10%</strong> off their combined price, and it's a bundle that both sides are proud to be a part of.</p>



<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio creative director and writer <strong>Katsura Hashino</strong> said that he was "<em>very pleased</em>" to know that Metaphor would be put together with Expedition 33, a game that he had his own personal high level of praise for.</p>



<p>"<em>I am very pleased to hear that a Steam bundle will be released with&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em>, a title that has received high praise around the world," Hashino said in a press release. "<em></em><em>Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;is a work that <strong>conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre</strong>, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, <strong>I found it to be truly inspiring</strong>."</p>



<p>"<em>I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches</em>," Hashino continued. "<em>While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, <strong>players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre</strong>. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer</em>."</p>



<p>It cannot be overstated how significant this kind of praise is from such a legend of the JRPG genre. <strong>Persona</strong> fans will know Hashino's work well, as he's been one of ATLUS' key creatives behind <strong>Shin Megami Tensei</strong> and Persona for many years.</p>



<p>For Sandfall Interactive's part, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 creative director and Sandfall's chief executive officer, <strong>Guillaume Broche</strong>, had his own reverie towards ATLUS, Metaphor: ReFantazio and the work that Hashino and his team have accomplished over the years, citing them as inspirations for his love of JRPGs.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>&nbsp;is a game that is really inspiring for us," Broche said. "<em>It tells a beautiful story in a completely new world that is masterfully crafted. It deals with heavy themes but one that resonates strongly with me is the </em><strong><em>importance of imagination in all aspects of our lives</em>.</strong>"</p>



<p>"<em>The cast is lovable and the turn-based battle system is one of the best I have played. The re-imagination of the traditional jobs system through Archetypes is fantastic and opens up so many playstyles that are fun to play around with. On top of that, the game has one of the most charismatic villains I've ever seen in an RPG</em>. <em><strong>It is a great honor to be able to collaborate with ATLUS on this bundle</strong>, as I have been a fan of their work since&nbsp;</em><em>Shin Megami Tensei™: Lucifer's Call&nbsp;</em>(also known as&nbsp;<em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>&nbsp;for some players)."</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/">Wccftech's staff and community pick for Game of the Year in 2025</a>. We also gave it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong>9.5/10</strong> when we reviewed it at launch</a>, while Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">received a <strong>9/10</strong> from us</a> when we reviewed it in 2024.</p>



<p>Both are two of the best RPGs you can play right now, with this new Steam bundle being a great chance to pick up both if you're a fan of RPGs and JRPGs but have somehow not tried either of them yet.</p>

<p>This is new and therefore special, but this is also old and therefore special is essentially the driving point made by an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/12/legacy-of-kain-ascendance-new-stylistic-direction/">Xbox Wire post</a> penned by Legacy of Kain: Ascendance lead writer Claribel Guerra. The game, a 2D action platformer revealed by Crystal Dynamics during last night's PlayStation State of Play, is the first new Legacy of Kain since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance. Defiance, as it happens, is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-defiance-is-getting-a-proper-remaster-includes-a-demo-of-a-never-before-seen-canceled-game">getting a remaster next month</a>.</p>
<p>In Ascendance, you play as Kain, Raziel, and Elaleth - the former two voiced by returning voice actors Simon Templeman and Michael Bell. The game itself's a weird mishmash. "Ascendance’s 2D side-scrolling presentation and pixel art aesthetic immediately stand out, evoking the era when the series first emerged," Guerra wrote. "That approach is paired with PS1-era-inspired 3D sequences and anime-influenced cinematics, bringing major story moments to life while nodding to the franchise’s first leap into 3D with Soul Reaver. The experience centers on combat and atmosphere, challenging you to master movement, read enemy patterns, and stay in control under pressure."</p><p>While there doesn't look to have been many specifics of the story yet, Guerra insisted that "the world remains bleak and oppressive; the themes are heavy with fate, power, and consequence". "The game’s narrative unfolds across multiple eras, connecting familiar characters and moments from the series’ history while expanding on ideas that were previously only implied," they added.</p>
<p>So, they assert, old heads won't be put off by the upping of pace in terms of actions. You'll still be stopping to figure stuff out and take in key happenings, rather than locked in a constant rush.</p>
<p>Will that actually appeal to clapped-out Soul Reaver enthusiasts like my dear vaycaying colleague? We'll find out when Legacy of Kain: Ascendance comes out on March 31st this year. Or just whenever Edwin's back in. Either way, you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4233530/Legacy_of_Kain_Ascendance/">Steam</a>.</p>

              <p><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>, a cozy farming sim from developer and publisher Seed Sparkle Lab, released in Early Access on February 11 and things are already off to a rough start. Kickstarter backers have reported not receiving their release codes, the Xbox Series version is reportedly a mess, its $20 cosmetic DLC ticked off its crowdfunding backers, and the “</span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starsand-island-devs-remove-unreasonable-clauses-from-the-games-eula-promise-more-features-and-fixes-in-coming-updates"><span>virtual goods</span></a><span>” clause in its EULA has raised some eyebrows.</span></p> <p><span>Those issues were quickly overshadowed by a wave of seemingly suspicious Steam reviews posted for </span><i><span>Starsand Island </span></i><span>at launch, many of which were reportedly from users with less than an hour of total playtime and zero other reviews listed on their profiles. I say “reportedly,” because while several threads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CozyGamers/comments/1r2r2ou/the_emerging_starsand_island_controversy_what_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit</span></a><span> and the Steam </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2966320/discussions/0/756177397086247029/"><span>discussion board</span></a><span> have discussed said reviews, dozens of these suspicious reviews have since disappeared from </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s </span></i><span>Steam page.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately for the devs, the <em>Starsand Island</em> Steam review rapture ended up bringing even more attention to the game’s strange launch. Yesterday, Seed Spark Lab released a </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772"><span>community update</span></a><span> post on the life sim RPG’s</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Steam page and its official Discord titled “Announcement Regarding Artificial Comments.” It takes aim at the “large number of overly positive ‘praise’ comments about </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span> appearing across various social platforms.”</span></p> <p><span>“Is this some kind of overpraise as an attack? We have no concrete evidence, but it does feel as though someone may be doing this intentionally,” posits Seed Spark Lab. “What makes it even more puzzling is that this approach is not cheap, since leaving a review requires purchasing the game. (We later discovered that some of these accounts refunded the game after posting their reviews.)”</span></p>

 <p><span>They also noted that they believe the majority of these overly positive reviews “appeared to be AI-generated,” and “kindly” requested that whoever is behind the reviews “to stop.” Naturally, regardless of whether Seed Spark Lab’s plea was made in earnest or not, the community post has drawn </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1r2wn61/please_let_us_focus_on_making_our_game_in_peace/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>even more negative attention</span></a><span> to </span><i><span>Starsand Island</span></i><span>. There really is no way to prove who is behind the reviews, so there’s little point in pointing fingers, but I have to wonder how anyone would benefit from damaging </span><i><span>Starsand Island’s</span></i><span> reputation by trying to inflate its rating on Steam. Reverse review-bombing with AI bots? What will PC gamers think of next?</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last night's Sony State of Play broadcast ended with an announcement and shadow drop for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War Sons of Sparta</a>, a side-scrolling spin-off listed as having 1-2 player support via the PlayStation Store. The only problem? Fans can't find its two-player option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from those who've paid the game's $29.99 asking price and revisited Kratos' origins say that his sibling Deimos only appears at certain points, there's no two-player option in the game's menus, and plugging in a second PS5 controller doesn't provide extra options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an odd situation that's led some to suspect the PlayStation Store <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012744" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listing</a> is simply incorrect — as it appears to be the only firm evidence a two-player mode exists — and seek help from others online also searching for its multiplayer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/13/screenshot-2026-02-13-130432-1770993202798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">God of War Sons of Sparta, listed for 1-2 players. Image credit: PlayStation/IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on reddit and social media, fans say the store's listing didn't initially seem odd — since the game's title is "Sons of Sparta" plural, in-game footage shows the two brothers killing bosses together, and its cover artwork focuses on them fighting side-by-side. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's store description could also be ready ambiguously, referencing the exploits of both brothers: </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Experience an untold chapter in Kratos' journey set during the harsh years of Spartan training alongside his brother Deimos," Sons of Sparta's official blurb reads. "Through endless trials, their minds, bodies, and hearts have been molded to become Spartan soldiers for whom duty and honor mean everything. After a fellow cadet goes missing, Kratos and Deimos vow to find him and embark on an adventure that will put their training and Spartan spirit to the test."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just got it installed and running," wrote God of War fan Mephistocheles on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r38od8/god_of_war_sons_of_sparta_metroidvania_announced/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, in a lengthy thread with much discussion on the game's lack of co-op play. "So far it's not allowing drop in play on 2nd controller and there were no two-player options on start menu. Will update if I find it does allow co-op, but it doesn't look like it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m so sad," wrote bob_th4_build3r. "I bought it instantly because i thought it would be co-op… maybe they will add it in the future?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other comments say they are now escalating the matter to PlayStation's customer support, while several fans say they have tried to request refunds. IGN has contacted PlayStation and Sons of Sparta developer Mega Cat Studios for clarification on the game's two-player capabilities, or lack thereof.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's State of Play show also included the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-side-scrolling-spin-off-out-today-and-god-of-war-trilogy-remake-announced-sony-state-of-play">surprise announcement of a God of War Trilogy Remake</a>, though work on the project at Sony Santa Monica is still in its early stages.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-writer-hopes-zaum-never-becomes-a-aaa-studio</link>
            <guid>1435393</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“Even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities.”</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer ZA/UM may have had a significant hit with 2019’s Disco Elysium, but it remains a reasonably small studio. And, at least as far as writer and VO director Jim Ashilevi is concerned, that’s how things should remain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio,” he said during a recent interview with IGN. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">ZA/UM currently employs just under 100 members of staff, many of whom work remotely from different places across the world. Its has offices in Tallinn, Estonia; London, UK; and Porto, Portugal, and the company remains independently owned. While this is admittedly a bigger outfit than many indie developers enjoy, it’s still small-scale. And that’s how Ashilevi likes it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we're always deeply encouraged and inspired by the indie scene because that's where the fresh ideas come from,” he said. “The avant-garde stuff always happens on the fringes, and I hope we'll never become a triple-A studio. Honestly, even if Zero Parades sells four billion copies, I hope we are wise enough to stay true to our core sensibilities and values as artists and storytellers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of that conversation, Ashilevi offered his assessment of the gaming landscape. “I think it's grim out there,” he said. “I think the industry is in a really rough place. We all know that. But I don't think the industry is in a rough place creatively. I think, in a way, it's better than ever. It's better than ever before because anyone can make a game that touches the hearts of hundreds of millions of people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The comment came in reference to the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which, while developed on a much higher budget than any of ZA/UM’s projects, was 2025’s demonstration that there’s an enormous appetite for single-player, story-led games produced outside of the mega-publishers’ circles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the industry has become less gatekeep-y in a way,” he said. “But that also presents another problem, which is how do you even begin to promote your game, or make sure that it actually finds its audience? I think really the only thing you can control is whether you're staying true to your own vision and your own voice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we explored earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/power-comic-books-and-zero-parades-for-dead-spies-how-zaum-found-its-disco-elysium-successor"><u>that vision has been ZA/UM’s “North Star” when it comes to Zero Parades</u></a>. “For that reason, I'm already really proud and happy with what we've done,” says Ashilevi. “It's like the response coming from the players – which will hopefully be positive, mostly positive – is almost just a bonus at this point. The real value I got out of it as a storyteller was just getting to know my friends and colleagues a little better and getting to know more about what goes on in their hearts and minds and souls.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from ZA/UM, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zero-parades-and-disco-elysium-developer-zaum-on-ai-we-dont-use-it">the studio’s stance on using AI</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zaums-new-rpg-is-similar-to-disco-elysium-because-were-still-the-same-people">why its new RPG resembles Disco Elysium so closely</a>.

Known to fans around the world as ‘Pokémon Day’, 2026 will be a special 30th anniversary celebration! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate, The Pokémon Company has recently dropped a 30th Anniversary Pokémon Day TCG Collection, featuring a specially stamped foil Pikachu promo card, a metallic coin featuring the 30th anniversary logo, and three booster packs from Phantasmal Flames and Mega Evolution.</p><div id="234519"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234519" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proving a popular set, Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection is stocked at all major retailers. However, navigating the market requires a bit of strategy; prices are fluctuating from its original $49.99 launch price. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the week following its release, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a07ekA?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGplayer</u></a> reported a low sale price of $18.79. That’s a decent drop from the launch price, though it’s back up to around $26.98 market price at the time of writing. Still, that's a significant 58.87% drop in resale value in just a month, making this all the more affordable for fans to pick up right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking for the lowest "in-stock" price right now, direct from a major retailer, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Day-2026-Collection/dp/B0G2FVLXVL/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36VQRZIV3UEAJ&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fpJDom5qEWmKC0FcSlN6VIskxWDbsXrw_vz63nbDXOnPWWrJIH7xP97VRCaDCHQoaTT0Ax7GTdN5nAlTKd8v0h9qirbSbiiEWD7eKZwOhLB-lNHalc47TcMFdCpXSBpPCg-DQ0-aLHK6CIw_iviZoheXuUpnyGVWClbf0bjytHgyS6KktRc0tr9vVcWTSni_lAL_vwiFH5wcas89RIfpjBp9RReM80I2BPu6NENeqB5DzDIyrVlAZKqGB5VFaoUy2icu9opjnW-xVdPVcgpB8oJ8vCyIA96S2gcHIWaaKbg.dCTp1x9Nb8Laf8Ks31TMSiKjSHnlOi-hH0k2yZJu17s&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection&amp;qid=1768584789&amp;sprefix=pokemon+pokemon+day+collection%2Caps%2C210&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=tcg-ign-20&amp;ascsubtag=06U9e7yJctIoHdAg4l1vnCG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Amazon</u></a> leads the pack at $34.45 (a 31% discount from MSRP). That being said, we’ve seen them dip <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-day-2026-tcg-collection-is-back-in-stock-with-a-major-new-discount-at-amazon"><u>as low as $26.99</u></a> here before, so it’s up to you if you want to hold for that or opt for TCGplayer instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Q45Eq4?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a> is holding firm at $49.99, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/aR72pE?object_uuid=a60c8e55-21b1-4f63-af47-e53122b1cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Target</u></a> has already been cleaned out of their $17.99 stock - a price so low you can’t be surprised!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hunting for a sub-$20 pull, it’s best to keep an eye on local inventory or set up an alert for online restocks from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg"><u>reputable resellers</u></a>. Just remember - these figures are based on US retailers, so international collectors should factor in global shipping costs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to resell yourself, I’d recommend you keep looking. Given the lack of exclusive anniversary packs inside, it’s not likely the Pokémon TCG's 30th Anniversary TCG Collection will turn over a huge profit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, while the stamped foil promo card of Pikachu isn’t a unique illustration, its status as the first official 30th-anniversary product might be worth something to completionists in a few years. I’d recommend picking up two at or near MSRP if you’ve got the space - one to hold onto as an investment, one to rip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-full-release-schedule-2026"><u>one more Pokémon TCG set</u></a> to be released in the first quarter of the year - Perfect Order.

"When we added most of the people on the list it was ages ago, like, Ethan was included a good four years back," McMillen explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wanted the game to feature a huge array of iconic voices I’ve been hearing echoing across the internet for most of my time making games. As some probably noticed, I was all over the place when it came to cameos and did my best to include and keep ones that clashed or kinda counterbalanced each other. The inclusion of Ethan and Hila [Klein] was counter balanced by iDubbbz and Anisa," he added, referring to two creators who have publicly supported Palestine. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I made sure to contact both to make sure they were okay with the others' involvement so it didn’t feel like a weird gotcha on release," McMillen explained. "They were both very adult about it and said they had no issue with the other being added, and I really respected that, since I know they have been publicly feuding for a while now. It’s hard to explain without revealing aspects of the game people haven’t really experienced yet, but the inclusion of people with clashing ideologies felt appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McMillen concluded: "I understand we live in a time where a meow from someone who has different beliefs as you is scary and frustrating, confusing and controversial… but it felt interesting, so I decided to explore it. Also, I should probably point out that I don’t share the same opinions as, well, probably any of the people we included. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If I only included people who share the same exact opinions as me, I’d be the only one meowing in the game. I included Chris, but also liquid Chris (those who know, know)... I didn’t [realize] Matan [Evan, an Israeli-American YouTuber] was controversial, I mean a lot of these people are characters doing bits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other notable inclusions on the list of vocal performers include Stranger Things star David Harbour and Supernatural's Felicia Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN thought Mewgenics was 'Amazing.' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>It returned 9/10 in our review</u></a>, in which we wrote: "Mewgenics is a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we're not the only ones having a good time with it; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot"><u>Mewgenics recouped all of its seven-year development costs within three hours of its launch on February 10</u></a>. "So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot," co-creator Tyler Glaiel told IGN.

			<p>The 1930s was the golden age for detective fiction. This decade was the most prolific for esteemed crime novelist, Agatha Christie, who published around a third of her crime novels during this era, including many of her most iconic titles. It’s no wonder then that the 1930s is the prime setting for a detective murder mystery.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clue: Murder By Death - Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Yeuc51KHiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Clue: Murder By Death, developer, Cocodrolo Games jumped onto the 30s detective steam train to great effect. Like all good 1930’s murder mysteries, Clue: Murder By Death is set in an isolated, upper-class country estate with an impregnable storm raging outside. The manor house is perfectly characterised with oak-panelled corridors, drawing rooms, libraries and the occasional secret passage to explore. Cut off from the outside world, the circle of characters is made up of the usual suspects; the murdered wealthy aristocrat, his questionably moral family members, the odd shady guest or two, and the gossiping servants.</p>


<p>In fact, Clue: Murder By Death isn’t just packed to the rafters with 30’s crime novel tropes, it also pulls in popular trends from other cultural corners of the era, such as Egyptology and the newly popularised Dracula movie. The setting for the game was clearly well researched and planned, making the gamer feel fully immersed in the storyline.</p>


<p>Visually, the game does a nice job of reflecting the popular board game it is based on. Your detective moves from place to place, one room at a time, investigating objects and chatting to suspects. The characters are designed to look like playing pieces, and while their lack of features can sometimes make it hard to tell who’s who – why are there so many indistinct servants?! – the overall look has a welcomingly cute, cartoony appeal.</p>
<p>But what of the gameplay itself? Clue: Murder By Death has a notable two-hour real-time playthrough feature. A thrilling idea on paper, but just a bit awkward in reality. Once you start the game, the timer begins to tick down. From here, the player must complete the game within two hours. Want to eat your tea? It’ll have to wait. Need to put your kid to bed? They know where their own toothbrush is. Come back after two hours is over and the game resets, eliminating all progress you’ve made. There’s no record of anything you’ve discovered or unlocked in that time – you’d better have a good memory – and you have to start all over again from the beginning. The first time this happens is pretty galling, but from then on, it’s just exhausting.</p>

<p>The great irony behind the two-hour real-time feature is the playthrough pacing that goes alongside it. As the timer starts to count down, you prepare to jump into the storyline in a race against time to find the killer, only to find that your detective moves at less than a snail’s pace. Suddenly, the room-by-room exploration becomes tedious as your character pitter-patters along a useless stretch of corridor just to move into the loading screen for another useless stretch of corridor. In fact, nearly every room you visit is preceded by a blank screen, breaking the flow and cause a feeling of disconnection.</p>
<p>As you begin to unlock each section of the map, the dawdling pace starts to grind. You finally find an object that will help to solve a clue on the other side of the manor, but the map is so huge and you’re so darn slow, there’s no way you’re getting back over to that side of the house anytime soon. Forcing you to undertake the journey, knowing full well you’ll have little time left to proceed much further, forcing you to do it all that boring walking again on your next playthrough. The developers clearly spotted this unfortunate setback and included the option to add two of the suspects to your detective team. Although this lets you spread your resources around the mansion, it doesn’t do enough to reduce the tedium of character walk-speed and room-to-room loads.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Clue: Murder By Death fully immerses the player in a thoroughly realised 1930’s era country estate murder mystery with the welcome addition of cute, cartoony visuals. Sadly, the game is somewhat let down by a frustrating two-hour real-time playthrough limit that collides with tedious character walking speeds and frequent clunky load screens.	</p></div>

            <guid>1435357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="3ef78997ce374"><a title="MGS4 PS3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3ef78997ce374/mgs4-ps3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We all saw it coming, but Konami has now finally confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> is heading to Switch 1 and 2, bundling <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots-master-collection-version">Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-peace-walker-master-collection-version">Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/metal_gear_solid">Metal Gear Solid: Ghost Babel</a> in one package.</p>
<p>I'm especially pleased to see MGS4 finally freed from its PS3 shackles. As the concluding chapter in the chronology (Snake's chapter, specifically – yes, I see you waving there, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/metal_gear_rising_revengeance">Raiden</a>), Guns of the Patriots is an indulgent mess of a game; one that attempts to tie up an overwhelming amount of loose threads. It's gotten a pretty bad rap as a result, largely thanks to its lengthy cutscenes and numerous scripted gameplay segments.</p>
<p>I absolutely love it, though, warts 'n all. It's pure fan service from start to finish, bringing back characters we hadn't seen since the first <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid">MGS</a> while chucking in a load of easter eggs right, left, and centre. Chances are most fans know how MGS4 plays out at this point, but if you've only just begun your journey with Snake on Switch with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/metal_gear_solid_master_collection_vol_1">Master Collection Vol. 1</a>, I urge you to go into the fourth entry as unspoiled as possible.</p>
<p>Which brings me nicely onto today's topic of conversation, so if you're worried about spoilers, now's the time to leave!...</p>
<figure data-uuid="baa27832cbbd0"><a title="MGS4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/baa27832cbbd0/mgs4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Konami</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When MGS4 launched on the PS3 back in 2008, it really went out of its way to stress that it was a console exclusive – sorry, Xbox 360 owners! As such, it contains a few distinct references to PlayStation that I'm fairly confident won't be present in the upcoming release on Nintendo's consoles.</p>
<p>The most obvious reference occurs when (SPOILER!) Snake returns to Shadow Moses Island to stop Liquid Ocelot from stealing Metal Gear Rex's Rail Gun. As you head through the familiar environments, you eventually come to the point where, in the original PS1 MGS, the game would prompt you to swap discs. Otacon even calls Snake to inform him of this, only for the conversation to specifically reference the PS3, noting that the Blu-Ray technology utilised means that swapping discs is no longer required.</p>
<p>It's a fun little conversation that, for old-school PS1 owners, brings back some fond memories – something MGS4 strives to do at almost every turn.</p>
<p>So what the heck happens with this conversation on Switch? Is it just deleted entirely? My gut says that this is probably the case, but for the sake of authenticity, I really hope it remains in some capacity.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, Konami would get Christopher Randolph back in to record new Switch-specific lines. Honestly, I'd crease myself laughing if he said, "Oh wait! We're on a Game-Key Card now! All the data is downloaded!"</p>
<p>Come on, you know it's funny.</p>

<p>That's not the only thing. If you look around closely enough while in the game's Nomad sections, you can spot <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fmgs4-what-game-is-sunny-playing-on-the-psp-v0-xo7386wd37ge1.jpeg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3Dcb031a5c8e46f1d4cba6615ab6ff1dd368d99bcb">Sunny playing on the PSP</a>. There's also a reference to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/zone_of_the_enders_the_2nd_runner_mars">Zone of the Enders: 2nd Runner</a>, a title produced by MGS creator Hideo Kojima and, at the time of writing, one that has yet to grace Nintendo platforms. Finally, a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/saturn/policenauts">Policenauts</a> poster is displayed in the environment at a couple of points in the game. With both titles, however, neither is locked to PlayStation, so I suspect both with remain.</p>
<p>Vol. 1 retained a lot of the quirks from the original releases, albeit with minor alterations. For example, MGS1 still prompts you to change the disc, even though this is merely done through a menu option. Similarly, PlayStation button prompts instructed via the Codec are still very much intact, though the game mutes any accompanying dialogue from the voice actors in this case.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating conundrum, and I'm curious to see how Konami handles it all. Funnily enough, there's also a real, branded iPod in the original release for MSG4, and you can use it to play all sorts of music while working your way through the game. Will this be replaced, too?</p>

<p>Nintendo itself probably won't be too keen on having explicit references to a rival company mentioned in the collection. The recent release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/console-archives-cool-boarders">Console Archives Cool Boarders</a>, for instance, very carefully notes that the game originally launched on "a 32-bit home console" in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Console-Archives-Cool-Boarders-3016638.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqy-t7jNWwG5fC5pX7R93H9vhatwn9GJia0hv4yXdh3KoGMbpSz">official blurb</a>. Nintendo putting its foot down, or Hamster not wanting to take any risks?</p>
<p>There's also the curious case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/hyperdimension-neptunia-and-death-end-switch-releases-scrapped-for-not-complying-with-nintendo-guidelines">Hyperdimension Neptunia being barred for the Switch in the West</a>. I'm merely speculating here, but the series' focus on parodying the real-life 'console wars' may have rubbed Nintendo the wrong way.</p>
<p>Granted, there are plenty of direct nods to all sorts of consoles in the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/worms_armageddon_anniversary_edition">Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration">Atari 50</a>, but I'd argue that showcasing these in a museum-like context is a little different, and so they can probably get away with it.</p>
<p>Many questions linger, then, but I'm excited to finally play MGS4 on a not-PS3. It's been a long time coming, man.</p>

<p>Solve the case today</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're someone who loves a little bit of Agatha Christie, or maybe you're partial to the <strong>Knives Out</strong> movies, then Cocodrolo Games and Dolores Entertainment may have something just for you with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/clue_murder_by_death">Clue: Murder By Death</a>, and it's out on the Switch eShop... today! (No mysteries there.)</p>
<p>As you can probably tell by the title, the game is heavily inspired by British murder-mystery stories, particularly from around the 1930s, but it's the almost board game-like presentation that has us intrigued. Each character looks like something you'd move around on a <strong>Monopoly</strong> board or, we don't know, a cuter version of <strong>Cluedo</strong>.</p>
<p>And, as you'd expect, murder is at the centre of the story. Lord Robert Anderson is dead, and you have two hours to find his killer and solve the murder. But you won't just be playing as a detective, as you'll be swapping between multiple different suspects and characters.</p>
<p>Each character has their own perspective on basically everything — the way one person sees a vase is different to another, for example — adding layers to the overall mystery.</p>
<p>There's also a bigger mystery to solve involving the mansion, where the murder takes place. During each replay, you'll come to understand more of the complex home. With 166 rooms to explore,there's no way you can do that in a single two-hour session, right?</p>

<p>Out now on Switch (and other platforms), you can grab Clue: Murder by Death on the eShop for <strong>£18.00 / $19.90</strong> (or your regional equivalent). Plus, if you're in the UK, there's a 20% launch discount until 5th March.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Best RPG winners <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> are together at last. Sega revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/66136/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33_x_Metaphor_ReFantazio/">a new Steam bundle</a> that gives you an extra 10 percent off both games if you buy them together. That’s over 175 collective hours of drama-filled, turn-based dungeon grinding if you go the completionist route. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> director Katsura Hashino used the occasion to celebrate <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s breakout success last year.</p> <p dir="ltr">“<em><span>Expedition</span>&nbsp;<span>33</span></em> is a work that conveys a deep understanding of and sincere dedication to the JRPG genre, crafted with great care down to the finest details. As someone who also creates RPGs, I found it to be truly inspiring,” Hashino, who’s been designing RPGs at Atlus since the 1990s, said in a press release. At a time when many franchises in the genre have moved toward more action-based combat, <em>Clair Obscur</em> showed turn-based mechanics could still keep evolving and appeal to a more general audience.</p>

 <p dir="ltr">“I am genuinely delighted to see Japanese-style RPGs being born and embraced, not only from Japanese-based studios like ours, but other places around the world through diverse creative approaches,” the <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-english-release-date-announcement-1851780429"><em>Persona 5</em> director continued</a>. “While the two titles differ in their worlds and overall direction, players may find a shared spirit in how we each approach and express the RPG genre. I hope that this bundle encourages players to experience both titles and enjoy the breadth of what RPGs can offer.”</p> <p>Sandfall Interactive CEO And creative director Guillaume Broche had equally kind words for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a grittier fantasy RPG than Atlus’ usual games with shades of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. “The game has one of the most charismatic villains I’ve ever seen in an RPG,” Guillaume noted. He added that he’s been a big fan of Atlus’ work dating back to 2003’s <em>Shin Megami Tensei: Lucifer’s Call</em>, or as it was known in the West, <em>Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne</em>. That happened to be the first game in the series directed by Hashino himself.</p>

 <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">Hashino predicted a new renaissance</a> in the genre would lead to the birth of “JRPG 3.0.” While he didn’t say exactly what that would entail, he suggested it would include an innovative rethinking of the core concepts fans have come to expect from those types of games. “There will be a greater dimension to these games and they’ll change the genre’s structure and presentation at a fundamental level,” he said. For now there are more than enough JRPG 2.0 releases to keep people busy.</p>

<p>If you live for wild shooters infused with skateboarding mechanics, then you need to be playing High on Life 2. The new sequel from Squanch Games is just as loud (if not louder) than the first game and also brings with it another big Trophy List.</p>



<p>Maybe there aren’t enough games about talking guns, and that’s what the whole galaxy should consist of? Then again, maybe not, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> has a certain, can’t-look-away, need-to-hear-everything charm that few other titles deliver. We were quite complimentary in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/high-on-life-2-review-a-faster-funnier-sequel/" id="176022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2 review</a>, and if you do pick it up, you need to know the High on Life 2 Trophy List.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-high-on-life-2-trophies-amp-achievements">All High on Life 2 Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>As expected, the High on Life 2 list engages in tomfoolery with the names of the trophies and achievements. They play heavily into the game’s skateboard influence, and there’s even a nice touch on the classic 1991 ‘All your base are belong to us’ meme!</p>

<p>When you’re looking for a new game to play, how long it takes to beat is a valid aspect to consider. Starting a game can be a commitment, especially if you’re purchasing it, and it’s nice to know what you’re getting yourself into.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, everyone is different. Some of you might be looking for an expansive, hundred-hour RPG, whereas others might prefer a shorter, more condensed experience. If you’re wondering which category <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High On Life 2</a> falls into, then you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-high-on-life-2">How Many Hours To Beat High On Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There’s a lot to do. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>If you play High On Life 2 casually, focusing on the main campaign whilst exploring some of the open areas, you should expect to complete the game in around 10 hours. </strong></p>



<p>High On Life 2 is a fairly structured game. There are open maps to explore and collectables to find, but there’s a linear narrative that you’ll be following. As you hunt down more of the Big Pharma targets, you’ll head to new areas, but you don’t need to spend any time there that you don’t want to.</p>



<p>Instead, you’re more than welcome to focus simply on the main missions, and if you do that, you can easily complete the game in under 10 hours. It’s great if you’re just there for the plot, but there’s more of the game to enjoy if you’re willing to put the time into it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-high-on-life-2-completionist-run">How Long Is A High On Life 2 Completionist Run? </h2>



<p><strong>If you’re aiming to 100% High On Life 2, you’re looking at around 25-30 hours, assuming you embark on every side activity—and hunt down every Luglox.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a nice variety of activities to complete in High On Life 2, such as hunting down Skate letters or clearing Wanted Posters, but the real time sink will be finding every Luglox. </p>







<p>There are 199 to find across the three different maps, and they even include the tiny green ones that store some Pesos. Thankfully, they show up on your mini map when you’re near them, but more often than not, you’ll still need to search around.</p>



<p>Don’t worry if you missed any during missions, though, as thankfully, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a> has added Luglox Exterminators.

We already knew it was coming thanks to an early <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-pc-port-leak-esrb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ESRB rating</a>, but the release date was the main concern.
