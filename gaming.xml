			<p>Remember Bad Robot Games? The gaming studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-tencent-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded around seven and a half years ago</a> by Bad Robot's JJ Abrams, in partnership with Tencent. It was supposed to bring JJ Abrams' SPYJINX project, originally<a href="https://wccftech.com/jj-abrams-partners-chair-create-spyjinx-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> a decade ago, to fruition. In April 2020, it seemed like <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-and-bad-robots-spyjinx-resurfaces-as-a-mobile-game-beta-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were still working on it as a mobile game</a>, but the project was eventually quietly canceled.</p>



<p>Thankfully, that's not all Bad Robot Games was doing. In February 2021, former Left 4 Dead creator Michael S. (better known as Mike) Booth <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-robot-games-is-working-on-an-awesome-coop-multiplayer-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that he had joined the team to create an outstanding cooperative multiplayer shooter game.</p>



<p>Today, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it has signed on as a partner to produce and publish this title, which will be released for PC and PlayStation 5. Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Partnering with Sony Interactive Entertainment allows us to bring our new IP to life, with an expansive vision for this new universe. With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</em></p>



<p>Christian Svensson, VP and Head of 2P/3P Content Ventures &amp; Strategic Initiatives at Sony Interactive Entertainment, added:</p>



<p><em>We’re greatly impressed with the talent Bad Robot Games has assembled at their studio, and are thrilled to partner with them to help produce and publish their upcoming game. Their unique creative voice and passion for innovating across all forms of interactive entertainment perfectly aligns with SIE’s mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players. We can’t wait for gamers to step into the world they’ve been building.</em></p>



<p>There are no further details, so the game's status is unclear. Still, Bad Robot Games has been working on it for a considerable amount of time, as outlined above. Hopefully, that means it won't be long until we can play it. </p>

			<p>This week's GeForce NOW Thursday reveals the full list of PC games being added to the cloud platform's library in December 2025. </p>



<p>One of these games is 2023's best-selling title by Avalanche Software, Hogwarts Legacy. Moreover, GeForce NOW users are finally getting access to the first Activision titles to be made available on Ubisoft+. As you might recall, part of the deal that unlocked Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-resctructures-activision-blizzard-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the sale of cloud gaming rights to Ubisoft</a>. Subscribers to Ubisoft+ Premium can now play games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and the Spyro Reignited Trilogy on GFN, with more to be added later.</p>



<p>Today, NVIDIA kicks off the Half-Price Holiday sale. Premium GeForce NOW memberships are available now through December 50 (while supplies last) at 50% off for the first month for a limited time. Starting today, members can also link their Battle.net accounts directly to GFN for automatic single sign-on across all supported devices, making it easier to access Battle.net games via cloud.</p>

              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made. I think I’m more impressed by the new ways it finds to be obtuse than anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics. Gating features that would be standard in most games is so weirdly hostile that I’m surprised Nintendo gets away with it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650512">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, the Samus amiibo looks great, but do keep in mind it’s not to be confused with the </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> Samus figure that includes her bike. That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>

              <p>As we soar right toward the end of the year, all our Instagram and Twitter feeds are now expectedly inundated with Spotify Wrapped. The music streaming platform’s end-of-year personal summaries always make for a fun time of defending you’re quirky top 5s or lying that, “I only really use Spotify when my kids are in the car. I&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> didn’t listen to 5,247 minutes of ‘This Is What It Sounds Like’ from&nbsp;<em>K-Pop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>on my own!” It’s okay. Me too, buddy.</p>
<p>Part of Spotify Wrapped is the platform automatically makes a playlist for you of your top listened-to songs of the year. So why not give your faves, your absolute bangers, your cream of the crop the justice they deserve by blasting your songs over a brand new JBL Flip 7 Bluetooth speaker? A<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6201/">mazon actually has the portable speaker on sale at the moment for 27% off.</a> The JBL speaker normally goes for $150, but the discount takes $40 off the top, leaving you only having to pay an easy $110 for a limited time.</p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="44"><strong data-start="0" data-end="44">Louder, Clearer, and With More Powerful Sound</strong></h2>
<p data-start="46" data-end="331">The JBL Flip 7 features a two-way speaker system that delivers stunning sound with impressive bass. The woofer handles deep lows and midrange frequencies, while the tweeter produces crisp, high-end notes—combining for a rich, dynamic audio experience that you can both hear and feel. The long-lasting battery provides up to 16 hours of playback on a single charge, so you’ll have plenty of time to enjoy your music, all day or nearly all of it.</p>
<p data-start="333" data-end="840">Take your music anywhere with the portable JBL Flip 7. It’s designed for on-the-go use, including both a loop and carabiner. The speaker has an IP67 rating for waterproof and dustproof protection. So it doesn’t matter whether you’re by the pool or at the beach, you can enjoy your tunes in almost any environment. Its durable fabric and rubber exterior are built to withstand rough conditions and minor impacts.</p>


<p data-start="842" data-end="1148">The JBL Flip 7 comes in a variety of colors to suit your personality. Choose from vibrant shades like red, blue, green, pink, or opt for the camo version. Just be careful not to set it down in the grass. If you prefer a more subtle look, there are also sleek sand, white, and black options available.</p>
<p data-start="1150" data-end="1400">Like other recent JBL Bluetooth models, the Flip 7 supports PartyBoost, allowing you to pair it with other compatible speakers to create stereo or surround sound. This is perfect for parties or events where you want to fill multiple rooms with music.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bad-robot-games-sony-four-player-shooter-left-4-dead/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed the imminent arrival of a new four-player, cooperative shooter from Bad Robot Games, the gaming division of JJ Abrams’ Bad Robot. The title is being directed by Mike Booth, best known for leading the charge on Left 4 Dead, one of the best games in the genre and a cult classic.</p>



<p>The game was revealed as being in development for PlayStation 5 and PC, and while details are scarce at present, more will be revealed soon.</p>







<h2 id="h-mike-booth-is-back-in-the-studio-and-cooking">Mike Booth is Back in the Studio and Cooking</h2>



<p>In September, we covered the news that Mike Booth, the creator and designer of Left 4 Dead, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/left-4-dead-coded-shooter-coming-from-game-creator/">was developing a new shooter</a> ‘built on the foundations of what made L4D special.’</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and Sony Interactive Entertainment has revealed a partnership with Bad Robot Games that will serve as the creative pathway for that game to come to life.</p>



<p>On Reddit, Booth wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m Mike Booth (creator of Left 4 Dead), and I’m excited to share that I’m working on a brand new project —a 4-player co-op shooter built on the foundations of what made L4D special.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.</p>



<p>We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re opening up playtests to a limited number of players. If you’re interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we’d love to have you involved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2025/sie-partners-with-bad-robot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new press release</a> on the Sony Interactive site, it was explained by Anna Sweet, CEO of Bad Robot Games:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>With the support of PlayStation, we hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 remain two of the most beloved zombie shooters ever released. They’re still popular today and are being kept alive by an extensive modding community that never ceases to innovate and optimise the game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-mumbomania-is-a-playstation-only-game-playable-in-dreams/</link>
            <guid>1372861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Moon Studios’ William Butkevicius has used their free time productively to create a whole new Banjo-Kazooie game for PlayStation owners on PS4 and PS5. It comes with a couple of minor caveats: It’s not an official Banjo-Kazooie game, and you need to own a copy of Dreams.</p>



<p>It boggles the mind that there hasn’t been a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/banjo-kazooie-co-creator-gregg-mayles-resigning-rare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Banjo-Kazooie</a> game in nearly 20 years. 2008’s Nuts &amp; Bolts remains the final BK game to see the light of day, and if you’ve got a hankering for a new release, a talented developer might have you jumping around the room.</p>







<h2 id="h-a-new-banjo-kazooie-game-on-playstation-sort-of">A New Banjo-Kazooie Game On PlayStation, Sort Of</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks like the real thing. Credit to Eupholace</figcaption></figure>



<p>William Butkevicius is a level designer at Moon Studios. They’ve been working on No Rest for the Wicked, but their spare time has involved a lot of ‘Dreams,’ it seems.</p>







<p>The PlayStation-exclusive title is considered one of the most sophisticated content generation games in the world, and the freedom and control you have to create your own levels and games in Dreams is nearly endless.</p>



<p>Butkevicius posted to X on December 3 with a fun message: “Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania is out NOW on Dreams for PS4/PS5!”</p>



<p>If you need convincing, there’s even a 1-minute and 43-second trailer showing off the game. It does indeed look like a deep Banjo-Kazooie game, and it looks terrific by every metric!</p>



<p>The way Banjo looks, the movement and mechanics, all the way down to the music—performed by <a href="https://x.com/thegamebrass" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@thegamebrass</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, this is only for PlayStation owners, and you need to have a working copy of Dreams to play it. If you meet this criteria, this might be the closest you’ll ever get to a new Banjo-Kazooie title.</p>



<p>Is it about time the series makes a triumphant comeback? Would it be amazing to see Rare back at the helm?

<p>Roblox is now banned in Russia as it has been accused of distributing extremist materials and “LGBT propaganda”. </p>



<p>The popular gaming platform, Roblox, has been in the news recently for its age-estimation features, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-age-estimation-feature-users-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some users concerned</a> about the requirement for children to upload photos of themselves to its AI tool. Now, Roblox is in the news again, for being banned in a country, accused of distributing extremist materials. </p>







<h2 id="h-roblox-negatively-impacts-the-spiritual-and-moral-development-of-children">Roblox Negatively Impacts the “Spiritual and Moral Development of Children”</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-access-us-childrens-gaming-platform-roblox-2025-12-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-banned-russia-lgbtq-propaganda-child-safety-measures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), access to Roblox has been blocked in Russia, with the country’s communications watchdog, Roskomnadzor, stating that the platform was “rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children.” Russia is not the only country to block access to Roblox; Turkey also banned the title earlier last year over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concerns of child exploitation</a>. </p>



<p>A Roblox spokesperson’s response is also included in the report. The spokesperson states that they “respect the local laws and regulations in countries” where Roblox operates, and they believe the platform provides “a positive space for learning, creation, and meaningful connection for everyone.” They added that the platform has “a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform.”</p>







<p>In other news, there was a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-roblox-shutting-down-roblox-ban-2025-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hoax campaign</a>‘ on social media and content platforms earlier this year claiming that Roblox would shut down in 2025.

In a level that looks straight out of the series' history, Banjo the bear jumps, glides, rolls and gets shot out of a cannon as he explores and hunts down collectibles. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Eupholace | William Butkevicius (@Eupholace) <a href="https://twitter.com/Eupholace/status/1996263228205080843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most impressive is the range of transformations on offer, with Banjo turned into a hulking rock golem, cutlass-wielding pirate, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally launched on the N64 in the late '90s, Banjo-Kazooie eventually arrived for Xbox 360 in 2008 following Microsoft's acquisition of developer Rare. But despite earning a legion of fans, the franchise has not seen an all-new entry in 17 years, since Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts released for Xbox 360, also back in 2008.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Banjo-Kazooie: Mumbomania Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite repeated calls from fans for a new Banjo-Kazooie to be made, Xbox has made no suggestion that a fresh title is in development — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rare-has-plotted-out-the-next-five-years-of-sea-of-thieves">Rare now seems singularly focused on making fresh content for Sea of Theives</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"You've seen from our history that we haven't touched every franchise that people would love us to touch — Banjo fans, I hear you," Microsoft's gaming boss Phil Spencer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-shouts-out-banjo-kazooie-while-talking-about-bringing-back-older-franchises">said back in 2023</a>. "But it is true that, when we find the right team, and the right opportunity, I love going back to revisit stories and characters that we've seen previously."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of being playable in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Banjo and Kazooie now feel largely forgotten. Still, fans of the duo have still had the spiritual successor Yooka-Laylee to enjoy. Developed by various members of the original Banjo-Kazooie team, the game recently got a polished-up re-release in the shape of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Laylee: Replayee</a>, which arrived in October of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The city of Wizarest has been cut off from the outside world for over a century, with its people living in isolation, stripped of their memories and surrounded by labyrinthine dungeons crawling with monsters. Claus discovers that his mentor and adoptive mother, the prodigal mage and alchemist, Giselle, has been missing since she went into the dungeons last month, and he vows to uncover the mystery behind her disappearance.</p><p>The citizens have been trying to navigate the dungeons for years but to no avail, and a century later, no exit has been found. It’s up to you, and the three artificial magical beings left to you by your mentor, Giselle, to explore the perilous dungeons, uncover the secrets behind the town’s and your own memory loss, and confront the force responsible for the world’s decay. Your friendly homunculus companions are able to absorb the souls of defeated monsters and evolve through “Anima Fusion”, allowing you to tailor your companions, changing their stats, abilities and appearance. Every decision you make throughout your adventure will affect your relationship with your companions, influence the storyline, and affect the outcome of the world’s fate, so choose your steps wisely!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Developer Neon Giant has teased an announcement on December 11, the same day as The Game Awards, for a project that the team is calling "ludicrously ambitious." That's some bonafide marketing hype, and the Swedish developer isn't revealing much more beyond that the game will focus on "player agency."</p><p>The developer added that the game will be set in a "reactive" world where "player agency and creativity" are two defining elements. It's "the kind of game that every developer wants to work on," the developer said in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-called-its-first-cyberpunk-setting-cooler-than-night-city-and-now-the-studio-behind-the-ascent-says-its-making-the-kind-of-game-that-every-developer-wants-to-work-on/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer.</a></p><p>Neon Giant previously made The Ascent, and after that game's success, studio co-founder Arcade Berg said the studio could have "asked for nearly anything" from the publishers that came calling.</p><p>Neon Giant was sold in 2022 to South Korean gaming company Krafton, the publisher of PUBG, and Berg said he and co-founder Tor Frick took the deal because they "didn't start a studio to run a studio."</p><p>"We started [Neon Giant] because we wanted to make games in a certain way," Berg said. "That's the only thing that's really important to us. So we said, well, you know what? Why not? Why not find someone to work with so we can get the rocket fuel that we feel that we need to be even more ambitious, and also feel that we have some stability, we can have the courage and afford to take risks, creative risks and project risks, because we think that will lead to a frankly cooler product in the end."</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, and GameSpot will bring you all the news and reveals as they happen.

<p>"An impossible port that impresses"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>December has gotten off to quite the start, hasn't it? With so many new games launching on Switch 2, we're sure that you're keen to find out how each and every one of them runs on the fresh hardware and, as ever, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2U5h4_MqXaU">Digital Foundry</a> are here to do just that.</p>
<p>This time, it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' Switch 2 port that's being put under the microscope. The above video sets a baseline of the Xbox Series S version and compares the technical flair of the new Nintendo hybrid from there. So, what does DF make of it?</p>
<p>Visually, the Switch 2 has some obvious cutbacks from the Series S edition. Without SSR, the handheld version is lacking most water reflection and movement, and you'll notice some decrease in foliage at a middle distance. Textures also come in at a decreased resolution, and, ironically, the titular shadows don't hold up as well as they do elsewhere — though, at half the storage size of the Series S release, this is hardly surprising.</p>
<p>All that said, DF describes the Switch 2 edition as "a pretty handsome rendition of the game", one that comes in very close to the Series S.</p>
<p>In terms of image quality, the game utilises DLSS technology to help along the docked mode's typical 648p resolution, and produces a much better image than that number would suggest in the process. This is, of course, reduced in handheld play, where DF counted resolutions as low as 400p, but it all remains "pretty respectable" in action and is even considered "more reliable in portable play than when docked".</p>
<p>The game mostly sticks to its 30fps target in typical play, though its frame pacing is rather poor, and there are occasional dips in particularly taxing locations or cutscenes.</p>
<p>All in all, DF considers Shadows on Switch 2 as "an impossible port that impresses", something we firmly agreed with in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">our 8/10 review</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Survival RPG Echoes of Elysium Gets Last-Minute Early Access Delay to January 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-gets-last-minute-early-access-delay-to-january-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent developer Loric Games announced the last-minute delay of the early access debut of its upcoming survival roleplaying game, Echoes of Elysium. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-early-access-release-date-loric-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was supposed to launch today</a>, but the developers ultimately decided it was not ready and decided to postpone the debut to next month so that they may fix the 'stubborn bugs'.</p>



<p><a href="https://youtu.be/Qih_8SwonFU?si=rz9bH_uYUB0-TweH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a video announcement</a>, Loric Games CEO Brian Johnson stated:</p>



<p><em>We've built something genuinely awesome and unique, and we don't want to spoil that with a couple of stupid crash bugs. We're incredibly proud of what we've created, and even more excited to keep building on it with our community. I want to first thank the entire Loric team for the insanely hard work everyone has put in. I also want to thank our community, creators, press, and testers for all the support so far. It's not just us over here grinding—it's an entire community helping bring this game to life. We have big plans for this game. Please be patient with us as we continue to pour our heart and soul into this world</em>.</p>



<p>We were invited to a remote press presentation ahead of the originally planned December 4 debut, where we learned more about the game. Echoes of Elysium centers on customizable airships, which are vital for exploration, combat, and resource harvesting as players navigate the bright, colorful world made of floating islands that the developers have consciously crafted to move away from the dark, dreary survival game tropes. </p>



<p>The game takes place in the titular Elysium, a shattered paradise in the heavens of mythic Greece, filled with soul‑powered clockwork beasts and a hostile faction known as the Heron Armada. The player character is a hero guided by the goddess Lethe, tasked with uncovering Elysium's past and resisting the Armada in an open‑world, story‑driven sandbox that is procedurally generated. Upcoming biomes include storm-heavy cloud areas with 3D mesh clouds and caves, allowing varied exploration.</p>



<p>Airship construction is fully modular. Players design layouts, place functional modules, weapons, engines, sails, and defenses, then pilot the ship in real time. It is possible to eventually field a small fleet rather than just a single vessel. Combat pits players against waves of flying mechanical enemies, fortified sky‑towers, and Heron warships, with upgrades and new parts needed to survive greater threats. The airships can be augmented through craftable statues, granting abilities like stealth or rapid transition between regions. They can suffer damage and be repaired or destroyed. Beware that friendly fire is enabled. </p>



<p>Combat isn't limited to the airship. Loric Games plans to offer a mix of ground-based and ship-based combat, with the goal of achieving roughly equal emphasis. Players can also customize their characters with archetypes such as warriors, pilots, and engineers, each impacting the gameplay style.</p>



<p>The core gameplay loop combines elements of survival and RPG systems. Players gather resources on islands, craft tools, weapons, armor, and ship components, and use them to push deeper into more dangerous biomes. But progression also comes from leveling the character, unlocking abilities, and upgrading gear. Echoes of Elysium supports solo play or online co‑op for up to six players, and all major activities, such as exploration, building, boss fights, and resource runs, are designed to scale and feel better with a crew sharing roles aboard one or more ships.</p>



<p>Beyond the airship, the game also features fun glider-empowered traversal. The developers claimed that the community's input was crucial to making it feel smooth and dynamic. Following the early access debut, Loric plans to introduce ranged weapons, grappling hooks for ship-to-ship combat, enhanced shipbuilding, and new biomes. Improvements to progression systems, character customization, and ship combat mechanics are also planned, not to mention more modes. Offline support may be added based on feedback, but the team believes that multiplayer co-op is where their game shines best.</p>

<p>Following the presentation, we were able to ask a couple of questions to CEO Brian Johnson. For a hands-on preview of Echoes of Elysium, <a href="https://wccftech.com/echoes-of-elysium-hands-on-preview-the-skys-the-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out David's earlier article</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Several people at Loric Games are MMO veterans. Is there anything that you're able to use from your experience in that genre in Echoes of Elysium, even though it is a somewhat different genre?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brian Johnson:</strong> You're right. The studio was founded by ex Mythic Entertainment folks, myself included. And then we've also added a fair number of people from Bethesda. I think actually the origins about why we chose to build a co-op game instead of a giant MMO kind of stems from COVID. We have people who have worked on games like Worm Online and Star Wars: The Old Republic and Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76. The challenge we came up with is that it became this, like, forever dream that we kept chasing. How many people can we jam into a region? And so we just kept doing that and it was fun. There's some definite technical challenges to it. But when I played Valheim with a couple of my friends during COVID, I remembered what I loved about playing online games.</p>



<p>I liked playing with my small group of friends. I liked playing in a world that I owned. Almost going back to when we used to play Quake a long time ago and we'd host servers and play people would join those. So, that was what drove us forward. Then we thought to ourselves, well, what can we use from our MMO days that really drives that and and what can we borrow from it? </p>



<p>One of the big things you're going to see is our content pipeline. In MMOs, doing regular updates is an important part of the experience and getting content to the game and making that content systemic in some cases. That's very much where we're going to be bringing to life here. So, we started with a platform first. We're a venture-backed game studio. So, we've been really focused on developing a platform that allows us to bring a lot of both narrative content, creative content, and new systems online rapidly post early access as we learn what our players do and don't want in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Is there some sort of endgame that you may be adding to Echoes of Elysium?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brian Johnson:</strong> Man, this is a funny thing. The answer is absolutely, and that might come in the form of PVP. um that might come in less of forms, but we do very much want to get to a place where you're in this sandbox, you're surviving your friends, and you could sort of continue to create the world and change the world the way you want to. We've even experimented with being able to use harpoon weapons to drag other ships, even islands around, and we're really excited about exploring that and seeing where it takes us.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-se-3-gets-cleared-out-at-all-time-low-practically-renewed-level-pricing-for-its-latest-smartwatch-2000650254</link>
            <guid>1372798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even Black Friday and Cyber Week deals tend to give the greatest discounts to the one-gen-behind tech devices while keeping the markdowns on the newest releases far more modest. And when a brand-new device does get a big splashy deal, it’s almost always shortlived.</p>
<p>Yet here we are nearly a week after Black Friday, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">one of Apple’s newest smartwatches is still sitting under $200 at Amazon</a>. That’s the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3, which is still $50 below its usual price despite being barely three months old. There’s no catch, no hidden “refurbished” language, or anything else that would give you pause before cashing in and upgrading your exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and overall smartwatch game for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Upgrade or Starter</h2>
<p>At $200 and with the sturdy construction that Apple puts into all of its smartwatches, the Apple Watch SE 3 is in a unique position where it can be either an upgraded watch for someone with an older model, or an ideal first smartwatch for a younger user. The Apple Watch For Your Kids feature is easily set up on the SE 3, and it lets the wearer call, text, and share their location even if they don’t have an iPhone. They’ll benefit from the all-day 18-hour battery life and rapid recharging just as much as adult wearers, if not more.</p>
<p>As an upgrade on an older smartwatch, the SE 3 brings a wide array of advanced features, most notably in the health and sleep monitoring and tracking departments. The SE 3 monitors the quality and duration of your sleep and gives you an overall sleep score so you can work to maintain or improve it. The smartwatch also gives you alerts if it detects possible sleep apnea, which could give you early detection of a potentially life-threatening condition and allow you to seek treatment.</p>
<p>All of the workout tracking, activity rings, seamless sync of data with an iPhone, and other advanced features that have established the Apple Watch as one of the preeminent health-oriented smartwatches on the market, are present in the SE 3, and in their most recent and advanced forms.</p>



<h2>Easy to See</h2>
<p>The many great features and visuals of the Apple Watch SE 3 are always at the ready, thanks to the 1,000 nits of brightness that come from the OLED Retina display. It also now features Always-On display mode, so you can look down at any time during your workout or run and see your running pace or heart rate, or your text messages and incoming calls.</p>
<p>The 40mm GPS model of the Apple Watch SE 3 continues to defy convention during the holiday shopping season, first by getting a fat $50 price break, and now by keeping it well past Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">This 20% off deal at Amazon is still going strong, but who knows for how long?</a></p>

<p>High on Life 2 has just received a brand new gameplay showcase, revealing early parts of the title’s campaign. </p>



<p>The sequel to the popular Squanch Games was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-one-life-2-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-with-release-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed earlier this year</a> during the Xbox Showcase at the Summer Game Fest, with a release date set for February 2026. What’s more, the game is set to release on PlayStation 5, along with Xbox Series X/S and PC at launch. Now, let’s check out the title’s early campaign gameplay below. </p>







<h2 id="h-high-on-life-2-campaign-gameplay-reveals-pinkline-harbor-hub">High On Life 2 Campaign Gameplay Reveals Pinkline Harbor Hub</h2>



<p>The new High on Life 2 campaign gameplay comes through a new video posted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vpw9qg_AaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> on YouTube. It showcases Pinkline Harbor, one of the three in-game hubs players will encounter earlier in the game. The latest video starts with the player meeting two guards while holding the same guns we saw in the previous gameplay trailer. The conversation options differ depending on the weapons they have, with each gun providing a response that suits their personality. </p>



<p>We then see the player character explore the Pinkline Harbor, grinding some rails on their skateboard, even receiving a new one from one of their newly made allies. The video also includes a side mission in which the player saves one of the NPCs from drowning with their suction weapon. The player then proceeds to grind rails and jump across roofs in the city with their skateboard, taking down one of the wanted posters of them in the process. </p>



<p>The High On Life 2 campaign gameplay ends when the player reaches the destination for the primary mission, Pinkbellies Bar and Grill. However, to get this location, we see the player find and use two Lugblobs to open the door. Interested readers can check out the new trailer below: </p>

            <p>
Skyblivion - the ambitious, highly anticipated mod remaking the entirety of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion using Skyrim's engine - won't hit its originally anticipated 2025 release, its development team has confirmed, with the project now expected next year.
</p>
<p>
Developer TESRenewal originally announced its 2025 release target back in 2023, but in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc">new update video</a>, project lead Rebelzize confirmed the delay, explained the team still has "some last challenges to overcome that are going to require a little bit more time."
</p>
<p>
"This is something we have known for a while," he continued, "but we did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project." To that end, the remainder of the eight-and-a-half-minute video takes a closer look at its current state, with Rebelzize stressing many parts are now "in great shape".
</p>

</div><figcaption>Will Skyblivion really be better than Oblivion Remastered?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmspR2xIL38" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Skyblivion's world map is "100 percent finished", for instance, and the team has <a href="https://skyblivion.com/">uploaded an interactive satellite version of the map</a> for closer perusal. Similarly, all quest dungeons, which have been remade for the project, are complete, while the remaining random dungeons are "mostly finished".
</p><p>
As for other key elements, interiors for houses, shops, castles, stables, inns, and chapels are complete, but there's still some work to be done on the Imperial City before they can all find a home. It sounds like the Imperial City - which is still awaiting final assets - is the last major roadblock as far as locations go. Other cities are complete and the studio believes it'll have all locations wrapped up and ready to go by the end of this year, at which point it can focus on quest finalisation, navmesh work, and QA as 2026 gets underway.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, weapons, armour, clothing, plants, clutter, and the majority of architecture assets are complete, meaning 3D modelling work is virtually done, leaving a few low priority assets to go. Additionally, UI work continues, with the team transitioning to a more Skyrim-like interface, and the mechanics team is said to be making "solid progress" as it focuses on enhancing player experience, based on feedback from the team. Most major systems are anticipated to be complete by the end of the year, and the goal is to open Skyblivion out for wider play-testing at a later date. The team has, however, hit a snag with cinematics, and is seeking volunteers to finish a major scene.
</p>
<p>
Once major work is complete, Rebelzize says the goal is to spend "as much time as possible polishing, balancing, and fixing" ready for launch day. And that work will likely continue after release, as it addresses issues spotted by players once they get their hands on the game. Additionally, there are robust plans for post-release updates, with the team hoping to implement custom content, original Oblivion DLC such as Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine, and other features - including spell crafting, Oblivion-like UI reskins, dynamic dungeons, grave robbing, increased creature variety, followers and hirelings, more unique weapons and armours, additional unique spells, and more.
</p>
<p>
One previously discussed element that won't make release is underwater combat. Despite getting the feature "partially working", the team opted to drop it due to conflicts with animation mods and other technical issues. There is, however, still hope it can be revisited and added at a later date. 
</p><p>
"We thank you all for your continued support of this ambitious project I started more than ten years ago," Rebelzize concludes. "And I really, genuinely cannot wait to get Skyblivion into your hands". Following today's delay announcement, the mod is expected to launch sometime next year.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/io-interactive-shares-lots-of-gameplay-details-in-007-first-light-dev-diary</link>
            <guid>1372789</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>IO Interactive is in our good books big time off the back of all the premium-grade assassinating they've let us do across the globe as Agent 47. Now the team has taken up the mantle (the obvious next step for those paying attention) of James Bond himself, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007: First Light</a>.</p>
<p>And ahead of the game's <strong>27th March 2026</strong> release date, IO has dropped the very first in a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rL2hzHtdW38">dev diary deep dives</a> aimed at exploring this latest Bond adventure alongside interested players. What an absolute high this dev team has been on with the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and it looks like it'll continue here.</p>
<p>We've already seen <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/007-first-light-is-more-than-just-spies-and-style-launches-march-2026-on-switch-2">bits and pieces of the game</a>, and we know it's a reimagining of the Bond origin story, featuring a young 007. But this first episode, which you can watch in full above, concentrates on gameplay, as the series as a whole looks to cover the design philosophy and creative processes.</p>

<p>It's interesting stuff, so make sure to check it out for all the new gameplay footage, and discussions about the game's blend of mechanics, which it seems will - in part at least - run with some <strong>Hitman</strong> aspects, developing on stuff such as questioning and observing, and blending into your surroundings. Oh boy, we can't wait.</p>
<p>One example mentioned in the video is "enforcers", meaning NPCs who see through you because they "know" everyone who works in a particular building or area. So this then introduces a new puzzle style to work with.</p>
<p>We also get some tantalising chat about how the devs want to balance thing to give players freedom to approach any situation the way they want as Bond, whilst also making it so the execution of any given plan you hatch can go wildly wrong and need re-tuning on the fly. All the good stuff we hoped we'd hear them speak about when approaching James Bond in their signature style, basically.</p>
<p>Andreas Krogh, the gameplay director on 007: First Light also mentions new techniques they've come up with by "marrying" Bond's style with their take on stealth. So you have some new deescalation options, such as bluffing. Here we see that Bond can smooth talk his way out of a scenario where the only option for 47 would be to pan somebody in the head or run away.</p>

<p>Thomas Pulluelo, the game's level designer, also pops up to show how the rather nice looking environs on display are designed so that players can see opportunities more easily and naturally. So hopefully fewer shiny pipes and yellow footholds, and more feeling like you did it all yourself. Nice.</p>
<p>There's are some fantastic sequences (so do make sure to check out the full vid) that show off the amazingly brutal action and combat we can expect in March of next year. This young Bond does some vicious CQC, he charges down foes and gets stuck in like a proper trained killer. Expect plenty of quick switching between fist fights, shooting with fancy guns, stealth action and lots of crashing of expensive cars and then reloading the game.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of cars, where did we put the keys to our motor? It's been leaking oil slicks and randomly firing machine gun bullets out of its hood again. Honestly, Q's been right off their game recently.</p>
<p>If you're looking forward to 007: First Light, make sure you check out <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/previews/why-007-first-light-is-the-most-exciting-game-of-2026">Push Square's preview</a> from back in September; they might be more excited than us!</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to 007: First Light? Think IO's style suits 007 down to the ground like we do? Let us know!</em></p>

<figcaption><em>The God Slayer </em>probably isn't what you're used to from Pathea Games.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page, <em>The God Slayer </em>features a rather nifty elemental system in which the elements will interact with each other in realistic ways; fire, for instance, will burn wood, while steam will rise from boiling water and earth can block your path.</p><p>As an Elemancer, you'll be able to use the elements to your advantage in combat; the gameplay trailer (thanks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhiXXsDsWTg" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>) shows the player using ice to freeze human enemies after an alleyway has been flooded with water, as well as using rock magic to hurl stones at encroaching demonic enemies.</p><p>Of course, we're likely a while away from <em>The God Slayer</em>'s release; it doesn't have an official release date yet, so what we're seeing in these trailers could be fairly heavily choreographed to show the game at its best.</p><p>Still, if you want to get a sense for <em>The God Slayer</em>'s setting and vibe, you can check out the debut CG trailer right here.</p>
<p>As well as <em>The God Slayer</em>, Pathea is also hard at work on upcoming cozy life sim <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba8c6a72-2d0f-4000-bc5a-2dc8cdc24ff3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">skipping Early Access</a> after its Kickstarter managed to raise over $2.5 million dollars late last year.</p><p>You can wishlist Pathea Games' <em>The God Slayer </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536510/The_God_Slayer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a> to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Failed to Clear Racing Wheel at Black Friday, Now Liquidating Stock at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-failed-to-clear-racing-wheel-at-black-friday-now-liquidating-stock-at-record-low-2000650485</link>
            <guid>1372783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/">Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333</a>.</p>
<p>This is a g<strong>reat gift for people who love racing games</strong> or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The <em>TrueForce</em> force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How TrueForce Makes Sim Racing More Fun</h2>
<p>The<strong> G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second</strong> to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.</p>



<p>The <strong>wheel can turn 900 degrees</strong> which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.</p>
<p>The <strong>pedal set has a progressive brake spring</strong> that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.</p>



<p>The <strong>separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great</strong> by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.</p>
<p>You can <strong>use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac</strong> so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.</p>
<p>This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 2025 B-Series Soundbar Is Now Cheaper Than Budget Earbuds as It Still Holds Its Black Friday Low Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-b-series-soundbar-2025-black-friday-low-cheaper-than-budget-earbuds-2000650185</link>
            <guid>1372777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV’s internal speakers don’t offer an immersive sound experience and you’re done rewinding content just to hear what was said, it’s high time you invest in a solid soundbar. The best options out there push audio that surrounds you, plus offer multiple listening modes for different needs, and now is a great time to nab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">The latest Samsung B-Series soundbar, which comes with a built-in subwoofer, is currently down to just $100 at Amazon, after a nice 29% discount.</a> You’re saving a nice $40 on it, and it’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while. Pick yours up fast, because such discounts don’t last forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>This compact soundbar sits nicely on the console of your TV and is minimal enough to blend into any entertainment setup. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can mount it on the wall just as well. It connects to your display (or other devices) using Bluetooth, so there are no cables or complicated steps to worry about. Once connected, it pushes bold, room-filling sound that surrounds you. It won’t feel like the audio is just being blasted from the speaker, but instead, coming from all corners and every direction. The included subwoofer takes care of the bass, bringing action-packed scenes and even your favorite tunes to life. Watching a classic action movie? You’ll feel like the fights are happening right there in your living room. Planning a horror show night? Be ready for footsteps creeping up from behind, and don’t blame us if the entire thing feels a lot more spookier!</p>
<p>Dialogues get a boost, too. It does a good job of picking up on everything that’s being said, from screams in the Real Housewives to subtle whispers in the Stranger Things. You won’t have to rewind a scene repeatedly anymore. Moreover, sound doesn’t distort at higher levels, which is great for when you’re using the soundbar to vibe to your favorite songs. There’s also a Do Not Disturb mode built right in, which automatically reduces the volume. This is one ideal for those late-night streaming sessions where you don’t want to wake the entire house up.</p>



<p>Setting things up is straightforward, and managing everything is even simpler. The soundbar can be used with your Samsung TV remote, letting you adjust power, volume, and sound effects easily. To get started, put the soundbar in the pairing mode using the input button on it. Then, turn your TV on and head to Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Sound Output &gt; Bluetooth Speaker List. Look for your soundbar in the list, and press Pair and Connect. It should be ready to use within a few minutes! All in all, if you’ve been wanting to grab a solid Bluetooth soundbar to enjoy better sound during your favorite movies and series but couldn’t pick one up during Black Friday, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">This option would normally run you around $140, but you can grab it for just $100 today</a>. You’ll also enjoy free delivery with your purchase. Just note that it’s selling out fast, so the discount, as well as the stock, won’t be around for long. Snap it up quick, because once the deal is gone, it might not come back anytime soon.</p>

<p>If you thought the Skill-Based Matchmaking conversation was going anywhere, you might want to boil the kettle. Not only is Treyarch adamant about having SBMM, but Black Ops 7’s playlist options will now feature SBMM modes more prominently.</p>



<p>The letters ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-sbmm-cod-creator-debunk-conspiracies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a>‘ will forever be synonymous with FPS games. Skill-based matchmaking plays a huge role in modern-day matchmaking, and there was a lot of interest around Black Ops 7 after Treyarch revealed that it would feature a greater emphasis on ‘Open Matchmaking.’</p>



<p>Slowly but surely, the developer might be backtracking.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Was it always going to happen? Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Since launch, the Standard Matchmaking playlist option—which emphasizes SBMM—has been a regular playlist option. This will change with Black Ops 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-patch-notes-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 patch notes</a> have revealed some interesting notes on SBMM:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve continued to see increased engagement with Standard Moshpit, so we’ll be featuring it in the Featured tab for players who prefer an experience with more similarly skilled opponents. With the main tab changing to Featured, the other tab will now become Party Games, which will include Prop Hunt, Sharpshooter, One in the Chamber, and Gunfight at the launch of Season 01, as well as the debut of Sticks &amp; Stones and Gun Game in Week 2.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In layman’s terms, players are apparently playing modes that prioritize SBMM for matchmaking. This is more player engagement here; therefore, Treyarch is now rewarding this by adding Standard Moshpit to the featured playlist—making it a center-stage attraction.</p>



<p>There have been suggestions that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-findings-show-sbmm-might-not-be-as-open-as-advertised/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM might not be as open as advertised</a> in Black Ops 7. This ‘Featured’ move doesn’t necessarily support this theory, but it shows that SBMM is becoming prevalent in Call of Duty once again.</p>



<p>Is this Treyarch u-turning on the idea of moving Black Ops 7 more toward open matchmaking? If you have thoughts on this or SBMM in general, head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> for more gaming conversations.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Death Ball monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Gems, Crystals, Cosmic Orbs and much more.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of intense anime-style battles and the popular gym class game dodgeball, then you need to check out Death Ball immediately. Death Ball is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sols-rng-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> dodgeball game where players use an energy ball instead of a traditional ball. This is done not by throwing the ball as would usually be the case, but by using various abilities and movement skills. Players must try to parry the ball in order to hit an opponent instead of trying to catch it, as each hit and change of direction increases the speed and power of the ball.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Players initially queue into a massive arena with multiple other players, where the main objective is to be the last player standing after all of the competitors have been eliminated. The game also tends to get harder and harder as it progresses into the latest stages, making things like timing, reactions and general positioning that much more important. With a variety of Champions to choose from, each with varied abilities, Death Ball can offer hours of entertainment. Stronger weapons and Champions can be unlocked using the in-game currencies, and one way to get more of them is by using the following Death Ball codes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-death-ball-codes">How To Get More Death Ball Codes</h2>



<p>Death Ball codes are usually released either through the game’s official Discord server or through the Roblox game page. However, tracking both of these regularly can be a hassle, and moreover, they never notify the players when any of the previously released codes expire. That’s why we recommend that all players keep this page bookmarked, as we update the article as soon as any new codes drop, while expired codes are also promptly removed from the active codes list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

But that's not part of Ubisoft's plans, according to the Prince of Persia account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The official social media channel poured cold water on a fan account speculating that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will show up at The Game Awards on December 11. "Sorry to disappoint but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at [The Game Awards] this year," the Prince of Persia account states.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖</p>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In June, Ubisoft noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-once-again-promises-that-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-on-the-way/1100-6532466/">the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31</a>--the end of the company's current fiscal year.

            <title><![CDATA[Three Days After Cyber Monday, Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights (200ft, 120 LEDs) Still at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/three-days-after-cyber-monday-govee-permanent-outdoor-lights-200ft-120-leds-still-at-record-low-2000650481</link>
            <guid>1372735</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In December, holiday lights look great but being able to use them all year long gives you a lot more options for your outdoor space. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money on Philips Hue’s outdoor system, Govee has a cheaper option that works just as well and has the same features. For instance, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">the<em> Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> kit is now $459 instead of the usual $759 which is still the lowest price ever</a>, even three days after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales were supposed to end.</p>
<p>This 200-foot system with <strong>120 individually addressable LED lights</strong> solves the problem of having to put up and take down seasonal decorations all the time. It also gives you <strong>professional-looking accent lighting</strong> every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Lights Are Good for More Than Just Holidays</h2>
<p>The new lens design makes a t<strong>riangular lighting effect that spreads out the glow i</strong>nstead of making harsh point sources whcih means that your house looks lit up instead of just having bright spots. Each LED can produce up to 50 lumens and works with <strong>color temperatures from 2700K warm white to 6500K cool white</strong> which means you can use them for everyday outdoor lighting, not just for special occasions. With <strong>the RGBWWIC feature, you can control red, green, blue, white, warm white, and separate chips</strong> and it lets you make color gradients and animations that go all the way across the installation.</p>



<p>You can change the layout to fit your roofline or other architectural features because the design can be cut and extended, and you don’t have to stick with set lengths. You can cut the strand at certain points and <strong>reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet</strong>: This lets you go around corners, dormers, and other things. The<strong> whole system can handle up to 200 feet of lights</strong> so you can light up a big house or put together lights on different sides of your building.</p>
<p>Using the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach to your eaves or fascia, it takes about eight seconds to install each light. The lights are 2 to 4 inches away from the wall which gives them that professional floating look instead of sitting flush against the building. The <strong>IP67</strong> rating on both the lights and the adapter means that rain, snow, and sprinkler systems won’t hurt the electronics, and the IP65 control box can be mounted outside without needing extra weatherproofing. These<strong> lights can work in temperatures ranging from -4°F to 140°F</strong>&nbsp;so they can handle everything from harsh winter weather to hot summer weather without losing any performance.</p>



<p><strong>Matter, Alexa, and Google Assistant</strong> all work with smart home integration, so you can control the whole system with your voice without having to take out your phone. You can control each LED separately with the Govee Home app which means you can make your own patterns that draw attention to certain architectural features or move in ways that fit your design vision. There are <strong>75 pre-set scene modes in the app for holidays, seasons, and general ambiance</strong> so you can switch from patriotic red, white, and blue to spooky Halloween orange and purple without having to program anything yourself. The l<strong>ights will last for about 17 years of daily use</strong> at three hours per day, which means they will probably last longer than you do in the house.</p>
<p>This $300 off makes permanent outdoor lighting competitive with buying good temporary Christmas lights every few years. For less than the cost of high-end single-color strip lighting, you get individual LED control, weather resistance, and the ability to connect to a smart home. If you’ve been thinking about getting permanent outdoor lighting but couldn’t justify the cost of Philips Hue, the Govee system is on sale for the lowest price ever and has similar features for about 40% of the price.</p>
