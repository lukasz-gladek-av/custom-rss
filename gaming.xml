            <p>In a change to a previous statement, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> says it will be "reprinting" Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition on PS5 physical disc after all.</p>
<p>Last week, Annapurna announced there had "been a glitch in the time loop", and the PS5 physical edition of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-physical-editions-of-outer-wilds-archaeologist-edition-have-the-wrong-version-of-the-game-on-them">Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition had been printed with "the wrong version of the game"</a>, and the Echoes of the Eye expansion was unknowingly omitted from the disc.</p>
<p>In recompense, the company invited players to contact iam8bit's customer support team with proof of purchase to receive a DLC voucher code, which - as some collectors pointed out - nullified the point of owning a physical copy of the game in the first place.</p>

<p>Annapurna has apologised to fans again and says it is "striving to deliver physical editions that honour and quality and craft of their games".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X/Twitter, the company said in additional to its previous plan to offer a digital voucher for the missing DLC, it was now also offering fans the chance to return their discs for the complete edition.</p>
<p>"We will be reprinting the Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition for PS5 with the Echoes of the Eye expansion complete on disc," the team explained.</p>
<p>"If you do NOT want a digital resolution, we advise you to return your physical edition to the retailer from which it was purchased as soon as possible (or cancel your order if you haven't yet received it)."</p>
<p>From next week, Annapurna says players can place "a new order for a corrected physical copy of Outer Wilds: Archaeologist Edition directly from a partnering online storefront".</p> <div>

<p>"Due to the complicated nature of global retail distribution, this is the best way to ensure you can receive the version of the game we intended to release. Please note that production of the corrected version of the game will take around eight weeks."</p>
<p>Annapurna once again apologised, saying:</p>
<p>"Our partners at iam8bit are committed to the preservation of games in a physical format and strive to deliver physical editions that honour the quality and craft of their games.</p>
<p>"We deeply regret this error and apologise to you - our fans and customers - for the frustrating nature of this release. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to make this right."</p>

Well, almost everything. The neat thing about summer is that it’s prime time for deals on video games,, and this narrow window between the end of summer vacation and the actual beginning of autumn is the last bit of time for stores to squeeze some sales out before the heavy-hitting releases of the year start dropping every other week.

A certain fashion trend, a popular artist, or a movie that most everyone has seen. They also have their own signature games, and even consoles. For example, my generation had quite a few great systems growing up, but none was ever more popular than the PlayStation 2, and few games were as beloved as its RPGs. It was, perhaps, the single greatest console for the genre, and many of its hits are still as acclaimed to this day, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-final-fantasy-games-rpg-7-6-10-12-square-enix-ff-1850560934&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-final-fantasy-games-rpg-7-6-10-12-square-enix-ff-1850560934">numerous <em>Final Fantasy </em>games</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early development gameplay from 2022 of the Crazy Taxi reboot has been leaked online showcasing its multiplayer elements.</p>



<p>The new leaked footage comes courtesy of X (formerly Twitter) user <a href="https://x.com/ryanfrombronx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ryanfrombronx</a>, who uploaded the 33-second clip to his profile. According to Ryan, the footage is early development footage that was captured in 2022. You can see the gameplay below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ryan continues to say in the thread that the game is coming to “all modern platforms and the successor to the current Nintendo Switch in 2027”. This means that the Crazy Taxi reboot will be coming to the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, SEGA confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-new-crazy-taxi-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crazy Taxi will be an open-world multiplayer game</a>. The development team had difficulty pivoting from a single-player experience to a live-service multiplayer model, but the game is now progressing very well. Previously, Midori, who was an account created by Ryan, has claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crazy-taxi-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crazy Taxi reboot is being developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>SEGA announced <span>in December 2023 that it was developing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-announces-five-new-games-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five new games:</a>&nbsp;Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, and Crazy Taxi. Insider Gaming understands that more classic games are being developed and&nbsp;</span>revived.</p>

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Final Fantasy XVI, and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-i-ii-iii-the-power-of-nostalgia/"> Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters</a> are on the docket for Xbox consoles, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zEasbCMi2rI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Two podcast</a>, Windows Central's Jez Corden commented on the Square Enix series and the possibility of the latest entries getting released on Xbox consoles, saying that he has heard that the whole slate is on the docket. As for when they are going to be released, Corden could not say, although he thinks that something related to the series will be revealed during Microsoft's event at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Additionally, he heard that the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy hasn't been locked down by Sony, so it will come to Xbox at some point, though when it is not yet known. Given how the series is still incomplete, Square Enix will likely wait until the third and final entry in the trilogy is out before porting to Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Tokyo Game Show | Xbox and Capcom Deal | Concord Disaster - XB2 330" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zEasbCMi2rI?start=4058&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Given the current state of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, it's extremely likely that Final Fantasy XVI will be the next entry in the series to launch on Xbox consoles following the launch of Final Fantasy XIV earlier this year. Seeing how the game doesn't run particularly well on the more powerful PlayStation 5, it will be very interesting to see how Square Enix handles the Xbox Series S version.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy is Rebirth, released earlier this year on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"> review.</a></p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Now then, what have you all been playing?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Andrewww’s</strong> had a stressful week, but thankfully found some time for some gaming with Horizon Forbidden West. Unfortunately, that included the anxiety inducing size of the game, so after 30 hours in, he’s only 33% completed, and it’s leaving PS Plus soon!</li>
<li>And <strong>MrYd</strong> has played mostly Diablo 4 and Balatro of late, before this week’s appearance of Vampire Survivors on PlayStation, which has been a lot of fun so far. Oh, and he met Sir Ian Livingstone of Fighting Fantasy fame at work!</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s the round up for this week. Keep dry and warm, Keep your eyes peeled for everything we’ll be churning out over the next few days and weeks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/new-skaven-warhammer-miniatures-review-rats-off-to-ya<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Skittering in from the darkest reaches of the Mortal Realms come the Skaven, terrible rat-men bent on causing mass chaos. We saw Skaven in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set">kick off to the new edition of <em>Age of Sigmar</em></a>, and now Games Workshop has sent along the Skaven Codex and a heap of new models for me to check out. I’ve got a lot to cover, so I’m trying out a new format here! Tell me what you think in the comments, and read on for my New Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> Miniatures Review.</p>
<h3><b>Acolyte Globadiers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acolyte-globadiers.jpg?itok=EBjfx4XZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acolyte-globadiers.jpg?itok=3AOls7Bf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Acolyte Globadiers do best:</strong> These Clan Skryre troops are great at thinning out a crowd with their Anti-Infantry Poisoned Wind Globes, which gain 1 extra Damage when attacking enemy units with 10 or more models.</p>
<p><strong>How to run them:</strong> Keep them close to other Clanrats to use their somewhat incongruous Hidden Weapon Team ability (which makes them invisible to enemies more than 13” away), but get them in the mix as crowd control. Consider further buffing their poison attack for max whittling down but beware, once they face off against smaller number units they lose their effectiveness pretty quickly.</p>
<h3><b>Arch-Warlock</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arch-warlock.jpg?itok=A5294yog 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arch-warlock.jpg?itok=2332FtQF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Arch-Warlock does best:</strong>&nbsp;Being a brute with decent melee weapon skills (and a Warpfire Gauntlet that can shoot in combat) who can <i>also</i> use 1 spell.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:&nbsp;</strong>I really think you just want to pair a bunch of these Arch-Warlock’s with your rats to help dish out some real damage and use their Overseers of the Enginecovens special ability to make it so nearby Skryre units don’t spend command points when using the ‘Covering Fire’ command. Pretty straightforward, honestly.</p>
<h3><b>Brood Terror</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brood-terror.jpg?itok=uxcW3t8L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brood-terror.jpg?itok=TUhT2_wM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Brood Terror does best:</strong>&nbsp;Looking absolutely, gleefully disgusting on the tabletop. Also... smashing opponents.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it: </strong>All jokes aside, this amalgam of rotting rat flesh can dish out extreme melee damage, and has a powerful 15” ranged Warpflame Scourger. Just plop it down anywhere and let it do real damage to your opponents.</p>
<h3><b>Doom-Flayers</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-flayers.jpg?itok=Unv0N0fG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-flayers.jpg?itok=d00UwpD0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Doom-Flayers do best:</strong> As you’d expect from a rat on a giant wheel, the Doom-Flayer is best at moving <i>fast</i> on the battlefield (with a 2d6+3” move speed).</p>
<p><strong>How to run them: </strong>For the Doom-Flayers, it’s all about the Charge. Cover the distance, slam into your foes with a charge for extra damage, and use their special ability after your charge to sneak in some mortal wounds! It’s the perfect on-the-go option!</p>
<h3><b>Krittok Foulblade</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krittok-foulblade.jpg?itok=gPL98C00 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krittok-foulblade.jpg?itok=CSDxnyqo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What Krittok Foulblade does best:</strong> Krittok, a unique Verminus hero, gains most of his power from his possessed dagger Dooming - and what he does best on the battlefield is… slice and chop his opponents with Doomfang!</p>
<p><strong>How to run him:</strong> Krittok has some nice buffering abilities for those around him, including beefing up the wound roles. But because he has such a nice melee weapon, you’ll want him close by (and protected by) other units of fodder.</p>
<h3><b>Master Moulder</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/master-moulder.jpg?itok=cdyx3SyH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/master-moulder.jpg?itok=T5Z5FncI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Master Moulder does best:</strong> Healing abominations - which makes sense, since they're the ones who made them.</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong> The Master Moulder truly runs best as a support system for your larger, more valuable and punishing Moulder units. If you run him (and I’m not sure you need to, to be honest), you’ll want him primarily healing and adding to other units’ charge values.</p>
<h3><b>Stormvermin</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stormvermin.jpg?itok=MtdKQVI1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stormvermin.jpg?itok=SUep-6pc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Stormvermin do best:</strong> Being slightly sturdier than Clanrats.</p>
<p><strong>How to run them:</strong> If you have the points in your army list, you would do well to swap in a few of units of Stormvermin, but know that these slightly more advanced Clanrats (better save at 4+, and 3 attacks instead of 2) won’t truly move the needle for your army.</p>
<h3><b>Vizzik Skour, Prophet of the Horned Rat</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vizzik.jpg?itok=Z7hdOD9H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vizzik.jpg?itok=1ohwyKBk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What&nbsp;Vizzik Skour, Prophet of the Horned Rat does best:</strong>&nbsp;What does the chief priest of the Horned Rat do best? Crazy prayers and special abilities that basically rip apart your foe! Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>How to run him:</strong> While his attacks and all his abilities are super strong, his special ability ‘Fissures in Reality’ punishes enemies for being locked in combat with him. So don’t be afraid, even though he’d be a big, expensive centerpiece in your army, to move in for the kill and start attacking your enemies head on. In essence, don’t be precious with Vizzik!</p>
<h3><b>Warlock Galvaneer</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warlock-galvaneer.jpg?itok=mSXOjP5D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warlock-galvaneer.jpg?itok=fVHrS3uD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the&nbsp;Warlock Galvaneer does best:</strong> Sparking off electrical damage that can bounce from foe to foe. Also, looking like he's absolutely shredding with that blaster of his!</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong>&nbsp;Pair him up with the classic Warpvolt Scourgers and the Galvaneer can actually buff the attacks of those models by overcharging their weapons with electricity (which is hilarious to imagine). But as mentioned above, where you really want this unit to shine is by dishing out heavy ranged damage, and then using their special ability ‘More-More Warpvolt Doom!’ (Lol) to chain lightning attacks to other nearby enemy units!</p>
<h3><b>Warp-Grinder</b></h3>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warp-grinder.jpg?itok=O9ngbHEk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warp-grinder.jpg?itok=Bz8P8fn4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><strong>What the Warp-Grinder does best:</strong> Popping onto the battlefield at moments most inopportune for your opponent!</p>
<p><strong>How to run it:</strong> This is <i>such</i> a cool concept for a model. Essentially, they’ve got a giant drill that can tear through the fabric of reality. During deployment, you set them and one other friendly non-Monster unit up “In the Tunnels Below” (aka in reserve). Then, later, they can pop up right next to an enemy unit! This is absolutely fantastic for catching your enemies off guard.</p>
<h2>New Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> Miniatures - Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Phew! Thanks for joining me on that sprint through ten new Skaven <em>Warhammer</em> models up for preorder this week from Games Workshop. What do I think of all of these? As you can maybe glean from a lot of my quick-looks above, I'm really enamored with a lot of these models. While some don't necessarily break the mold here, most are extremely varied in how they enhance your Skaven army.</p>

<p>In January 2023, Gaimin Gladiators issued a statement against Ubisoft’s management of the Rainbow Six Siege scene and pulled out of the ecosystem. It said that it had suffered from a ‘lack of info from Ubisoft’, and at the time, many other organisations dropped out of the running. </p>



<p>Now, Gaimin Gladiators is back after acquiring the former roster of Team Bliss, marking a return to the Rainbow Six scene after more than 21 months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-the-game">Back in the Game</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, Gaimin Gladiators revealed the signing of the former Team Bliss squad:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wettables</li>



<li>Fishoguy</li>



<li>Sageon</li>



<li>Brendo</li>



<li>Tuhan</li>
</ul>



<p>The organisation has also picked up Titan, Mingoran, and Golden in management and team coaching capacities.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Following an entry into Rainbow Six Siege in 2022, Gaimin Gladiators failed to make waves, and less than a year later, the organisation withdrew from the landscape. There are high hopes that the team can make something of this refreshed run, as Team Bliss has been infinitely more successful and has made it to the stage at the Six Invitational and several BLAST R6 Major events.</p>



<p>Most recently, the squad appeared at the Six Invitational in Sao Paolo and at the BLAST R6 MAnchester Major. They even took a spot in the competition at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>It was a long time coming, but it’s a shrewd time to break back into Rainbow Six Siege. This has been a brilliant year for the game’s competitive ecosystem, and thanks to constant backing by Ubisoft, the title continues to evolve positively. </p>

<p>The organising body behind Vietnam’s ‘VCS’ league has posted on social media regarding the sudden death of Nguyen ‘EGO’ Khanh Hoa. On September 5, the two-time champion died after suffering a heart attack at just 21 years of age. The former MVP-grade player represented Team Flash, CERBERUS, and Saigon Buffalo during his time in the League of Legends esports scene.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-rising-star">Rising Star</h2>



<p>Per EGO’s profile, the talented player started competing when he was just 17 years old, making a name for himself in Vietnam as a prodigy of sorts. In his first competitive split, EGO secured an MVP award and won a title in the VCS – the Vietnam Championship Series. He would go on to win again the following year, in 2021.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Despite a successful regional streak, EGO announced his retirement from competing in 2023, just four years after he debuted. It wasn’t made clear why he was retiring so early, and the decision came before he’d landed the chance to compete on an international stage.</p>



<p>This former Jungler will be remembered for his stellar in-game talents, which earned him a Rookie of the Split award in 2020. Our condolences go out to his friends and family at this difficult time.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/blizzard-odyssey-images-leak-online/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-blizzard%E2%80%99s-cancelled-survival-game-%E2%80%98odyssey%E2%80%99-leak-online.974619/</guid>

<p>In 2023, discussions surfaced regarding a developing survival game that Blizzard was working on. It was previously claimed that the game would resemble Everwild, took inspiration from Fable Legends, and was being compiled with the concept of it being a ‘fairytale survival game’.</p>



<p>Fast forward to January 2024, and Odyssey had been cancelled, with it being claimed that the studio was facing ‘insurmountable issues’ with the game engine that they’d been developing since 2017.</p>



<p>Now, images of the beleaguered, forgotten project have reportedly surfaced online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-best-we-ll-get">The Best We’ll Get</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://vk.com/wall-23323356_38723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VK.com</a>, a Russian social media site, a series of images were uploaded by a user who claimed they were of Project Odyssey, Blizzard’s failed survival game.</p>



<p>In the shots, we see a multiplayer-based game that’s easily recognisable as a ‘generic’ survival title. The player has a series of tools and weapons in their possession, they’re able to manage an inventory packed with resources and other items, and on a ‘status’ screen, we see elements like warmth, buffs and debuffs, food, and sleep levels. </p>



<p>It looks as though Project Odyssey would have been highly customisable, starting with the base character model and then working up through clothing, loadout, and skill points and levels. It would have had a ‘cartoony’ aesthetic not too dissimilar to Palworld, and judging from the UI, players would have been able to use a series of powers and abilities.</p>



<p>In the screenshots, we can also see what looks like a ‘killfeed’, suggesting that Odyssey would have had PvP elements. In one image, a player has died after being shot by another user, and they’re given the option to choose their respawn point, one of which is as far as ‘822 steps away’, suggesting that the map was a fair size.</p>



<p>They also lost their carried gear and some durability of equipped gear when they passed, which is another typical survival-MMO mechanic.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, <strong><a href="https://imgur.com/a/nm4OUE9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">these leaked images</a> </strong>are the closest we’ll ever get to Odyssey.</p>



<p>Do you think this would have been a good game?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-difficulty-settings/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-black-myth-wukong-have-difficulty-settings.974598/</guid>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong took the gaming space by storm and, honestly, much of the world. It’s one of the most successful video games to hail from China and does an exceptional job of unveiling Chinese mythology to the masses. Despite many claiming it’s not a Soulslike, it absolutely is a Soulslike. I’ll die on this hill. So, does Black Myth: Wukong have difficulty settings? Can you make the game easier or more challenging if you’d like?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-raise-or-lower-the-difficulty-in-black-myth-wukong">Can You Raise or Lower the Difficulty in Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no difficulty settings option in Black Myth: Wukong. The game doesn’t follow the traditional Easy, Medium, or Hard scale of game difficulty but utilizes its own internal difficulty settings to challenge players to an extraordinary experience. However, it follows the same gameplay style as Elden Ring or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. You can’t lower the difficulty to make life easier, but you can practice and repeat sections of the game to improve your skills. </p>



<p>Furthermore, as in Elden Ring, you can farm zones and enemies in Black Myth: Wukong to level up and make the game slightly more approachable, albeit still tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-hard-is-black-myth-wukong">How Hard is Black Myth: Wukong?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ll be frank: Black Myth: Wukong provides quite the challenge. If you’re an inexperienced Soulslike player, or if you were tricked by the many reviews that said the game isn’t Soulslike but is an “action RPG,” which is total bull, then you’re likely feeling the sting of the game’s difficulty. </p>



<p>There’s one boss in particular, in one of the early-game zones, by the name of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-1-billion-steam-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wandering Wight</a>. It’s one of the most infuriating boss fights for a new player, and he’s begging you to challenge him. But you’re not supposed to beat him on the first encounter. You’re meant to return at a later time. The game features numerous bosses similar to this one—a lot of optional boss fights.</p>



<p>If you’re not a fan of the Soulslike genre, especially if you grow weary or angry when you don’t progress quickly enough, then perhaps skip Black Myth: Wukong!</p>

<p>One of the best ways to progress in Black Myth: Wukong is to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-increase-max-health-in-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase your max health</a>. Doing so will allow you to survive encounters with less effort!</p>

<p>With so many people enjoying the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 beta gameplay, players with some computer know-how want to ensure their systems run the game as optimally as imaginable. With that said, here’s a look at the Black Ops 6 system requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-system-requirements">What Are the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 System Requirements?</h2>



<p>Besides the massive storage space requirements, the system requirements for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 don’t appear too egregious. With the backing of Activision and Microsoft, one would expect a highly optimized first-person shooter, and that’s often what we receive each year. Make any argument you want, but Call of Duty usually runs well on most systems at launch.</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 / Intel Core i5-6600</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 470</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i7-6700K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti/RTX 3060 / AMD Radeon RX 6600XT / Intel Arc A770</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>:  149 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-the-system-requirements-change-before-launch">Will the System Requirements Change Before Launch?</h2>



<p>While it’s unlikely that the game’s system requirements will change, especially considering so many of us are already enjoying the game during the beta, there’s still a slim chance. The studio could make behind-the-scenes improvements that optimize the core experience and reduce the hardware requirements. They could also include some files that bloat the storage space requirements.</p>



<p>It’s entirely up in the air whether the PC system requirements for Black Ops 6 will change, but I find it unlikely.</p>

<p>With Final Fantasy XVI finally coming to PC, we’re looking at the latest RPG from Square Enix—previously only available on PS5—and we’re impressed so far. It looks gorgeous, and the PC features appear worthy, but how are the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements? Can your system run the game successfully?</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-xvi-pc-system-requirements">Final Fantasy XVI PC System Requirements</h2>



<p>Overall, the Final Fantasy XVI system requirements don’t appear too egregious. That is, until you spot the storage requirements! This massive game will eat up your SSD in one big gulp, so hopefully, you have enough room to accommodate yet another extensive RPG!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 / Intel Core i5 8400</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 5700 / Intel Arc A580 / Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X / Intel Core i7-10700</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT / Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 170 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-does-final-fantasy-xvi-have-controller-support-on-pc">Does Final Fantasy XVI Have Controller Support on PC?</h2>



<p>When Final Fantasy XVI launches on PC on September 17, it will do so with complete controller support from the get-go. You can use a DualShock, DualSense, or an Xbox Series X|S controller—even a third-party controller you scored for a few bucks from Walmart—to play the RPG. </p>



<p>It’s probably best to play with a controller. After all, this is a console RPG designed for the PS5 and is now being ported over to the PC!</p>

Sony's troubled live service game didn't even last two weeks, failing to fill its beta and launching to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">tragically low concurrent count on Steam</a>. Ultimately it is estimated to have<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing"> only sold around 25,000 units</a>, which is extraordinarily low by first-party release standards.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Concord servers are now offline.</p><p>Thank you again to all the Freegunners who have joined us in the Concord galaxy. <a href="https://t.co/o1dTywrqUx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/o1dTywrqUx</a></p></div>— Concord (@PlayConcord) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayConcord/status/1832107824295629044?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l3bffz4jjx25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Bluesky</a>, Circana executive director Mat Piscatella called Concord's shutdown "unprecedented," nothing that even Anthem was the best-selling game of February 2019 and is still playable today. Asked how it compares to the likes of The Day Before and Crucible, two other games that were shuttered soon after release, Piscatella said that this "one reads differently to me than anything that's come before," describing it as being "soundly rejected" by players.</p><p>It makes Concord one of the most remarkable news stories of the year — a first party release that ultimately never had a chance.</p><h2>Does Concord have a future as a free-to-play game?</h2><p>Still, at least some fans are wondering if there's a future for Sony's shooter. Could Concord work as a free-to-play game? That's been one of the main questions on platforms like X/Twitter and Resetera as fans debate the path ahead for Sony. Even before Concord shut down, Forbes writer Paul Tassi called its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/28/free-to-play-concord-is-inevitable-but-will-it-change-things/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transition to free-to-play "inevitable,"</a> though wondered if it would change things. </p><p>There are certainly plenty of sticking points. The roster failed to resonate with fans, and the art style and writing has variously been described as a kind of off-brand Guardians of the Galaxy. There's also little in terms of innovation to differentiate Concord from other hero shooters. In a market flooded with live service games, success is increasingly a zero sum game, and Concord was on the wrong side of the divide.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable</p></div><p>Nevertheless, we found points to like about Concord. In our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review">review</a>, we described the competitive gameplay as "fantastic" and praised its map design. In its closing days, a collection of trophy hunters made a last second dash to try and grab what will soon be one of PlayStation's rarest Platinums, even going so far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown">throw themselves off cliffs to grind XP</a>.</p><p>So will it return? One <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-sales-ceasing-immediately-offering-refunds-to-all-customers-the-game-will-be-taken-offline-beginning-sept-6th-check-staff-post.970872/page-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resetera</a> user opines. "I'm guessing it'll probably end up going F2P and then quietly shuttered if it doesn't find an audience quickly. Doing that's going to be a hell of a task though as the game was designed around progress not being monetised. I feel terrible for Firewalk, all that time invested into what's apparently a pretty decent game to have this happen straight after launch. I have a horrible feeling that there's going to be some layoffs coming soon."</p><p>Piscatella, for his part, is uncertain. "On the one hand, the game and the IP were just so soundly rejected of it that one may think it unsalvageable. On the other hand, so few know about the game that perhaps it could be brought back with a different model and a significant refresh. I think this is an unprecedented situation, with all options on the table, so anyone's guess is probably as good as mine."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>What's next for Sony</h2><p>For what it's worth, Concord isn't completely finished. As we reported yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source">Concord is still set to appear in Secret Level</a>, the upcoming Prime Video anthology series by Tim Miller that also features the likes of God of War, Mega Man, and Warhammer 40K. While it seems unlikely that it will re-ignite interest in the property, it does represent at least one spark of life for the franchise.</p><p>The future of Firewalk Studios, for its part, is unclear. The studio behind Concord was established as part of ProbablyMonsters in 2018 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-acquires-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">acquired by PlayStation in 2023</a>. Design director Josh Hamrick <a href="https://x.com/Josh_Hamrick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted throughout the week</a>, thanking fans and signing off when the servers went down with "FREEGUNNER FOR LIFE."</p><p>At one point he wrote wistfully, "I started at Firewalk in the Spring of 2019. We were less than a dozen devs working shoulder to shoulder in a friend's attic."</p><p>Sony, meanwhile, has more free-to-play games on the way, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fairgame-is-the-first-game-from-jade-raymonds-haven-studios">Fairgame$</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Bungie's Marathon</a>. Marathon has already had its share of problems, at one point being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">forced to replace its director amid layoffs and other problems</a>. Little has been shown of Fairgame$ outside of a CG trailer, but GI.biz's Chris Dring recently said that he's been hearing positive buzz about the game. One way or another, the future of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">Sony's live service strategy is uncertain</a>, though PlayStation can claim at least one victory thanks to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">success of Helldivers 2</a> in the first part of the year (though it has also struggled of late).</p><p>For now, Sony can take comfort in Astro Bot, which is both single-player and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">receiving rave reviews</a>. As for whether Concord will ever get another chance of its own, we'll just have to see.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

Now, he’s built a crystal ball filled with shimmering, spinning volumetric light — and of course he’s playing <em>Doom</em> on it. </p><p>But not just any <em>Doom</em>. <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-voxel-project/addons/voxel-doom">Voxel Doom</a>, where every dot of the game’s graphics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel">lives in 3D space</a>, just like the dots of the volumetric display he’s created. </p><p>As he explains on YouTube, the physical illusion is fairly simple: “It’s like a hologram fan, but instead of spinning a 1D strip to make a 2D image, it spins a 2D panel to make a 3D image.” On his Mastodon, he breaks it down a bit more <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames/112597046453214197">with visual aids</a>: </p><p>Brown’s been working on this for over a year now: if I’m not mistaken, he introduced the project in August 2023 <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames/110948067275036967">by channeling his inner Doc Brown</a>, saying “If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits 300rpm you’re going to see some serious shit.” But he’s since discovered it needs to spin a good bit faster than that for a smooth image, particularly when he’s trying to film it. So keep your fingers away.</p><p>You can follow his progress <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ancientjames">on his Mastodon,</a> where he’s not <em>just</em> playing <em>Doom — </em>you can find volumetric lunar landers and skulls and dino heads, for example.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</a> has finally delivered fans of the Wizarding World a proper Quidditch sports game, and so it only makes sense that broom customization will be a major factor in the experience. Ideally, you'll be spending the entirety of every Quidditch match on one, after all. But every broom that's available to choose from has its pros and cons--there's no one-size-fits-all choice to be made here. To pick the best broom in Quidditch Champions for you, you'll have to figure out what works best for your style of play and the positions that your characters are playing.</p><h2>Best Broom in Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</h2><p dir="ltr">When you first get started with Quidditch Champions, you'll have three brooms by default: the <strong>Shooting Star</strong>, the <strong>Cleansweep</strong>, and the <strong>Comet</strong>. There are currently seven others available to unlock by various means, like completing challenges or buying the deluxe edition or progressing through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-season-1-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-5752/" data-ref-id="2900-5752">the seasonal rewards</a>. But you don't need to sweat those unlocks--the basic brooms have better stats, at least to begin with, so you don't need any of those others if you're just concerned with effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">Brooms have three main stat categories--speed, durability and agility--and each of the three basic brooms is good in two of those categories and poor in the third. The Comet has high agility and high durability but low speed. The Cleansweep has high agility and high speed but low durability. The Shooting Star has high speed and high durability but low agility. You can upgrade them using Moonstones, one of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-how-to-get-more-winged-keys/1100-6526307/" data-ref-id="1100-6526307">three main currencies</a>, but there's an opportunity cost involved in doing so because you upgrade each broom separately--if you blow all your Moonstones on Shooting Star, you won't have anything to upgrade your Comet.</p><p dir="ltr">But because of how the brooms are balanced, it's not ideal to simply pick one to put all your Moonstones into. You'll need to upgrade all three of them, because each of the three main brooms fills a niche. The way each position plays will be the biggest factor, but your playstyle also matters, so keep that in mind as you read the rest of this.</p><p dir="ltr">For my money, <strong>the Shooting Star is best for chasers</strong>, whose main job is to get downfield quickly and without getting knocked out. But since you have three chasers, it's not the worst idea to throw in one Cleansweep among them so you can have a point guard who can fly circles around everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">I also enjoy the Shooting Star for beaters who like to roam all over, <strong>but a beater who stays on their own team's end of the field may be better suited with a Comet</strong>. But this one is very subjective--what really matters here is you pick a broom with high durability. The other stat is more of a personal choice.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For a seeker, the choice is very easy; </strong>you need the speed and maneuverability of the Cleensweep. If you want to have any hope of catching the snitch before Harry Potter or Draco Malfoy, you'll need to make full use of the Cleansweep's speed and maneuverability.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the keeper will need a Comet because its high maneuver speed is necessary for hopping between the three goals you're defending, and its high durability is also essential--it would be <em>really </em>bad if your keeper got knocked out.</p><p dir="ltr">As you play, be sure to regularly upgrade your brooms.

            <p>
High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has returned to YouTube - two months after admitting he exchanged "messages with an individual minor" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" - accusing critics of a "planned and coordinated attack", and asking, "Did any of you consider [they] may have been over the legal age of consent?".
</p>
<p>
Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>'s former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">claimed</a> an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a> when the publication spoke with two former Twitch employees.
</p>
<p>
In a lengthy response at the time, Beahm said, "I can now tell you my side of the story regarding the ban. Were there Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017? The answer is yes. Were there real intentions behind these messages, the answer is absolutely not."

<p>
"These were casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate," Beahm continued, "but nothing more. Nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed, I never even met the individual. I went through a lengthy arbitration regarding a civil dispute with Twitch and that case was resolved by a settlement. Let me be clear, it was not a criminal case against me and no criminal charges have ever been brought against me."
</p>
<p>
Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - has <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. But now, after a period away from the spotlight, a clearly agitated Beahm has returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Breahm admits, comes ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his previously de-monetised channel. 
</p>
<p>
In a 20-minute diatribe mixing prepared statement and seemingly unplanned outburst, Beahm referred to Conners as a "fucking rat", insisting he "wasn't even involved" in the Twitch investigation that would see him <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">banned from the platform</a>. Beahm also repeatedly disputed accusations a minor had been involved in the incident that led to his ban from Twitch, asking, "When you and all these so-called journalists, Cody, fired off your tweets, did any of you consider that the Twitch user may have been over the legal age of consent at the time of the messages?" This is despite the fact Beahm himself previously admitted to sending "Twitch Whisper messages with an individual minor back in 2017".
</p>
<p>
Beahm also insisted he "never intended to meet" the user involved in the accusations, and "never made plans to meet at TwitchCon", instead saying, "I suspect all of you sort of planned and coordinated this attack. These big-time publications, these journalists... act like they're just gossip channels now, without any real journalism, and real research happening."
</p>
<p>
Beahm went on to claim he was deliberately targeted by a former Twitch partner manager who he requested to be replaced because he "didn't do anything for me... he was never on my channel, he didn't follow me on Twitter, he wouldn't even inform us about Twitch Rivals tournaments." Beahm continued, "Just a few months later, that ex-Twitch partner manager is directly involved in getting me banned. Coincidence? The Twitch user [involved in the case] tells [them] they do not want to report anything to Twitch but this ex Twitch partner manager encourages the user and even directs them to file a report directly with Twitch, even though the user told them clearly that we never physically met anywhere and that no photographs were exchanged." Beahm does not explain why the former partner manager believed potentially inappropriate behaviour had occurred in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
"I'll say it again," Beahm continued. "Neither I nor the Twitch user exchanged any sexually graphic messages or images... I even used the word 'inappropriate' purposely, and look how it was defined by everyone, including these defaming articles. I'm sorry but mutual bantering with inappropriate jokes taken out of context should have never led to me getting banned from Twitch."
</p>
<p>
Beahm then offered a lengthy explanation of how the report was progressed - wrongly he claims - first to Twitch's law enforcement response team, and then to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. "As far as I know," he added, "they didn't escalate Twitch's report to law enforcement. Mind you, the same people that made this decision [at Twitch] admitted internally that the messages did not constitute sexting... that the messages did not warrant any child sexual abuse material charge... Twitch makes this decision to terminate my contract and ban me while admitting they never investigated the age of consent in the jurisdiction where the user's messages were sent and received."
</p>
<p>
"I don't claim to be perfect," Beahm added toward the end of his statement, "but I also didn't do all the shit that they're saying I did. But then that doesn't make a story, right? They wanted media attention, the media wants controversy, and by sensationalising all this with big inaccurate headlines like 'sexting' and 'sexually explicit', you all got what you wanted at the expense of [me]. The reality is they wanted to cut down the Doc, plain and simple.... It's so obvious that certain Twitch executives and employees involved had personal biases against the Doc and used all of these as an opportunity to terminate my contract."
</p>
<p>
"I'm not denying the exchange of Whispers," Beahm concluded. "I'm not denying that to all of you out there. It looks bad. I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was inappropriate. If it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Conners, or the public is claiming that I did."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-youtube-twitch-drlupo-timthetatman-swagg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember a few years ago when YouTube started <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/10/twitch-youtube-drlupo-timthetatman-leave-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aggressively throwing money</a> at some of Twitch’s golden-egg-laying-est geese, leading to widespread speculation that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/14/youtube-strategy-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube might supplant Twitch</a> as the internet’s premiere livestreaming destination? That… didn’t happen. This week saw three big-name streamers – Ben “Dr Lupo” Lupo, Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar, and Kris "Swagg" Lamberson – <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/swagg-timthetatman-drlupo-come-back-twitch-multistreaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return to Twitch</a> after their lucrative YouTube exclusivity contracts expired. From here on out, the former two will stream on both Twitch and YouTube, while the latter is focusing on Twitch. The more things change, the more they stay the same. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin by marveling at the speed with which <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony pulled the plug on its latest live service offering</a>, <em>Concord</em>, a game so focused-grouped for everyone that it ended up being for no one. Are live service games as a whole doomed? Probably not. But the way triple-A publishers approach them – toiling away for years and then releasing something that feels dated on day one – likely is.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we reflect on the great Twitch vs YouTube livestreaming war, which seems to be ending with a whimper rather than a bang. Now that Twitch allows creators to stream to multiple platforms and YouTube seems uninterested in significantly improving its streaming product, why not? In the end, nobody really won The Streaming Wars. Instead, they got distracted trying to copy TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NaNoWriMo’s weird stance on AI</a>, which – as with most supposed defenses of AI as a creative tool – just doesn’t really make much sense. Oh, and I absolutely knock it out of the park with my segment transitions this week. Do not believe anyone who tells you otherwise!</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can sink millions into doomed live service <em>and </em>platform exclusivity efforts (or at least into <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paying ourselves sustainable salaries</a>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>[These streamers] are now streaming to Twitch and YouTube, which has become the new meta ever since Twitch started letting people do it last year. So we’re in this place where a few years ago, all the headlines were about the exclusivity wars between Twitch and YouTube. They were trying to lock down all the biggest names, and YouTube was making these big moves to try to become the new destination for livestreaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Here we are a few years later, and both have abandoned that strategy. YouTube really isn’t offering contracts like that to streamers anymore. Twitch still kind of does it in places, but not really. It’s interesting to see how things have changed, in part because the landscape shifted and now everyone’s on every platform. Even we’re doing that, to an extent. You post everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Technically you’ve been able to do that forever. You can stream to two different [platforms]. That’s not hard. It’s a very easy thing to do. The only thing preventing people was the money – and also moderating two different platforms.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s the big issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, if you have two chats, that sucks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There have been debates this week between streamers about what to do now. Is the best approach to multi-stream because you’re allowed to and because you can maximize your audience’s size that way? Or is the strategy to focus on one streaming platform, because even beyond moderation, there’s also the issue of just engaging with an audience. It’s really hard to follow two chats at once. So if you want to engage with people – which is the point of livestreaming; the reason why it’s so popular is because there’s a back and forth – it doesn’t make sense to try to reach multiple audiences at once. Because at the end of the day, your YouTube audience or your Twitch audience or your Kick audience or whatever will have trouble talking to you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I hope people aren’t prioritizing their Kick audiences.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, but I had to include that because Kick does have a sizable audience for livestreaming at this point. I’d be remiss if I didn’t. But yeah, there are some people who say “Yeah, I’ve gotta be everywhere.” Ludwig, who’s one of the big remaining YouTube streamers, said that the next Kai Cenat isn’t going to come from multi-streaming. The next one of those is gonna be locked into a particular audience and culture. I don’t really have a take on this; I think that we’re going to have to wait and see what happens.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>People are talking about how there are tools you can use to unify chat display. Not surprising. It still sucks to do, I think. I think that’s annoying. There’s a company called Topping that makes an audience interface. It’s a very funny name for a company. They just got into audio interfaces, and they have one out called the OTG model. You can plug a phone into it and plug it into a computer and have the same mic audio going into a livestream on a phone and your computer.&nbsp;</p><p>So if you’re doing the shit we’re talking about where you have a TikTok livestream and another stream going into Twitch, you can do both of those and have the audio feed into both. That’s one of those things where you’re like “Who is this for?” And then you hear people doing this meta with multiple streams, and you’re like “That’s who it’s for.” People who want to stream to, like, five different platforms.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s still weird because the appeal of a chat is often the relationships within that chat. Even if you can address multiple groups, I think it still feels disjointed from a viewer perspective. Even if you see both chats at once via software, they’re not talking to each other. So you still end up in this odd spot.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I just want to make fun of the URL [for the company Chris mentioned], which is topping.pro, which I would click, but I would not expect to get what I’m told I’ll be getting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>This is like every time I see a commercial for Dick’s Sporting Goods, and they tell me to visit dicks.com. I’m like “I don’t believe you! I don’t believe I’m going to get what you say I’m going to get from this website!”</p><p>But anyway, back to the topic at hand, I think it’s interesting where all of this has gone. For a minute there, it seemed like YouTube really cared about streamers and wanted to make that a big part of its offering. They had this guy named Ryan Wyatt who was running that side of things, and he was very hands-on, talking with streamers on Twitter all the time. Actually, I wouldn’t be surprised if what Dan Clancy, the current CEO of Twitch, is doing was inspired by Ryan being the head of a division but also this big-time community guy who was always making appearances, and everyone knew him by name. Being everyone’s cool friend.&nbsp;</p><p>But then what happened is, YouTube discovered something that Twitch has kind of known all along: Streaming is not an easy way for companies to make money. And around the same time, shorts got big. TikTok blew up. YouTube was trying to become a major player in the streaming space in 2020 and 2021, which is right around the time that TikTok really caught on. So YouTube was like “We’ve gotta pivot to rip that off.” In the years that followed, streaming just kind of stalled out for them.</p><p>They encountered the same problem that Twitch has in another way: Discoverability isn’t great on YouTube if all you’re doing is streaming. So streamers who weren’t already huge struggled there. And now we’re sort of back at square one, where streaming is a thing YouTube doesn’t seem to care about that much and Twitch is the main place to go for it. All these millions of dollars were slung around at streamers in the name of winning a war between two tech giants, and the end result is a status quo that’s not that different from what came before.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mister-pi-de-10-nano-clone-board-taki-udon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Of all the consoles I have ever bought, few rival the sheer usefulness of my MiSTer. Based on a Terasic DE-10 Nano development board, the open source project encompasses a massive amount of consoles, old computers, and arcade machines with pinpoint accuracy. New additions happen every day thanks to the community of developers. I was lucky: I bought my DE-10 Nano board before the massive jump in prices a few years back, which has been the biggest barrier for new people attempting to gain entry to this community. All that may have just changed, thanks to a replacement clone board produced by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taki Udon</a>. And he’s not stopping there–he’s hoping to upend the entire MiSTer ecosystem.</p><p>I first became aware of Taki Udon while looking up reviews of retro handhelds on YouTube.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TakiUdon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> His channel,</a> with 369k subscribers as of this writing, often focuses on the inexpensive but powerful emulation handhelds from companies like Anbernic. There are countless devices like this with names like R35S, TRIMUI Smart Pro, or Miyoo Mini Pro. Most of them run some variant of Linux and are between $30-$100, which buys you a shocking amount of device.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="We Need to Talk." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnDSBbzYE5A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I became aware of Taki Udon first via his YouTube channel, where he publishes videos on retro handhelds like this.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki himself never appears on camera. All you see are his hands, usually in front of a single color sheet of seamless paper peppered with retro devices and narrated by his enthusiastic, cheerful voice. He does not talk about his personal life or experience explicitly (he says he wishes to open up in a video series later), but he says he is in the business of hardware development in China.&nbsp;</p><p>“I never liked that MiSTer was tied to a platform that was out of reach for many people,” Taki told me over Discord “For a few years, I wanted to do something with FPGA, but there was never a good opportunity. Late last year, I started having discussions about whether or not it would be possible to create a successor platform for developers to migrate to with more performance at a lower price. I reached out to members of the community to get some feedback on what kind of hardware features they would want in an upgraded dev board.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MiSTER Pi - Product Overview &amp; New User Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbppuWmukw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A product overview of the MiSTER Pi board.</figcaption></figure></div><p>“While that was happening, we started to work on creating a board that could run MiSTer as-is to get some experience making a board,” Taki told me. “When that board was done, we felt confident that we could make a similar board with an upgraded FPGA, but I thought it would not further our goal of trying to get more people into FPGA gaming if we did not offer up the R&amp;D board that we had. We would have also fragmented the community because there are a lot of people who still want to enjoy the systems that are supported by the current Cyclone V. So we paused work on making the successor platform and turned our focus to building out a cost-effective roadmap based on CV5.”</p><p>When Taki announced that he was not only creating a more affordable MiSTer clone board, but several commercial consoles and handhelds, I was taken aback. Announcing that many products is surprising to say the least. But his background, coupled with his <a href="https://x.com/takiudon_/status/1830814512959689157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close proximity</a> to hardware production in China, goes a long way to explaining how that might happen.</p><figure><figcaption>Laying it all out. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“Yeah, I live in China. I worked in consumer electronics for several years before forming my new company,” Taki said. “When it comes to prototyping, there are a lot of things that are easier to do here. There is no shortage of PCB companies that you can work with, and it is fast and cheap to get boards made by some of the companies that you mentioned. Those companies already have great pricing on their global websites, but they charge way less on the domestic platform.”</p><figure><figcaption>So far all that Taki has posted aside of the rest of the line is this brief tease of the handhelds and some early close-ups of the consoles. Credit: <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_/status/1826602501044666743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taki Udon</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last few months, Taki has been teasing out a drip feed of hints and images, asking for design feedback from the community with the product line growing more and more ambitious. His account is one of the few I have notifications turned on for, and usually updates late at night. As of this writing, multiple products have been announced: “Flagship, mainstream, budget cartridge, and two handhelds,” Taki told me.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Full Stack. Credit: Taki Udon</figcaption></figure><p>“After I decided that I wanted to sell the bare $99 board, I sat down and decided to try and come up with a product roadmap that would reuse the work that we had already done. I took a full day to draw 2D ID for three consoles and a single handheld. I'd have to look at timestamps, but I remember it taking 14 hours or so. The next day, I had a meeting with my cofounder, and I pitched all four products to see which ones would get greenlit. Needless to say, they all got approved. Those three consoles turned into four during the rest of the ID stage, and the single handheld split into two.</p><p>“For this project, we did some rapid prototyping on accessory boards using those services. It's awesome to be able to get a board file, modify some of the routing, and have the order fully processed and shipped to your house in 48 hours.”</p><p>While Taki Udon has been announcing his product roadmap, at least two other <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1791769986396307930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyclone-V based DE-10 Nano</a> clone boards have emerged on the market, one of which has integrated RAM, by a company called QMTech.

They are not without their limitations and quirks, particularly when it comes to compatibility with the existing ecosystem of MiSTer cases and I/O boards, <a href="https://x.com/zyjnumber1/status/1829442478426169724" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although QMTech sells their own hats</a>. But that makes Taki Udon’s board and ecosystem of multiple potential consoles all the more interesting, and more competition within this space only further loosens the bottleneck that Terasic has imposed on an otherwise open source project.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Switch Lite OLED - Engineering Preview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufYiLnbOkbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>On top of all this, Taki is also doing a Switch Lite OLED.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Taki does not seem worried. “The community is still kind of small compared to other things that I have worked on, but I think there are a lot of people who are excited about this little niche growing with cheaper products. That motivates me to want to work harder on this. In terms of things being harder than I expected, I wouldn't say anything was really that difficult for the product that will launch this month. Everything has been pretty smooth, all things considered, but that's mostly because we aren't solving any difficult technical challenges to make this product.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We are also working on a Switch Lite OLED screen, and that is orders of magnitude more complex from a product standpoint than making the triple stack at a cheaper price.

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-recommend-id="image://adbf93e5f3781335c25911eccce26e64" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Space Marine Titus holding back a large wave of aliens.

Literally or metaphorically, from <em>Final Fantasy Legend</em>/<em>SaGa</em> and <em>Star Ocean</em> to <em>Xenogears </em>and even some <em>Final Fantasies</em>, a foundational narrative in which our heroes push back against a cruel, manipulative creator is like a spinal cord holding up many a juggernaut of Japanese RPG canon. But another enduring Square Enix series, quietly running just as long as the others, takes the opposite approach, embracing the positive side of religion and mythology. These are games about unity, the healing powers of nature, and the virtuous pride brought from trusting in a benevolent higher power. No, not <em>Dragon Quest</em>; yes, you visit churches to save in those games, but then you go and hang out in pubs and gamble like an exhausted salaryman.

Make sure you don’t start a New Cycle afterward, though, as there is still more to do.</p><p>After choosing to continue your journey, you’ll need to find Mount Mei, with arguably the most difficult boss in the game, Erlang, the Sacred Divinity, waiting to greet anyone who’s made it this far. Finally, after beating Erlang and the Four Heavenly Kings that follow him, you’ll need to beat The Great Sage’s Broken Shell just one more time. Then, after what is sure to result in hours of work, you’ll be rewarded with the Black Myth: Wukong true secret ending, which includes a gorgeously animated video.</p><p>It's… a lot!

<p>According to a social media <a href="https://x.com/atomicmassgames/status/1832106250911494539">post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Atomic Mass Games decided to release cards for the announced, then canceled, <em>Star Wars X-Wing TIE Phantom </em>and<em> Alpha Class Starwing</em> ship packs.</p>

In addition, the game's points document has been updated to include the new ships.</p>
<p>Like all <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> ship packs, the cards in <em>TIE Phantom</em> and <em>Alpha Class Starwing </em>contain a mix of tactics, weapons, pilot cards, and spaceship artwork courtesy of Timothy Ben Zweifel, Matt Bradbury, Mark Molnar, and Anthony Deville.</p>
<p>This is the first piece of new content for <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> since April 2022. The original game was released in 2012 by Fantasy Flight Games. In 2018, the game received <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-x-wing-minatures-game-2nd-edition-core-set-review-perfect-time-to-join" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a second edition</a>.</p>
<p>Since its release, the game has had 12 waves of expansions. These expansions have added multiple ships and factions from across the Star Wars franchise, including the CIS and Old Republic from the prequel trilogy and the New Republic and First Order from the sequel trilogy.</p>

These include <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/star-wars-legion-early-2021-expansions-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars Legion</em></a>, and <em>Star Wars Armada</em>. This past June, Atomic Mass Games announced they were <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/update-on-star-wars-x-wing-and-star-wars-armada/">stopping development</a> on both <em>X-Wing</em> and <em>Armada</em>.</p>
<p>Atomic Mass Games has stopped all active development on both miniature games but continues to support the community through tournaments and organized play events.</p>
<p>If you want some new content in your <em>Star Wars X-Wing</em> skirmishes, these print-and-play ship cards may do the trick. As for miniature models, there's always the option of DIY 3D printing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-first-stream-back/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Dr Disrespect appeared on camera for the first time since June to address the recent allegations of ‘minor messaging’ that were levelled against him on social media. It has been one of the most storied topics in the content creation world in the last couple of months, ever since former Twitch employees came forward with their claims.</p>



<p>In the opening 20 minutes of his return stream, Dr Disrespect blasted Twitch, confirmed that he’s still not denying what he did, and attempted to set the story straight from his perspective, all in front of 240,000 viewers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-this-was-handled-years-ago">‘This Was Handled Years Ago’</h2>



<p>In his first stream in more than two months, Dr Disrespect kicked off by giving an expansive account of his side of the story. As the reports go, Dr Disrespect messaged a minor on Twitch in 2017 (which he has admitted to doing), and in 2020, this was discovered and used as ‘fuel’ to get him kicked off the platform.</p>



<p>That’s the abbreviated version of this lengthy debacle.</p>



<p>Per Dr Disrespect’s to clear things up, things turned sour for him and Twitch when in 2019 he was assigned a partner manager he instantly failed to work well with. Shortly after, a grudge was formed and the ‘partner manager’ started probing into Dr Disrespect’s Whispers – which was Twitch’s on-platform private messaging service.</p>



<p>Following a review by the Trust and Safety team at Twitch, no wrongdoing was found, but this unnamed partner manager persisted and used a friend to force the messages onto the ‘Law Enforcement Team’ at Twitch. Again, no wrongdoing was found, despite it having an ‘investment’ from a company director.</p>



<p>This process reportedly included reviews by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, amongst others, and again, no illegal actions were discovered, and therefore, nothing was taken any further. Dr Disrespect also claimed that the victim in question had no interest in escalating the situation to Twitch, and at no point were Dr Disrespect <strong>or </strong>the victim interviewed.</p>



<p>Hunter clipped the full segment below:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dr Disrespect's full 20 minute response after returning to stream. He says: </p><p>– He was not found guilty of anything <br>– The individual did not want to file a report but Twitch pushed them to<br>– His old Twitch partner manager was targeting him and personally escalated messages to… <a href="https://t.co/hr7YyE4uhV">pic.twitter.com/hr7YyE4uhV</a></p></div>— Hunter (@HUN2R) <a href="https://twitter.com/HUN2R/status/1832131401044414870?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>On stream, Dr Disrespect said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It has affected us on so many levels – back in 2020, and now in 2024. And Cody Connors, I just have to say it again… Why would you do this? Like I said, this was handled professionally years ago, no wrongdoing. But because of you, Cody, we just lost — unfortunately, we had to lay off people from Midnight Society, because of you, Cody.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is a reference to the individual who ignited this situation back in June with posts on social media.</p>



<p>After that, he said again:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For all you Doc haters, I’m sure you’ll jsut dissect all of this and still find a way to publically criticise me, but do what you need to do. But this isn’t for you. This is for my team today, my community, and my friends that have supported me. And I’m not denying the exchange of Whispers, Champs.</p>



<p>I’m not denying that to all of you out there, it looks bad. I have no way of knowing if the Twitch user thought our exchange of Whispers was innappropriate, and if it was, I apologise. All I know is that I never did what Twitch, Cody Connors, or the public is claiming that I did.</p>



<p>That’s it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Many were quick to state that Dr Disrespect ‘has no receipts’ for much of this, but throughout this entire event, there has also been nothing from those condemning him to verify his wrongdoing. He has copped to it and held his hands up, and now he’s trying to do some damage control and claw back his career.</p>



<p>He explained that he’s eligible to apply for monetisation on YouTube on September 25, and if he lands it, then it just might remain business as usual for the streamer.</p>
