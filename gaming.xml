		<p>Team Peak has revealed that next week on November 5th it will be updating Peak and adding a new biome for players. That biome has been called Roots and from the brief teaser it looks like there will be tree climbing involved, and possibly spiders grabbing players. You can check out the short look at the Roots biome in the teaser below.</p>

			<p>While EA is all-in on <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> right now after it had a massive launch at the beginning of October and earlier this week launched its battle royale mode, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-battlefield-redsec-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/">Battlefield REDSEC</a>, Respawn is still chugging away at Apex Legends, with its 27th season set to arrive next week, titled 'Amped.'</p>



<p>The new season arrives with a refresh to one of the game's more popular maps, Olympus, and buffs for a few Legends, specifically Valkyrie, Rampart, and Horizon. This season also adds new mechanics that'll make the game even faster than it already is, with a new mantle boost giving players a speed boost on wall-bounces and mantling over ledges.</p>



<p>A new gameplay trailer shows off the new mantle mechanics while featuring the aforementioned legends, and of course, the new refresh for Olympus, titled Olympus: Rising, is also heavily showcased.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Amped Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkLtbMz5uz8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Regarding buffs for Valkyrie, her VTOL jets are getting a speed boost, while her missile swarm no longer does any self-damage, nor does it have height restrictions. It also scans enemies hit with the swarrm and places a cooldown on movement passive abilities. Her Skyward Dive also has a shorter takeoff time.</p>



<p>For Rampart, her Amped Cover walls gain health with Evo increases and even include a roof. For Horizon, her Gravity Lift cooldown time has been reduced, while her Black Hole ability now gains even more health.</p>



<p>For all legends, the mantle boost gives players a speed boost for wall and ledge bounces, and the Trident now has improved collision and its own dedicated health bar.</p>



<p>In all the hullabaloo of Battlefield 6, it's easy to lose Apex Legends in the mix. That said, it's consistently stayed above <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/#1y">150K concurrent players on Steam this year</a>, only dipping below that figure a handful of times. There's no denying that it's still popular, and its longevity is not to be dismissed, as few live service games make it to their 27th season. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware Revenue Still in Freefall, Microsoft Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-hardware-revenue-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-revenue-still-in-freefall-microsoft-reveals.1339597/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has released its first-quarter fiscal results for the 2025-26 financial year, and Xbox consoles appear to be continuing their sales freefall, although "content and services" revenue is up.</p>

<p>In the company's latest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q1/more-personal-computing-performance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial release</a>, Microsoft says its Xbox hardware revenue has dropped by 29% when compared to the same period last year, and given that Xbox hardware sales have been in decline for a while now, that's not good news for the gaming division.</p>

<p>There's a silver lining for Microsoft, though, albeit a very small one; content and services revenue, which includes the company's Game Pass service as well as gaming-related software, increased by (an admittedly paltry) 1%, driven by "growth in Xbox Game Pass and third-party content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=Nf1aQZo1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-hardware-revenue-decline.jpg?itok=KeapOShe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass continues to grow, albeit slowly.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the first quarter of Microsoft's fiscal year covers the period between June and September, so it doesn't take into account the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">controversial Game Pass changes</a> introduced earlier this month, which saw the price of top tier Ultimate jump to $30 per month.</p>

<p>The data also won't include major Xbox releases for the end of the year, like&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, the latter of which will almost certainly boost sales in the coming second quarter.</p>

<p>Still, Xbox's continuing console woes don't appear to be deterring the company from continuing to pursue hardware development, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors" rel="nofollow">at least not officially</a>; it's been confirmed that there will be a next-generation Xbox console, and that it's being developed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">in conjunction with tech company AMD</a>.</p>

<p>Despite that, Xbox is currently chasing a multi-platform strategy, with major releases like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">Halo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War</a>&nbsp;</em>no longer confined to Xbox consoles. That's unlikely to change, even when Xbox does eventually release its next machine.</p>




<p>This data also doesn't take into account the newly-released ROG Xbox Ally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">handhelds</a>, although whether they'll be enough to tip the scales and reverse the company's woeful hardware performance is unclear.</p>

<p>Things are looking a little rosier for Microsoft as a whole, however; the software giant <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q1/press-release-webcast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> a revenue increase of 18%, which I'm sure will soothe the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">thousands of employees who lost their jobs</a> during the company's latest round of layoffs.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panic-stations-fall-guys-devs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-veterans-form-new-uk-based-studio-panic-stations.1339591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A group of ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers, including one of developer Mediatonic's co-founders, have banded together to create a brand new UK-based studio called Panic Stations, and they're already hard at work on their first game.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Panic Stations' staffers include&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>designers Dan Hoang and Joe Walsh (no, not that one), as well as social and community lead Oliver Hindle, who shaped&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' "distinctive voice and viral presence" online.</p>

<p>They're joined by Mediatonic co-founder Paul Croft, who, along with Josh Tarrant, is also one of the founders of new indie development collective Skeleton Crew (not to be confused with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/panic-stations-ex-fall-guys-devs-founders.jpg?itok=ZPv71Qtb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/panic-stations-ex-fall-guys-devs-founders.jpg?itok=1VzAqLRW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Panic Stations counts several ex-<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developers among its number.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned press release, Panic Stations' goal is to create "fun, fresh, physics-based co-op games with a sense of humor", and not only that, but the studio is aiming to "release a few every year".</p>

<p>Panic Stations is already hard at work on its first game, it seems; the studio says it will announce its debut project "soon", so we shouldn't have too much longer to wait before we know whether this new UK outfit is aiming to take on&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>' crown (as it were).</p>

<p>Whatever Panic Stations is working on, it sounds like it'll be an online offering; founder Paul Croft says he's a "huge fan of the online co-op space" and that he wants to make games that "bring people closer together".</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer announcing Panic Stations' formation, which takes the form of a sort of pigeon-based mockumentary, right here. It's very characteristic of the founders' humor, I think.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Panic Stations comes up with, but in the meantime, if you're jonesing for some physics-y multiplayer fun, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>and its ranked mode, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-ranked-knockout" rel="nofollow">launched back in April last year</a>.</p>

            <p>Onion Games have released the English language version of Stray Children, a "bittersweet, fairytale RPG" I hadn't heard of till Oisin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-children-the-oddball-rpg-from-the-devs-behind-cult-classic-moon-is-coming-to-pc-in-english-later-this-year">wrote it up in June</a>, and then became very excited about. 
</p>
<p>Created by Onion Games, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>, Stray Children takes place in a world of kids besieged by monstrous adults. The kids live in a stronghold, while the adults, aka Olders, roam the landscapes beyond, each "carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather".</p> <!--more-->
<p>So... not a game I will play with my nephew, then. Not until he's 40, when I will hopefully be dead. It looks amazing, though: eerie and fizzy and a little depraved. There are treehouses and submarines and Icicle Bullets of Love. Here's a trailer.
</p>

<figure>

<p>As every child knows, it can be difficult to defeat grown-ups through force of arms. You may find it more effective to talk to them, surgically targeting their psychic vulnerabilities with phrases like "do you remember having hair" and "nobody remembers that thing you like". As in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, you can talk to opponents in Stray Children to trigger various responses and overcome their defences.</p><p>Also as in Undertale, the battle system is a mix of turn-based and shmuppy, with players darting out of the path of various weaponised metaphors. What do the squealing piglets stand for? I am going to say: somebody's inability to deal with the fact that they never mastered the clarinet.
</p>
<p>"Deftly dodge the relentless barrage of their bottled-up emotions, and discover the source of their strange stories," encourages <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">the Steam page</a>. "By touching their heart with your words, you might just be able to save their souls." The Steam blurb concludes with a moderately atypical plea from the dev. "We hope you'll have fun discovering all the secrets of Stray Children, but we have one final request for anyone and everyone who finishes the game: please keep the ending a secret!"
</p><p>
While Moon: Remix RPG Adventure was a re-release of Love-de-Lic's anti-RPG Moon from 1997 - one of the major influences on Toby Fox's Undertale, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cult-90s-rpg-and-undertale-inspiration-moon-remix-rpg-adventure-is-headed-to-pc">caveat</a> that he never actually played it beforehand - Stray Children is a new project from Onion Games director and game designer Yoshiro Kimura, whose credits include Romancing SaGa 2 and Rule of Rose.
</p><p>The Tokyo-based studio's other members include art director Kurashima Kazuyuki, who worked on Live A Live and Super Mario RPG, and composer and sound designer Hirofumi Taniguchi, who did music for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden">Suikoden</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/contra">Contra</a>: Hard Corps. In short: pedigree.</p>
<p>I'd love to include some hands-on impressions, but I've just seen this pop up on my feed. I've read three launch Steam reviews, which are as follows: "Undertale but heterosexual", "heterosexual but Undertale", and then, an actual review from a self-described bug tester who comments that Stray Children shouldn't be compared too avidly to either Moon or Undertale. It certainly looks like a world of its own.</p>

              <p>Winter power outages seem to pick the worst times to strike, such as during holiday gatherings of friends or when you are hosting game night in your living room. Portable power stations solve this anxiety by keeping your most-used devices running when the grid goes down, and EcoFlow has launched its Black Friday deals with aggressive pricing that makes premium backup power surprisingly affordable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic has been cut from $599 down to just $399</a>, which undercuts even budget gas generators while d<strong>elivering 1800 watts of clean, silent power without fumes or maintenance headaches</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Electric Power</h2>
<p>The <strong>continuous 1800-watt output</strong> is ready to power refrigerators, microwaves, laptops and space heaters and do that for several devices at the same time in case of outages. That <strong>3600-watt surge capacity handles the surge in power</strong> that happens when things like refrigerator compressors kick in to prevent tripping or shutdowns when your refrigerator compressor comes on. It offer <strong>two USB-C ports (100W and 30W), one USB-C port and three AC outputs</strong>.</p>



<p>The 1024 Wh LiFePO4 battery offers ample capacity to <strong>run a typical refrigerator for around 12 to 15 hours</strong> and keep your food from spoiling during extended blackouts. This automotive-grade battery chemistry offers superior safety and longevity, compared to standard lithium-ion cells, retaining more than 80% of its original capacity even after 4000 complete charge cycles. That’s <strong>more than 10 years of use daily</strong> which makes this a lifetime investment rather than a disposable emergency tool.</p>
<p>X-Stream Fast Charging Technology provides <strong>charging from completely dead to 80% capacity in as little as 45 minutes</strong> with a standard wall outlet. That kind of speed is critical when weather forecasts predict an incoming storm and you have forgotten to keep your battery topped up. The system intelligently identifies the optimal voltage and current to maximize charging speed, and avoids battery degradation that many cheaper units with aggressive charging profiles suffer from.</p>



<p>A <strong>UPS switching time of less than 10 milliseconds safeguards desktop computers, servers, NAS systems</strong> and medical equipment against power interruptions. This near-instant transition happens so fast that most electronics won’t be able to detect the changeover, thus preventing data loss, system crashes or disrupted medical treatments. The pure sine wave output provides grid-quality power, just like what’s coming out of your wall outlets, to ensure sensitive electronics get clean electricity free of voltage fluctuations that can burn out circuit boards.</p>
<p>The cell-to-chassis construction design shields the battery from drops, bumps, and transport vibrations that would destroy loosely mounted cells. This automotive-inspired structural approach insulates the battery cells from external impacts, improving thermal management by direct contact with the chassis. The unit operates reliably in temperatures from freezing cold to scorching heat, handles 95% humidity levels and resists 5% salt spray which makes it perfect for coastal areas and harsh environments where cheaper power stations just don’t cut it.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $599, this Black Friday deal undercuts the price of budget gas generators and delivers superior convenience, safety, and long-term value in return.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new rumour states that Valve may have begun work on a Half-Life 3 trailer. </p>



<p>Valve has been utterly silent about the next instalment to the Half-Life series, with only rumours, datamines, and leaks being our only source of information. Most recently, we heard that the upcoming title was being developed as the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/half-life-3-has-been-designed-to-be-the-final-chapter-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final chapter</a>‘ of the franchise. Now, a new rumour states that a trailer for HLX/HL3 is already in the works. </p>



<h2 id="h-half-life-3-s-announcement-and-launch-will-be-very-close-to-each-other-it-s-claimed">Half-Life 3’s Announcement And Launch Will Be Very Close to Each Other, It’s Claimed</h2>



<p>The latest update regarding Valve’s work on Half-Life 3’s trailer comes from Tyler McVicker’s latest HLX Files episode on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKR-G1EuYyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. McVicker says that the “current rumour that’s going around is that work on the trailer is occurring.” McVicker added that Valve’s approach to trailers is very different from “publicly-owned triple-A studios'” approach.</p>



<p>The video also mentioned that trailers and announcements typically arrive close to a year before launch. However, “Valve is not doing that.” Players are going to get Half-Life 3’s announcement and launch “very close together”, similar to what they saw with Half-Life Alyx.</p>



<p>McVicker explains that when trailers are created for games that are still far from launch, developers “have to effectively fake” what is being showcased, with very specific scripted content being pushed to the finish line earlier than the rest of the game’s aspects. </p>



<p>However, players should take this information with a grain of salt, as it was not obtained through a data leak or datamine, and Valve has not officially announced anything. </p>

		<p>Football Manager 26 gives the impression of a youngster being given their first senior debut for a big club, stepping into the public eye looking to take the reins from the old guard. It is a new chapter for Sports Interactive’s long running series with a leap to a new game engine and a shift in how it is presented to players. After quite a few hours playing through Football Manager 26, it is a game that shows some promise, but needs a lot of long term updates and changes before it is ready to be considered a successful switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The caveat is that currently Football Manager 26 is considered to be in beta ahead of its official 4th November release, with Sports Interactive releasing regular fixes and updates through this window. That said, Football Manager 26 is clearly a very different experience to the Football Manager games that came before.</p>


<p>A new user interface comes with different tiles and cards you can click on to get more information, there’s a change in the matchday presentation, removal of touchline shouts, removal of gestures for team talks and press conferences, and a delayed release for international management to line up with next year’s World Cup. A positive addition is the long-awaited introduction of women’s leagues as well as new nation leagues that expand the database.</p>


<p>The user interface takes getting used to with a change to menus and the amount of data that is presented to you, split across tabs like the top level Portal, Recruitment, Matchday, Squad, and Club. Within each tab various tiles present information like league position, performance, finances or whatever else you want to look up. While it does look modern, it will take a while to get used to and retrain the muscle memory after so many years of the Football Manager UI being relatively stable. While there is a lot of information, it can be quite overwhelming to find what you need quickly and needing to keep clicking to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Information could be much clearly presented too. News stories are not shown in detail when you open a message in the portal, instead needing to click on it to see the full details. It was much clearer in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/football-manager-2024-review/">Football Manager 24</a>. When it comes to the matchday experience player fitness levels are much harder to read. Where FM24 had big and bold player tiles easily showing the information, the same information is more compact in FM26, and it is not as easy on the eye. This goes for spotting injuries during matches and player skill levels as well. At one point a player was injured who needed subbing off, but it was not clear looking at the tactics screen who I was needing to hook off the pitch.</p>

<p>The change extends to the general tactics screen. Sports Interactive wants players to get a lot more detail when it comes to sorting tactics and there is a depth of information. With tactics you now don’t just select a playstyle, a couple of formations to train, set instructions, and slot your players in. Now, formations are split into in possession and out of possession, so you can set two different tactical approaches to deal with different opponents. It is a good idea to really develop your team and reflects more of how modern teams approach different game states, but there are issues in just moving players and positions around. Swapping players either lags or sometimes does not happen as intended, and trying to adjust positions is not as smooth as in previous instalments.</p>

<p>What is clear right now is that Football Manager 26, in this current stage at least, is the first step of a new era. Much like the start of any new era that comes with a challenge of rebuilding and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better, but with what I have played so far I do not think this is going to be the entry that will hit the potential of what the switch to the new engine and implementation of new features can bring. In my view, it may take one or two more years for the rebuild to really meet its potential.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles doesn't feature any of the additional content found in the War of the Lions release and the mobile versions of the game, but this could quickly become a thing of the past, as a new mod now available online restores a small portion of this additional content.</p>



<p>The WotL Character Repair mod, developed by Dana Crysalis and now available for download for free from Nexus Mods, fixes Balthier and Luso, making it possible to add them to the party via Cheat Engine tables and use them in battle with their unique Jobs and ability sets. </p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's no way to add the two characters to the game without using Cheat Engine due to how difficult it currently is to add new events to the game. Installation requires using the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases/tag/1.29.2">Reloaded-II loader</a>, which can be less intuitive than just dropping some files into an installation folder.  Still, these are only minor inconveniences, considering the value of the mod.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Balthier-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Balthier and Lus</em><em>o</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> are now fully functional in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles thanks to this new mod</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Curious to see how well this new Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles mod works, I briefly tested it and can confirm that it indeed works as intended. I was able to add both Balthier and Luso to a battle party and use them as if they were a regular vanilla unit, which is not possible to do without this Repair mod, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-war-of-the-lions-content/">as my previous attempts testify</a>. Hopefully, more fixes will come for the Dark Knight and Onion Knight Jobs to make them usable and further expand the game's content.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles is not the definitive version of the popular tactical role-playing game, lacking the aforementioned War of the Lions content, this new release is more than worth playing thanks to the many improvements it brings. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-classic-strategy-modern-upgrades/">You can learn more about them by checking out my review.</a></p>

Now he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-kid-trick-or-treaters-you-have-no-weight-n815196">take candy</a>.</p> <p>I normally wait until the last minute to pick up candy for Halloween. This entails going to the supermarket during my lunch break on Halloween only to find that all of the Halloween-themed bags have already been replaced with Christmas ones. This usually leaves me with no option but to buy the only candy that normally comes individually wrapped in bulk: blow-pops and stacks and stacks of fun-sized chocolate bars. Beggars can’t be choosers. I pay whatever the Halloween gods demand. No child will leave my house emptyhanded on All Hallows’ Eve.</p> <p>This year I broke with tradition and headed to the supermarket a few nights ahead of time. The pickings were still slim but not altogether terrible. The prices, on the other hand, stopped me in my tracks. It was supposed to be a quick shop. In and out. Instead, I stared at the bags of Snickers and Reece’s Cups like I was picking which arm to get amputated. A big bag of assorted Hershey’s candy was almost $17. That couldn’t be right. I checked again. Ouch. I went for a small bag of Butterfingers. It was $6.59. That would not be nearly enough. Five smaller bags or two bigger ones? Either way, I was getting hosed.</p>

   <p>The irony, of course, is that I do not need nearly this much candy. I always have a ton left over, sitting in the bowl and rotting my teeth through mid-November. But what if this year is different? What if busses of children roll up to my street demanding dispensation? Better safe than sorry. And so I pay to subsidize the fat cats at Mars and Hershey. Apparently I have it easy. One particularly grim thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inflation/comments/1oiotkg/has_anyone_noticed_the_cost_of_the_halloween/">the inflation subreddit</a> tells a different story.</p>

 <p>“I just spent $95 on 4 small bags of candy bar minis (110 mini pieces per bag), and 1 bag of jolly rancher gummy minis that will not get me through the night,” it reads. Some say they’ll just hide in their bedrooms that night watching TV with the lights out. Others are downgrading to cheaper candy. “Stopped doing chocolate and candy bars as that is where inflation is taking the biggest hit,” one person wrote. “Gummy and hard candies are still reasonable. $16 got us like 80 small packs of sour patch kids and when there are gone, they’re gone. Lights out. No more.”</p>

 <h2>Tariffs and bad cocoa harvests</h2> <p>Is candy actually getting way more expensive? Why yes, yes it is. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">NBC News reports</a> that multiple years of bad cocoa harvests in regions like West Africa, due in part to rising temperatures and changing climate conditions, have created a shortage that’s led to skyrocketing prices. “The cost of chocolate has surged nearly 30% since last Halloween,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/halloween-candy-hauls-shrink-chocolate-swapped-cheaper-alternatives">reports Fox News</a>.</p>

 <p>But gummies and other non-chocolate candy is also up. “General manufacturing costs for candy makers, including energy, labor and transportation, have risen 37 percent since early 2024,” one supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">told NBC News</a>. One TikTok deal hunter told the outlet that her normal go-to discount tricks have still gone from $1.50 a bag to $2.50 in some cases this year.</p>   <p>And of course there’s the Trump tariff factor. “The tariffs have hit every single piece of what goes into every single thing,” a small chocolate business owner in North Carolina <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/business/why-halloween-candy-is-getting-more-expensive-and-less-chocolate-y">told CNN</a>. “There is no new normal.” As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/halloween-candy-prices-trump-tariffs-climate-change"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a>, “Donald Trump has placed tariffs on the biggest exporters of chocolate to the US. Imports from the Ivory Coast, the largest producer of cocoa, are taxed with a 21 percent tariff. Ecuador, the second-largest producer, faces a 15 percent tariff.” Prices of Tootsie Roll lollipops alone are up 30 percent on average this year, according to a recent report <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/tricks-treats-and-tariffs-how-trump-is-making-halloween-more-expensive/">by The Century Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the cruelest part of all of this is that amid the current government shutdown, the Trump administration is set to let SNAP food benefits for the poorest Americans run out on November 1, the day after Halloween. Anyone on food assistance this week is stuck salvaging every penny they can instead of splurging on some candy for the neighborhood kids or their own. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/millions-face-food-aid-cliff-us-government-shutdown-standoff-2025-10-29/">The program currently has</a> access to $5.5 billion in reserve funds that Republicans are refusing to spend as they hold families hostage in negotiations with Democrats.</p>  <p>What Trump take, others can give back. You can <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank">search your area for a local food bank</a> to donate to. If you can afford it, try matching the funds you spend on candy this Halloween for food assistance in your region.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has only been around for a year as of today (October 30), and to say it’s been a success would be an understatement.</p>



<p>But just how much of a success has it truly been?</p>



<p>According to estimates from data firm <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dethrones-pokemon-go-as-it-celebrates-first-anniversary-and-13bn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pocketgamer</a>, the game has earned nearly $1.3 billion in revenue over its first 12 months. That makes it the most profitable Pokémon mobile game ever, surpassing the roughly $1 billion Pokémon Go earned in its first year.</p>



<p>As far as downloads go, AppMagic says it’s been downloaded more than 150 million times so far. That comes after it was downloaded </p>

<p>Released on October 30, 2024, Pokémon TCG Pocket is a mobile version of the popular trading card game. In the game, players buy and open packs to collect cards. These cards, as expected, can then be used to build full decks and battle against other players in a simplified version of the traditional card game.</p>



<p>In addition to collecting and battling, players can trade cards with friends. There are restrictions, though. Trades can only happen with friends and have to be of the same rarity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Halloween! It’s time for a <strong>spooky edition </strong>of NYT Connections. There are a few words in today’s puzzle synonymous with Halloween, which you’ll find if you scroll down to check out my NYT Connections hints for today. If you’re a fan of classic cartoons or video games, today’s puzzle should be a simple one for you.</p>



<p>In any case, I’ve assembled the top NYT Connections hints and solutions so that you can jump right to the answers and get on with your Halloween!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-31">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 31)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #873:</p>



<ul>
<li>GHOST</li>



<li>PUMPKIN</li>



<li>BOW</li>



<li>BED</li>



<li>ANCHOR</li>



<li>BEAR</li>



<li>MOUSE</li>



<li>CHERRIES</li>



<li>CHAIR</li>



<li>DOTS</li>



<li>SLIPPER</li>



<li>CAP</li>



<li>PIPE</li>



<li>PORRIDGE</li>



<li>SPINACH</li>



<li>MAGIC WAND</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>These are all items or characters Goldilocks encounters in the bears’ home</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Each word is tied to Cinderella’s transformation or helpers in her fairy tale journey</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These are all iconic items associated with the sailor man himself</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are all elements from the classic Ms. Pac-Man game, including her accessories and in-game items</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 31.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-31-873">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 31 (#873)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BACKBONE, COURAGE, HEART, SPIRIT</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – MEDIUM, OUTLET, PLATFORM, VENUE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – SACRUM, SEITAN, SEYCHELLES, SÉANCE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ABECEDARIUM, COMPUTER KEYBOARD, OUIJA BOARD, SCRABBLE</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>

<p>Landfall has not shared much else on social media or Steam, leaving players to speculate about what new badges might come with the update, which biome this new map will rotate with in the daily map updates, and what else might be hidden among the trees of this new area.</p><p>The last major update introduced the mesa biome, a desert dominated by tornadoes and scorching heat, which rotated with the alpine biome. Fans speculate that this one will rotate with the tropics biome, which comes directly after the starting biome, shore.</p><p>Other updates have included new badges alongside new biomes. The mesa update brought several challenges specific to it, so fans believe they will have new badges to collect next month as well.</p>

<p>The shelf life for ARC Raiders is going to be a long one. That means a lengthy trophy list is almost a given, and Embark Studios has gone ahead and delivered many trophies and achievements for you to strive for.</p>



<p>The extraction shooter market is a better place with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-launch-time-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> in it.

Several betas and playtests later, the full game finally launched on October 30.</p>



<p>Aplty enough, you’re going to ‘Embark’ on a heck of an adventure if you hope to complete the ARC Raiders trophy list.</p>

<p>Now that Dying Light: The Beast is out, Techland can start focusing again on Dying Light 2: Stay Human. The live-service, open-world zombie title has always enjoyed seasonal updates, and this Halloween, that remains the case. Techland has introduced a new event in Dying Light 2: Stay Human dubbed ‘Halloween Showdown’, and it transforms the game – <strong>for a time</strong>.</p>



<p>In Halloween Showdown, players must fight and kill special infected enemies to secure candies that they can use to unlock exclusive rewards from warring factions. The ‘special infected’ are the game’s normal enemies, but reimagined to suit the spooky Halloween season.</p>



<h2 id="h-halloween-hits-stay-human">Halloween Hits Stay Human</h2>



<p>In a recent release, the team at Techland revealed the arrival of the Dying Light 2 Halloween event, named Halloween Showdown. It’s set to run from today to November 20, giving users a fair window in which to unlock exclusive rewards.</p>



<p>Here’s a segment from that release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>The city of Villedor</strong>&nbsp;is fully decorated for Halloween, with returning themed enemies including Pumpkintiles, Witches, Scaregoons, Virals, and Biters. In Tower Raid, Halloween-themed enemies take over the Tower, with new decorations, layouts, and rooftop battles. Players can also unlock new characters like Cursed Pirate and the permanent Tower Raid character CyberRaider, while the updated reward track offers Toxic and UV weapons and a new scoreboard for competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This new Dying Light 2 event goes hand-in-hand with some featured community maps, themed around Halloween, being pushed by Techland. From November 13, limited bounties will unlock across these experiences, allowing players to grind for more rewards outside of the base game.</p>



<p>As you can also imagine, the special event also brings about some themed Halloween Bundles, which include one with a futuristic rifle that promises to ‘defy gravity’.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Dying Light 2: Stay Human? Let me know if you’re going to participate in the Halloween Showdown on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-1-3-patch-notes%E2%80%94new-enemy-behavior-and-fixes.1339468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast continues to be a success more than a month after the game hit the market. Players are still neck-deep in the Call of the Beast challenge path, slaying the undead to their heart’s content. In a recent release, Techland explained what has been added in the new 1.3 patch for Dying Light: The Beast, including new enemy behavior, animations, and improvements.</p>



<p>It’s not an enormous list, but then again, it’s not an enormous game. If you’re interested in checking out the full patch notes for Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update, read on.</p>



<h2 id="h-full-patch-notes-for-dying-light-the-beast-1-3">Full Patch Notes For Dying Light: The Beast 1.3</h2>



<p>One of the best new features added in Dying Light: The Beast’s 1.3 update is a pacifist mechanic of sorts. When you point a firearm at enemies after downloading the 1.3 patch, you’ll notice that they might lay down their weapons and surrender rather than tangle with Kyle Crane.</p>



<p>Techland explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Dying Light was always about reactivity and making the world respond naturally to your every move. After hearing your requests, we’ve introduced a new human-enemy behavior – melee-weapon enemies will now recognize when you’re aiming a firearm at them and might decide to surrender rather than losing their life. Depending on your actions then this scenario can unfold in a number of ways, but we’ll leave them to you to discover.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team has also added nine new weapon execution animations, covering every type of melee weapon in the game.</p>



<p>Call of the Beast continues, and the campaign has moved on a notch with fresh challenges. As a collective, the community needs ot land 10 million shots to secure an exclusive car skin, and 20 million to unlock a limited edition rifle. This new challenge runs from today until next Thursday.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <strong>Dying Light: The Beast x PUBG Mobile </strong>crossover event kicks off tomorrow. You need to access the Dying Light Outpost page and activate the quest, which will trigger an event in-game that hands you a new quest. Once you’ve completed this quest line, you’ll have unlocked stacks of PUBG Mobile-themed items.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-bug-fixes-in-dying-light-the-beast">Latest Bug Fixes in Dying Light: The Beast</h2>



<p>Here’s the full list of bug fixes hitting Dying Light: The Beast in the 1.3 patch.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s long-rumored pets cosmetic, officially dubbed "sidekicks" by Epic Games, will finally see the light of day on November 1 when Fortnite's new Simpsons-themed mini-season begins. These sidekicks will be little pets that follow you around and do emotes and "react to the world around you," according to Epic.</p><p>The first sidekick will be a banana dog called Peels, which will be included in the Simpsons battle pass that launches November 1. Three more sidekicks will hit the item shop on November 7, including Bonesy the dog, which was on a pet back bling in a battle pass years ago in Chapter 1. Folks who have the original Bonesey back bling will receive the new sidekick version of Bonesy for free. We have no information about pricing yet.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593949"></a><figcaption>Take a look at the first wave of Fortnite sidekicks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4593949-fortnite-sidekicks.jpg"></figure><p>While all this sounds cool, there is a monkey's paw component to sidekicks as well. Each sidekick is customizable, but you can only design the way it looks--meaning the color of its skin, scales or fur, or whether it has horns, and other physical characteristics--a single time. If you want to make one that looks different, you'll have to buy a new copy, seemingly at full price. The idea with this is that each critter you design is a unique being. But there are other ways to customize your sidekicks without paying more. You'll unlock accessories for your sidekicks, like little hats and shirts, by running with them in the game. </p><p>Meanwhile, November 1 also marks the start of a month-long Fortnite x Simpsons event, which will take over Battle Royale with a new Springfield-themed island and a battle pass that includes Marge and Homer Simpson skins. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">There will be a live event on Saturday morning</a> to introduce the Simpsons collab, before the season begins on Saturday evening.</p>

                <p>Halloween is upon us, and Google is serving up a blast from the arcade past with a special 45th anniversary edition of Pac-Man. The game is fully playable right on the homepage, with our yellow hero having traded his usual neon maze for something a bit spookier: Eight eerie levels, including four haunted houses that each mirror the personality of their ghostly resident. </p><p>When Pac-Man first hit Japanese arcades in 1980, it was an instant cultural phenomenon. Designed by Toru Iwatani and inspired by a pizza missing a slice, the game stood out in an era dominated by space shooters. Its simple premise--gobble dots, dodge ghosts, and clear mazes--quickly became addictive fun that crossed borders and generations. The ghosts even had their own personalities and names (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde), setting a new standard for character design in gaming. </p><p>Last Halloween, Google took <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blast-ghosts-and-even-the-haunted-sun-with-this-years-halloween-google-doodle/1100-6527487/" data-ref-id="1100-6527487">mascot Momo the cat on a space adventure</a> where you had to take on ghosts and even a haunted sun. Google's interactive Doodles already has an impressive lineup, from the <a href="https://doodlecricket.github.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cricket match Doodle from 2017</a>, where you play as a cricket, to the <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/celebrating-50-years-of-kids-coding/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Coding for Carrots game</a> that let kids learn programming basics through a hopping bunny. Now, Pac-Man gets to join them in his tricky treat adventure. </p><p>You don't need a console or a quarter to play, just head to Google's homepage and click on the Doodle banner, then press start. The special Pac-Man Doodle will be live for 48 hours only, so grab your virtual candy bag and get ready to chase (or be chased by) some ghosts. You can also learn about past Doodles <a href="https://doodles.google/search/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>. </p>
