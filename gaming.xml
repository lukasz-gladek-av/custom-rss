            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-garden">Tiny Garden</a> is a puzzle game about planting flowers and crops you can then sell to buy seeds for new types of flowers and crops. That would be charming enough on its own, but your agricultural endeavours are set inside a Polly Pocket-style toy, with crops also able to be exchanged for furniture with which to decorate your diorama home. After blowing past its Kickstarter target, there's now a playable demo.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's only 20-minutes or so long, more of a "proof-of-concept" than a full demo, say the developers, with many unfinished features. It'll also only be available for the remainder of the Kickstarter pledge drive, which comes to an end on August 2nd.

<p>That said, I've just played it and I had fun. Plopping down plants to modify adjacent tiles, to irrigate soil or grow grass, and thus create platforms for planting new types of seeds, is a satisfying challenge. It reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concrete-jungle">Concrete Jungle</a>, which used a similar system as the underpinnings of a citybuilder.
</p>
<p>I'm also just in love with the presentation. I did not have Polly Pockets as a kid, or the so-called boy equivalent, Mighty Max, which swapped the makeup cases and domestic scenes for monster heads and creepy dungeons. We ignored such boneheaded gender essentialism with our own son and bought a sackful of old, secondhand Polly Pockets from eBay however, and he adored them. I must have spent dozens of hours hunched over them with him, acting out stories, our imaginations lit up by their intricate construction. 
</p>
<p>Matt beat me to covering Tiny Garden when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tiny-garden-plants-a-charming-cozy-farming-sim-inside-virtual-polly-pocket-toys">it launched on Kickstarter</a> earlier this month, but officially I'm writing about it again now because it's got a playable demo. Unofficially I'm writing about it so that I can say: a Polly Pocket mansion with a secret room behind a bookcase is infinitely cooler than a Mighty Max skull dungeon.</p>

This got a few more laughs, but mainly because at this point it seems the audience realized that, oh hey, this guy is trying to be funny.

And then, as if it sticking to a script where this line killed and the audience was laughing, Vance pointed out to the confused people and said: “I love you guys.” </p><p>What followed was a few seconds of one person clapping loudly and Vance laughing so much more.

                <p>Epic recently announced an unexpected collaboration with Tesla, the electric car company. Starting Tuesday, July 23, players will be able to drive a Cybertruck in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/"> Fortnite</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/"> Rocket League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The<a href="https://x.com/RocketLeague/status/1815386430710874530" rel="nofollow "> Rocket League</a> and<a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815386568263110908?t=KLQ6PtB8nv0z2Bm5Oq5yng&amp;s=19" rel="nofollow "> Fortnite X/Twitter accounts</a> posted teasers about what players can expect. The Rocket League collaboration looks to be a standard one for the game, as real-life and fictional cars have been released as premium DLC in the past.</p><p dir="ltr">But as for Fortnite, the collab could be anything, seeing as the most current season is heavily tied to vehicle combat. As of this writing, it's unclear if the Cybertruck will serve as a boss car or if it can be modified with weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Although these announcements may seem completely random at first, both games had <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1815084377535078540/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased a similar image</a> on its X/Twitter accounts of a tire mark across some white spray paint.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Epic has teamed up with a real-world car company. In Fortnite, players can purchase a Ferrari 296; in Rocket League, they can buy Aston Martin Valhalla, BMWs, and much more.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cybertruck's unusual, blocky looks have been compared to those of low-poly video game cars in the past, so its appearance in games seems fitting. The real-life version has been impacted by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tesla-cybertruck-recall-fourth-time-f3709f24063695bc231763fb07d7d700" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a number of recalls since it launched last year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This wasn't the only collaboration Epic has recently announced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/7th-sea-price-of-arrogance-is-first-major-campaign-for-pirates-ttrpg<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>7th Sea</em> book has been announced. Chaosium and Studio Agate's high-seas swashbuckling TTRPG will receive its first major official campaign. The campaign, called <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance, </em>is packed with world-spanning peril, danger, and exciting action.</p>
<h2>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance</em> is a 300-page adventure book. The campaign is broken up into three acts and contains different gameplay options. These include Paths, which lets Game Masters tailor the story to their favorite playstyle.</p>

<p>As for the adventure itself, it is described as a mix of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-great-circle-coming-in-2024-for-xbox-and-pc-details-and-gameplay" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sea-of-thieves-pirates-life-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em></a>, and <em>Treasure Island</em>. Adventurers will travel from Montaigne's imperial courts to the New World's jungles. The journey may hold priceless treasures, but seekers of fortune will do well to keep their pride in check. The price of arrogance is quite high on the seven seas.</p>
<p><em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance </em>won't be arriving in retail but through a Kickstarter campaign. According to Chaosium, the book is already written and illustrated; the campaign is there for players who want to pick up extras, which includes dedicated game master screens, maps, handouts, and storage boxes.</p>
<p>The book will also be available in two different collector's editions. The first is the Montaigne edition, which will feature alternative cover art. The second is the Pirate edition, which comes in black faux leather. The latter is similar to the collector's edition of the <em>7th Sea</em> Core Rulebook which was offered in its initial Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p>Lastly, the campaign will offer core books. Allowing curious players to get a taste of the freedom that is the pirate's life. These core books not only include gameplay mechanics, but worldbuilding details, illustrating different locations, nations, and organizations.</p>
<p>If you miss the <em>7th Sea The Price of Arrogance</em> Kickstarter campaign, it will be coming to retail stores in 2025. At the time of writing, the campaign has not gone live.</p>

Nintendo originally created only 26 of these gold cartridges as prizes for <em>Nintendo Power</em> magazine readers in 1990. They’re so hard to come by that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/2/5/5380924/nintendo-world-championships-cartridge-sells-for-100k-on-ebay">one sold on eBay for $100,088</a> a decade ago.</p><p>Hundreds of cartridges were created<strong> </strong>for the 1990 Nintendo World Championships, an event that toured the United States trying to find the country’s best gamers. Players competed for high scores in timed versions of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, <em>Tetris</em>, and <em>Rad Racer,</em> which were all bundled onto special cartridges featuring physical switches, allowing the games’ time limits to be modified. </p><p>Most of these cartridges featured standard gray NES shells, but 26 of them were upgraded with a shiny gold housing and given away to winners of <em>Nintendo Power</em> magazine’s “Player’s Poll Contest” that same year.</p><p>According to Goldin, this particular gold cartridge was the one awarded to Patrick King of Cheyenne, Wyoming, whose <a href="https://archive.org/details/Nintendo_Power_Issue001-Issue127/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20018%20November-December%201990/page/n103/mode/2up?view=theater">name appeared in volume 18 of <em>Nintendo Power</em></a>, along with the other Player’s Poll Contest winners. </p><p>These games were never sold in packaging, which partly explains why this particular cartridge, which appears worn and is missing its label, was given just a 4.0 grade by <a href="https://www.cgcgrading.com/en-US">CGC Grading</a>. (A grading of 10 would indicate mint condition.)</p><p>Despite the cartridge’s rough shape, bidding tonight will start at $10,000. According to the <a href="https://goldin.co/faq">FAQ page on the auction house’s website</a>, at that level, potential buyers will be prescreened to ensure they can pay up. That will help protect the cartridge’s unknown seller, but what about buyers? </p><p>Faking a rare cartridge like this and fooling CGC Grading would be a huge but profitable undertaking given the current demand for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24194869/nintendo-playstation-gaming-auction-rare-snes">rare retro games and hardware</a>. The easiest way to confirm that this one is legit is to win the auction and plug the cartridge into an actual NES, but that could end up being a budget-busting approach best left to deep-pocketed collectors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fighting game tournament EVO 2024 took place this weekend, an annual event marked by fierce competition between the best players in the world and several update announcements for just about every fighting game going.

<figcaption>Guilty Gear Strive season four announcement trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wqn_KZIZ7E" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Season four of Guilty Gear Strive will introduce a new Team Of 3 mode, new stages, a new character called Unika, two fighters returning from previous Guilty Gear games, Queen Dizzy and Venom, and Lucy from Edgerunners. It's out today, and it'll cost £23 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1384160/GUILTY_GEAR_STRIVE/">from Steam</a>. The base game is currently 50% reduced, meanwhile, at £18.49.
</p>
<p>I'm a big Cyberpunk fan, but I've only seen a couple episodes of Edgerunners and I have no particularly affection for Lucy. My interest here lies mainly in how stunning Guilty Gear Strive looks. It's the game I tuned into watch at this year's EVO, because although I have only a passing understanding of fighting games, and no ability to parse high level tournament play, its character design and animation are worth the effort of trying. I feel similarly about Studio Trigger, the Japanese animation studio behind Edgerunners and Lucy's character design. She doesn't seem to have heard of trousers or to know what belts are for, but I want to see her in Strive.
</p>
<p>Guilty Gear is getting its own anime. Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers is coming next year from Sanzigen Studio, and new character Unika is apparently a key character from the show. A teaser trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODo4fjcPkbI&amp;ab_channel=arcsystemworks">dropped a couple of weeks ago</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> development studio Player First Games has been acquired by the game's publisher, Warner Bros. The studio's co-founders will continue to lead the studio. The platform figher's second season is due to go live tomorrow, adding a ranked mode and new characters Samurai Jack and Beetlejuice. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Our team is excited to join the Warner Bros. Games family, and we feel that this will be great for MultiVersus overall. We are working to make the MultiVersus game experience the best it can be and having our development team integrated with the publisher is optimum for the players," said game director Tony Huynh in a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-games-multiversus-player-first-games-acquisition">sent to IGN</a>.
</p>
<p>MultiVersus is a free-to-play, live service brawler that draws its roster of characters from across Warner Bros. properties, from Looney Tunes to DC superheroes, Adventure Time to Rick &amp; Morty. It's had a protracted development so far, launching in open beta back in 2022, postponing its first season of updates in response to feedback, then going offline entirely in early 2023 for re-tooling.
</p>
<p>It returned on May 28th of this year, with revamped art, new characters and levels, and a PvE mode. We haven't paid it much mind around here since, although we liked the initial beta well enough. Our cousins over at Eurogamer were less kind towards the relaunch, calling it a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-is-a-smash-bros-clone-that-feels-like-a-smartphone-game-spoiled-by-its-monetisation">Smash Bros. derivative spoiled by its monetisation</a>.
</p>
<p>I like Smash Bros. a good amount, both as a knockabout couch experience and as baby's-first-fighting-game to play with my kid. It's nice MultiVersus is an entry in the genre that's available on PC, but I can't imagine ditching Nintendo's take for a microtransaction treadmill with characters like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-smash-bros-fighter-multiversus-adds-friday-the-13ths-jason-and-the-matrixs-agent-smith-to-its-already-preposterous-roster">Jason from Friday The 13th</a>.</p>

            <p>
Just weeks after Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">major Xbox Game Pass shakeup</a>, a new report claims the company is mulling over a variety of additional subscription tiers in a bid to expand the service's reach, including a tier offering access to the Game Pass catalogue exclusively via cloud gaming.
</p>
<p>
That's according Windows Central's Jez Corden who, in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan">lengthy article</a> discussing Game Pass' future, claims to have heard from sources that Microsoft's is "working towards" a cloud-only version that would be "cheaper and more approachable" than Game Pass Ultimate.
</p>
<p>
The aim is said to be two-fold, with Microsoft hoping the tier will appeal to those put off by the upfront costs of a console, as well as to existing owners of competing consoles who don't want to buy an Xbox but might find the Game Pass catalogue appealing. It's reportedly also intending to monetise the cloud-only service further by offering digital ownership of individual games in its catalogue, should a user wish to buy something outright.

<p> 
Furthermore, it seems Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass Friends and Family Plan experiment isn't dead either, based on what Corden calls "very tentative" rumours. A version of the plan, which would enable five people to share access to Game Pass Ultimate at a significant discount, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-preview-ends-next-month-microsoft-confirms">trialled between September 2022 and August 2023</a>, but it never progressed to a worldwide release. Additionally, Corden says one initiative Microsoft had previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-may-be-introducing-cheaper-ad-supported-xbox-game-pass-tiers">hinted it was considering</a> - an ad-based tier for Xbox Game Pass - isn't something it's "actively working towards" right now. </p>
<p>
Talk of further expansions to Microsoft's existing Xbox Game Pass tiers comes just two weeks after the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">confirmed sweeping changes</a> to its subscription service in the run-up to October's launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. These changes included the removal of day one releases for its overhauled basic tier, plus price increases across the board.
</p>
<p>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ftc-slams-microsofts-xbox-game-pass-tier-changes-calls-it-a-degraded-product">slammed Microsoft's revised Game Pass tiers</a> in a filing with the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, calling the new offering a "degraded product" and "exactly the sort of consumer harm from the [Activision Blizzard] merger the FTC has alleged". In response, Microsoft told the court the FTC's claims were "wrong" and "misleading", insisting the agency "barely mentioned [concerns about] subscription[s] at trial".
</p>
<p>
Away from the drama, Microsoft has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-leads-day-one-releases-still-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-july">strong month of additions for Xbox Game Pass</a>, with July bringing the likes of Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn , Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dungeons of Hinterberg, Flock, The Case of the Golden Idol, Neon White, and more.

He pounds down a bottle of pills, takes a swig of alcohol from his flask (while another unopened bottle of moonshine sits in the background), gets sad about his dead wife, and talks about being a disgraced detective who plays fast and loose with the law. This all happens before he gets a call from the police chief letting him know that he’s getting reinstated for a high-profile case. I love it.<br></p><p><em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, from developer Critical Hit Games, is a loving homage to classic noir films. Sure, the game is set in a retro-futuristic New York City full of floating cars and science that makes people live forever, but at its core it’s just a pulpy crime thriller. It doesn’t subvert the tropes of the genre and it’s better for it, instead opting to be a fun, tropey mystery that plays it all incredibly straight. Critical Hit has built a wonderfully gritty noir world here, one that’s worth spending time in.</p><figure id="" data-id="d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-recommend-id="image://d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PLAION</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-recommend-id="image://d45cd42a6ec81f655a56374153de5ed4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A large foyer with two staircases and a tree in the middle burn down" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The crime that kicks off the story is the death of a man named Green, responsible for this futuristic city’s biggest achievement: immortality. In <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, people are able to transfer their consciousness between bodies. Even when your body dies, you can just buy a new one, though it isn’t cheap. Now Green is dead, and the killer did the job so well he won’t get a chance to come back. From here, the five-to-six hour tale sprints towards its conclusion. That short runtime is a godsend, as it feels perfectly fit for the pulpy adventure.<br></p><p>As disgraced but temporarily reinstated detective James Karra, you go to a series of crime scenes in order to unravel a grand conspiracy. What starts as an apparent suicide quickly becomes something more sinister, with the entire upper echelon of New York society somehow involved. In this regard, <em>Nobody Wants to Die </em>is doing its own take on noir classics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Chinatown</em></a></span>, and it works really well. Of course this story has the added element of sci-fi detective tools, so Karra gets to rewind crime scenes to reconstruct what happened. This is the main thing you’ll be doing: scrubbing backwards and forwards through the events of a crime in search of clues that help you piece together exactly what happened. </p><p>There are a handful of other tools at your disposal (a UV lamp to see old blood trails, an X-ray to find secret compartments, etc.) but the gameplay itself is fairly straightforward and hand-holdy. I don’t actually have a problem with that, as each clue is primarily an excuse for Karra and his partner Sara to talk through the case and its particulars, giving you new information. You’re given just enough to do to feel occupied without focus being pulled from the main draw, the elaborate mystery at the game’s center. Most of my time at crime scenes was spent listening attentively to dialogue and trying to wrap my head around the case.<br></p><p>Crime scenes are also <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>’s most stunning moments to just look at. That is true even with the game’s first big set piece, a massive penthouse with a grand staircase and a huge cherry tree in the center of it all. When you first get there the entire room is ablaze, including the tree. As you reconstruct the timeline, you can rewind and watch the flames flicker and die down in reverse as color comes back into the tree’s leaves. It’s pretty spectacular. A floating bar and a secret sex club also make appearances, and each one is a delightful playground to walk around in, even if it’s just to look at all the details while listening to dialogue. That dialogue is also wonderfully written. Karra and Sara do the bulk of the talking, and they constantly hit on noir tropes without making them seem tired.</p><figure id="" data-id="4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-recommend-id="image://4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PLAION</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-recommend-id="image://4244e7bb3346796e8941206ae9f8fcfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A mustachioed man stabs another man under him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That visual splendor extends to the rest of <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em>, it’s part of its very essence. The entire world of the game is built on a stunning aesthetic that blends 40’s flare with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-remake-rerelease-pc-steam-1849111500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blade-runner-enhanced-edition-remake-rerelease-pc-steam-1849111500"><em>Blade Runner</em></a></span> grit. It’s a mashup of art deco decor and purely industrial metal. It’s incredibly evocative just on sight, in much the same way that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/there-s-always-a-lighthouse-there-s-always-bioshock-sw-1843763314&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/there-s-always-a-lighthouse-there-s-always-bioshock-sw-1843763314"><em>BioShock</em></a></span>’s Rapture is. The path through the world you take is just as directed as the gameplay segments at crime scenes, but it never feels constricting thanks to the incredible level of detail in every space you do get to explore. Everything in <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> has a place in a larger tapestry, be that the conspiracy you are trying to solve or the city of New York itself. The game’s ending (or endings, since there are multiple) don’t quite tie up all the fascinating threads and world-building with the same excellent execution as the rest of the narrative, but it didn’t put too sour of a taste in my mouth. I had a good ride, even if the finale was a bit lackluster.<br></p><p>What surprised me most in my time with <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> was its deep lore. The premise of a future without death isn’t just a shallow idea that starts the mystery, it’s a moral and ethical quandary that Critical Hit Games investigates at every turn. In 2329 New York, we hear talk of bodies as literal government property. That’s as horrific an idea as you would imagine, and the game digs into this with further details like drinking and smoking being illegal so as to not ruin a body for its next owner, a subscription fee you must pay to use your body, and the emergence of a new death kink for rich people who can afford to buy poor bodies and take them over just to get killed in for a quick high before returning to their old body. It’s a biting allegory of wealth inequality and how rich people see poor people as a literal commodity to control. Learning more about this world is one of the best parts of <em>Nobody Wants to Die</em> and the flavor text you can find is full of interesting tidbits that only add to your understanding of the crimes at its center. This game came out of nowhere for me, but its tightly paced film noir mystery is built on such a fascinating world that it’s quickly become one of my favorite sleeper hits of 2024.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What sets <em>Cataclismo</em> apart isn’t necessarily what you build but <em>how</em> you build it. While buildings like homes and barracks are standard, pre-made units, walls, towers, and bridges for crossing the game’s fractured world are all constructed individually block-by-block. And because maps are so dense, the most efficient way to build up a settlement while also keeping it secure is to expand upwards instead of outwards. The result often looks like dark fantasy shanty town held up by a labyrinth of stone walls and wooden scaffolding. Maybe this sounds tedious to you. I promise it’s not.<br></p><p>I mentioned air purifiers earlier. Clean air is a key resource in <em>Cataclismo</em>. Buildings need it. Soldiers need it. And researching upgrades also requires a big chunk. Capturing it requires building an air purifier high enough off the ground that you get as much air harvested per minute as possible. Building it high off the ground means creating a tall block of wood scaffolding and, because all buildings must be accessible to ambient workers controlled automatically by your settlement in order to produce resources, it also needs a staircase that reaches all the way to the top. You get to control all of this by linking together each individual piece, which clicks into place with the satisfying precision (most of the time) and sound not unlike actual Lego.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e3ad9bb81ed0de9281e4be9165bd43a0" data-recommend-id="image://e3ad9bb81ed0de9281e4be9165bd43a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wall stands tall in a post-apocalyptical landscape.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That’s the most basic example, but stone walls follow a similar logic. It’s not enough just to build them thick and tall, they also need spots for your archers to stand on, places for merlons, flags, and other castle accoutrements to adorn and buff your armies. Build stone windows and you get to stack multiple lines of archers. But then you also need to make the stairs for them to get up there, and make sure they’re not so close to the action that they fall and tumble to their death if and when the Horrors start chewing through the outer layers of your defenses.<br></p><p>The third leg of this is trying hard to maximize the space you have by stacking everything as close together as possible. Homes and barracks have stone roofs you can build on top of. Wood and stone arches let you build your base into mini-cathedrals that feel like <em>King Arthur</em> meets <em>Blade Runner</em>. And the myriad other buildings, technologies, and unit types (which I’ve only begun to explore the latter stages of in my playthroughs) build on that fantasy and the satisfaction of grafting together short-term and unwieldy medieval city planning solutions into a community that manages, against all odds, to repel the darkness each night.</p><figure id="" data-id="fae7a77654c3ded49a75394a4fa437fe" data-recommend-id="image://fae7a77654c3ded49a75394a4fa437fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Horrors storm the castle walls.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a solid formula I would confidently recommend to anyone who likes strategy games and even some people who don’t. But <em>Cataclismo</em> is also tailor-made to worm its way into my head and make me obsessed. As a kid, before <em>Game of Thrones</em> even existed, I was building massive walls in my bedroom patrolled by army men who used an elevator made out of my erector set to carry them up to the top level. At the beach I didn’t just make towering drippy sand castles surrounded by sea walls, I also separated them into districts and carved out sewers for drainage. I have spent many hours with my kids stacking Duplo blocks into Jenga-like towers held up by precarious staircases and stilts, searching for the invisible point between something breaking and it being strong enough to survive.<br></p><p><em>Cataclismo</em> channels a bit of each of those experiences into a well-balanced strategy game where planning and building is often even more rewarding than watching battles you’ve spent so much time preparing for play out. It takes a lot of what worked so well in <em>They Are Billions</em> and adds a whole new layer of verticality to the proceedings. The shift makes for a more aesthetically interesting city builder where creativity and self-expression have as much of a role in the decision-making as simply trying to min-max resources and defensive capabilities. </p><p>I’m not sure if <em>Cataclismo</em> will ultimately have the same legs in terms of combat and tactics in its latter stages that that game had. For now though, its Early Access journey is off to a great start. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</li></ul><p><strong>UI</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Revised and reorganised the in-game video options to be more logical and robust. You now have an Upscaling Type drop-down, an Upscaling Mode drop-down, and an Upscaling Sharpness slider, followed immediately by the options that are affected by them.</li><li>Updated the Reactions UI so that you only have to toggle the Reactions you want to use and then confirm them. (This saves you from having to select 'Do not react' multiple times!)</li><li>Added a new Equipment Options menu to the Character Sheet on controller.</li><li>The panel that opens to 'Donate' magic items to Gale will now also show items in your Traveller's Chest. It also now indicates which items are currently equipped.</li><li>We noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called 'Use' instead of 'Consume'.</li><li>Fixed your player character's name getting reverted to 'Custom' during Character Creation if you moved on to create your Dream Guardian and then went back to edit the player character again.</li><li>Fixed the wrong spell Ability showing up when selecting a Feat during Level Up.
</li></ul><p><strong>Art</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added a new loading screen in Act III, showing the busy streets of Baldur's Gate.</li><li>Fixed the skirt part of the Adamantine Splint Armour missing for female dwarves.</li><li>Fixed the Adamantine Scale Mail clipping on large male characters.
</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>You can now start Custom Mode games using Honour Mode mechanics when starting a new playthrough. You'll be able to do this via the 'Ruleset' dropdown.</li><li>The kuo-toa that promised to build you an army will now support you in the final battle. Unless they all died in Act I.</li><li>The help that the Gondians promised for the final battle will now arrive in the form of a friendly Steel Watcher. Apologies from Zanner Toobin for the delay.</li><li>The hair colour options in Character Creation will now remain accessible after you choose the bald hairstyle, so that you can continue fiddling around with eyebrow colours.</li><li>Overhead dialogues that support multiple player characters can now involve characters assigned to different players. (They were limited to characters controlled by a single player until now.) This means that there will be more banter among player characters in multiplayer games.</li><li>Group Hide will no longer affect summons that aren't linked to the group in the Party Line.</li><li>Changed the behaviour for selecting camp supplies for a Long Rest. When selecting camp supplies that are stacked, the game now only takes what it needs from the stack.</li><li>You can no longer cheese the Leap of Faith trial at the Gauntlet of Shar by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there. Shar threatened to smite us if we didn't fix this one.</li><li>Fixed a bug where resurrecting Lae'zel on the beach in Act I would cause her to appear in the Party Line but not in the world, preventing you from leaving Act I.</li><li>Patched up some savegames where Gale still had his Necrotic Aura when he shouldn't on load.</li><li>Fixed Minthara's body sometimes turning invisible on the Level Up screen. (We sorta liked the floating-head-and-hands look, but hey.)
</li></ul><p><strong>Animation</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Astarion now has idle animations at camp that aren't just him reading a book.</li><li>Added a new idle animation for Minsc at camp - Boo may or may not have taught him some tai chi.</li><li>Karlach will no longer brush the shaved side of her head.</li><li>Polished the appearance of neck kisses in lovey-dovey scenes with Shadowheart on the Sharran path for characters with large body types and dragonborn characters.
</li></ul><p><strong>Writing and Flow</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Dotted some dialogue options and voiced lines into dialogues across the game to add some more overall reactivity, particularly to account for edge-case flows.</li><li>Dotted more Dark Urge reactivity (dialogue options and Narrator lines) into dialogues across the game.</li><li>Resolved an issue that had been rendering some romance party banters inaccessible while adventuring.</li><li>Avatar Lae'zel can now decide what she wants to do at the end of the game  even if she wasn't the avatar making the choices in the main dialogue.</li><li>Added a dialogue option asking for a kiss in more paths of Wyll's epilogue dialogue.</li><li>If you're in holographic form in the epilogue, Wyll won't automatically assume he's talking to Lae'zel.</li><li>Gave Wyll a new greeting for romance partners in Act III and characters with really low approval.</li><li>Companions should now be more sympathetic to Astarion fleeing from the sun.</li><li>Added a new dialogue in which Karlach will react to Dammon if she finds him dead after he told her that he can help her.</li><li>Minthara will now react if you knock her out in Act I.
</li></ul><p><strong>Scripting</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed several issues (related to resurrecting characters via Withers, restructuring the party at night, and automatic camp night scenes) that would trap you in an eternal slumber, unable to end a Long Rest.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing Shadowheart to keep repeating one line when you talk to her after she's resurrected by Withers from the Shadowfell.</li><li>Fixed a small flow issue preventing you from commenting on Gale's last name.</li><li>Fixed several occurrences of Wyll still having an exclamation mark above his head when he already told you everything he had to say.</li><li>When playing as the Dark Urge, Minthara will no longer act as though you accepted Bhaal when </li><li>Fixed a broken kissing scene after you gave Shadowheart the Idol of Shar.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Jaheira would stop following the party after spending a night outside of the party.</li><li>Fixed the rune tablets on the nautiloid sometimes not triggering the Narrator's lines.</li><li>Clerics of Lathander should now recognise his symbol on a Lathanderian amulet.</li><li>Ensured the avatar is prioritised as the main speaker in dialogues related to the hag's Act I surrender.</li><li>Minthara does, in fact, now have something to say about  after you kill her.</li><li>Made the romance scene at night with Wyll in Act III unskippable if it triggers to avoid accidentally skipping it and not being able to finish the romance arc.</li><li>If Avatar Karlach and Wyll are partners and go to  together, he'll now act accordingly during the epilogue.</li><li>Fixed Karlach's scene  not playing if you decided to go with her when playing as Wyll.</li><li>A bug has been fixed so that Wyll will now talk to his father if  after the pact with Mizora is broken but Ravengard is saved from  despite this, to decide on his title.</li><li>Lae'zel will now wait a little longer for you at the site of her recruitment if you tell her you'll be back.</li><li>Improved Lae'zel's idle camp behaviours to align a bit better with the other companions'.</li><li>Fixed the fade-to-black after Karlach's scene  at the end of the game, which would give you a very brief glimpse of Game Developer Land.</li><li>Breaking up with Karlach by speaking with another companion you're dating the morning after her romance scene won't block her dialogue anymore.</li><li>Reinstated Gale's last line in his detailed explanation of ceremorphosis and tweaked a dialogue option to react to it.</li><li>Now that you can give Gale magic items from the Traveller's Chest, he will leave again if you refuse to do so.</li><li>Patched up some savegames that had a bug that would prevent the dialogue between Gale and  at the end of the game from triggering.</li><li>Fixed a bug that let you kiss Gale even if he was in a disguised form before confronting . Also fixed this dialogue with him cutting off before you could give him a smooch.</li><li>Reworked the script that determines whether a character is too busy to talk. This will prevent bugs like Minthara's dialogue not triggering at Moonrise Towers after you rescue her, and knock-on effects as a result of this, like not being able to rest or fast travel.
</li></ul><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Continued to make performance and stability optimisations across the game and implemented many under-the-hood code fixes.</li><li>Optimised performance. This will have a more noticeable impact in areas with large numbers of NPCs (like the Lower City) and will reduce peak memory usage when loading levels for the first time. It will also be noticeable when managing lots of loot (e.g. when transferring everything from a camp chest to a character's inventory).
</li></ul><p><strong>Cinematics</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reworked and revamped the cutscene that plays when you interact with </li><li>Polished facial expressions and emotions across companion dialogues, including to the facial animations of your character during some kissing cinematics, including with the  Astarion.</li></ul><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Sources at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> say that Microsoft is looking into adding more tiers to Xbox Game Pass, including ad-based  and cloud-only options.</p>



<p>First, regarding the cloud-only tier, this would reportedly be a cheaper tier where you wouldn’t need to own an Xbox console. You’d just need a platform that can access cloud-based games on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>“This would be designed around users who simply aren’t interested in buying an Xbox console, which could include competing console platform players,” the report says. “It could also be for users who don’t like the upfront costs of owning any console whatsoever.”</p>



<p>As far as the ad-based tier is concerned, the report stats that Microsoft has been “exploring the potential” of one. However, there are no plans to launch an ad-based tier at this moment.</p>







<p>Lastly, the report mentions a possibility of the return of a Family and Friends plan for the service. Originally, Microsoft tested the idea back in 2022 and 2023. That test <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was available in various regions</a>, charging $24.99 per month for up to five people to access a single subscription.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the latest reports. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft made <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large changes to current tiers</a>, including scrapping Xbox Game Pass Console in favor of the new, more expensive, Xbox Game Pass Standard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/22/everything-we-know-about-dragon-age-the-veilguards-bellara-lutara<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>We've reached the end of <em>Game Informer's</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story coverage as we prepare to launch our next exciting issue. But I still have this one last feature to publish, and it's about Bellara Lutara, the Dalish elf and member of the new Veil Jumpers faction in the game. During my visit to BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year, I checked out <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/27/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">the game's expansive character creator</a>, its in medias res prologue, and the first mission after said prologue.</p>

<p>Though BioWare released a big look at Veilguard's prologue via a <a href="https://youtu.be/CTNwHShylIg?si=tvYCaZjeSa-qkIRQ">20-minute gameplay trailer</a>&nbsp;last month, they haven't released much about that subsequent mission, where you meet and recruit your first companion, Bellara. I learned a lot about this character, and knowing I was one of the first outside of the studio to see the mission where you meet her, I spent a chunk of my interviews with the team's leads talking about Bellara. So, for my final feature on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, here's everything I learned about this quirky elven mage.&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4d623755-9990-44d2-a36d-35750b45dd9a" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>In talking with BioWare's various leads, like game director Corinne Bushce, creative director John Epler (who is personally responsible for writing Bellara and leading her development), and BioWare general manager Gary McKay, it's clear the team has a deep love for this character. She's energetic, effervescent, and academic, and as a companion for combat, she's a character I’m pretty excited to use in my party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love Bellara, I think she's fantastic," McKay tells me. "I see people that I know in her and so that's how she really resonates with me. I love the whole tinkerer aspect to her. It was a collective to bring that character to life. It was everything from the writers, to the editors, the animators, to character modelers, to the texturing, to how we light her. I'm really proud of that character."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bellara In Combat</h3>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="3e786997-2974-482d-828b-1299d2d83245" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>When I ask Busche about Bellara, she gives me some insight into what I can expect of the mage on the battlefield. And Bellara sounds like an excellent choice for both support and elemental combos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Oh my goodness, she is amazing," Busche says. "So, first of all, she is a mage. She is an explorer of ancient Elven ruins. She is an elf herself and a member of the Veil Jumpers faction. They investigate the ancient ruins of Arlathan. Everything about her character as a mage leans into that, but she also challenges the kind of archetypal idea of a mage."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She does that by attacking with a bow at range using electrically charged arrows. But she's also casting spells that slow down time or heal allies and Rook. She does that by channeling magical energy into her gauntlet. Busche says she starts as a support character in combat, thanks to her healing spells, but notes players don't have to build her out that way. She also leans into electrical damage, and "damage type really matters a lot when we get into the strategy and tactics," Busche says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can spec her out in a way where she's unleashing this devastating vortex that pulls in all enemies into an electrical storm. Maybe then we unleash our own [area of effect attack] with all the enemies clumped together," Busche adds. "She can debuff all the enemies with the shocked affliction, where they're taking passive damage. I mentioned she can slow time, she can heal. She is one of the characters that you can build out [to have her] healing spells heal you autonomously, so if you're the kind of player that likes to be on the frontlines [...] Bellara might just be the perfect companion for you."&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Bellara's Place In The World</h3>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="97849e01-d981-4fe5-91ce-033aefbd8201" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Epler, who writes Bellara, tells me about her place in Thedas as an elf and the connection elves have to the magic of the world. He says if you've paid attention to the franchise, you likely already know that elves are historically an oppressed people in the games. Now, with two of their gods on the loose in Veilguard, magic has poured back into the world in a big way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"She represents the Veil Jumpers," Epler explains. "Now, the Veil Jumpers are a faction that's appeared in the comics before, but otherwise, this is the first time it's appeared in the games, and they are the ones journeying through Arlathan, where the ancient elven empire used to exist and left a lot of artifacts when it disappeared. When the elves fell from immortality thousands of years ago, they still left a lot of their artifacts and a lot of their, for lack of a better term, magical technology behind, and Bellara represents this yearning to find the truth of who the elves were because not only did they lose their magic and their immortality, they lost a lot of their history.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A lot of what they know of their past is based on myth, it's based on rumor. Bellara is a knowledge seeker. She wants to find out what's true, what's not; she wants to find the pieces of who the elves used to be and really understand what their story was, where they came from, as well as figure out where they're going next, and find a future for the elves. And within the context of The Veilguard, she joins the team, first of all, to help stop the gods because Bellara feels at least partially responsible since they are elven gods, but also to maybe find a little bit more of who they used to be. Because again, you're dealing with these elves that were around millennia ago that have now reemerged into the world, and who better to teach her who the elves used to be than them."</p>

<h3>A Quick Detour: Magic</h3>

<p>For one of my last questions to Epler, I was curious about the contrast between Bellara, an elven mage who is optimistic and bubbly, and Solas, a determined and tragic character. He indicated there might be more to Bellara than meets the eye.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c645d6c8-af4e-403e-add8-a624bb426fd0" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"Solas sees himself as the tragic hero," Epler says. "He's not capable of really being happy, he can't let himself be happy, partially because he carries the guilt of what he did bringing the Veil, doing what he did to the world. Whereas Bellara is somebody who has seen tragedy, and as you get into her character arc and get into her backstory, you realize this is a character who has seen a lot of tragedy. But that tragedy, instead of wallowing in it, she's forced herself to push past it. She looks at her regrets, and she tells herself, 'I don't want to feel regret.'</p>

<p>"Whereas again, Solas tends to wallow in his to a large degree. And it allows us to create a very big differentiation. Part of it is also because Solas is an ancient elf, whereas Bellara is a Dalish elf, but she just sees a problem and wants to solve it. She feels a tremendous amount of responsibility to her people [...] to the Dalish, and to the Veil Jumpers, and that drives her forward. That said, she does have her moments where she has doubt, she has moments where she has a more grim outlook, and there are moments where you realize that some of her sunny, optimistic outlook is kind of a mask that she puts on to hide the fact that she's hurting, she's in pain. But in general, she doesn't see any benefit to wallowing in those regrets."</p>

<p>We learned today that Bellara will be voiced by Jee Young Han, known for her roles in&nbsp;<em>Perry Mason,</em>&nbsp;<em>Unprisoned,</em>&nbsp;and as Sentinel Dax in a previous Bioware game, Anthem.
