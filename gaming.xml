            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-most-funded-tcg-kickstarter-ever-is-coming-to-retail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In January, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-tcg-kickstarter-raises-over-1-million-in-day">Kickstarter campaign</a> for the Altered TCG went live. This new card game became the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-tcg-ends-kickstarter-as-most-funded-tcg-ever">successful card game project</a> ever on the platform, raising over $6.7 million. Now the developers have announced an official <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release.</p>
<h2>The Altered TCG Retail announcement</h2>
<p>According to a report by ICV2, Asmodee Group will be handling distribution for the Altered TCG retail release. This TCG features a colorful fantasy world. Players build a deck based around one of the setting's factions, and games are represented not as wizard duels but as fast-paced races across the setting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-retail-store-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=DF21zXBe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-retail-store-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=Uf6Dbh9C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game mats, markets, and standees will be coming as well.</figcaption></figure><p>The innovation of the <em>Altered TCG</em> comes from its print-on-demand system for cards. If you own a single copy of a card, that card can be linked to an account in a marketplace app. You can freely and legally print additional copies through this app for a small fee. This right can be traded to other players through the app.</p>
<p>Compared to other TCGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <em>Pokemon TCG</em>, card games that drive engagement through limited prints of cards like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/logan-paul-sets-most-expensive-pokemon-card-purchase-world-record">Pikachu variants</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-one-ring-card-has-been-found">The One Ring</a>, this is a major departure in business model.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> was designed by Régis Bonnessée (Seasons, Dixit, Fabula), and was developed by French studio Equinox. The distribution of the game through Asmodee Group is part of an exclusive <a href="https://corporate.asmodee.com/news/asmodee-equinox-announce-exclusive-partnership-for-global-distribution-of-innovative-trading-card-game-altered-featuring-gamegenic-as-sole-gaming-accessories-partner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global distribution partnership</a> that was announced in November 2023.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release will be broken into two SKUs. The first SKU is booster displays. Each booster display will contain 36 packs. Each pack contains 12 cards. On average, each display will contain 36 hero cards, 288 commons, 100 rares, and 4 or 5 unique cards. These displays will be sold at an MSRP of $143.64.</p>
<p>The second SKU is starter deck displays. These displays will contain six different faction decks. Each deck contains 40 cards, a rule leaflet, 5 adventure cards, 2 reminder cards, a foil card, and some markers. The starter deck display will be sold at an MSRP of $89.94.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release date is September 13. The booster displays, starter deck displays, and several themed accessories can be pre-ordered from Asmodee's store page.</p>

Now, GuliKit is officially bringing its drift-resistant magnetic Hall effect joysticks to a PS5, PS4, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch Pro gamepad near you in the form of upcoming upgrade kits. </p><p>They’ll be available for the Sony DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox Series gamepad, and Nintendo’s own official Switch Pro controller. But surprisingly, GuliKit is no longer bringing it to Sony’s modular DualSense Edge<em> </em><a href="https://x.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1617344363218243585?lang=en">like it originally promised</a> and won’t offer it for Xbox Elite controllers, either. GuliKit business director Jack He tells me that’s because neither Sony nor Microsoft offer working calibration tools for their flagship gamepads. (Hall effect joysticks do need to be calibrated before first use and periodically afterward.)</p><div><figcaption><em>GuliKit says its stick has less error than the originals.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: GuliKit</cite></p></div><p>Instead of producing a drop-in Hall effect module for the DualSense Edge, He suggests that “players can use this new stick to install on the stick module,” presumably soldering it in themselves if Sony adds a calibration tool to the PS5.</p><p>Speaking of soldering, that might be a required skill for these other gamepads, too. While GuliKit’s Steam Deck and Joy-Con sticks are attached with screws and are easy to remove, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all tend to solder their ALPS potentiometer joysticks directly to their gamepad circuit boards, as you can see in <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Pro+Controller+Joystick+Module+Replacement/127716#:~:text=Turn%20to%20the%20backside%20of%20the%20circuit%20board%20for%20clear%20access%20to%20the%20solder%20joints.">iFixit’s</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Sony+DualSense+Controller+Joystick+Cover+Replacement/142063">many</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Xbox+Series+X+Wireless+Controller+Disassembly/146815">guides</a>.</p><p>GuliKit’s He wouldn’t provide other details, prices, or any release dates at this point but tells me these new sticks are “a very new patented technology which is different from our current hall effect joystick.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546851/nyxi-wizard-nintendo-switch-driftless-gamecube-controller-hall-effect">manufacturers</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23841614/hyperkin-competition-xbox-controller-hall-effect-drift-free-sticks-playstation-announcement-specs">have </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">begun to adopt</a> drift-resistant joysticks in their premium controllers and handhelds, many if not all of which are supplied by GuliKit, though others (including Valve) say they believe their existing ALPS sticks are good enough. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">With the ROG Ally X, Asus is trying to hedge its bets</a>; it’ll ship with ALPS sticks rated for 5 million rotations, but Asus also worked with GuliKit to offer a Hall effect upgrade kit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24177805/league-of-legends-ahri-bans-immortalized-legend-skin</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ahri-ban-rate-soars-after-ultra-expensive-new-league-of-legends-skin-drops.900897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177805/league-of-legends-ahri-bans-immortalized-legend-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Sefah1"><em>League of Legends</em>’ latest skin has proven controversial with the community. The Immortalized Legend Ahri skin was designed to commemorate Faker as the first pro player inducted into <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/29658317853587-League-of-Legends-Hall-of-Legends-2024">Riot’s <em>League of Legends</em> esports Hall of Fame,</a> called the <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">Hall of Legends</a>. To mark the occasion, the skin has an optional extra tier that costs about $500 to unlock. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167467/league-of-legends-risen-legend-ahri-bundle-fan-reaction">many fans objected to the price tag online right away</a>, their displeasure has now moved in-game, with Ahri’s ban rate suddenly skyrocketing after her new skin’s release. </p>
<p id="k2XwmZ">The skin arrived in patch 14.12, which hit servers on Wednesday. Since then, Ahri has gone from being banned in about 8% of ranked games to being banned in over 15% of ranked games, according to <a href="https://lolalytics.com/lol/ahri/build/?region=na">Lolalytics</a>. While the uptick in bans is true globally, it’s most pronounced in North America, going from around 10% to over 23%, suggesting that either NA players hate this skin a little bit more than the rest of the world, or the region’s ranked players are more committed to sending a message than ranking up — a theory that the region’s Worlds results certainly back up. </p>
<p id="llRA0C">This type of change in bans is usually reserved for champions who get substantial in-game buffs, or with enormously high win rates, but neither is true for Ahri. In this case, it really seems to be all about the skin — which gives no practical in-game bonuses unless you count opulence and pride as psychological buffs.</p>
<p id="zM9gFh">With no meaningful buffs, this admittedly funny banning trend is likely to correct itself in the near future, which means that soon enough <em>League</em>’s biggest spenders will get to show off their shiny new skin. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-on-fable%E2%80%99s-release-date.900894/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Despite being shown at the Xbox Game Showcase last weekend, it doesn’t appear that the release date for Fable is all that close. </p>



<p>Despite the game’s release window <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-gets-new-trailer-and-release-window-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being confirmed for 2025</a>, it’s not going to be in the early part of the year. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177703/microsoft-xbox-game-showcase-windows-recall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge</a>, Microsoft is aiming for a release date between October and December 2025 for Fable. That would put it during the Holiday shopping season for next year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify this information regarding the Fable release. However, Tom is one of the more reliable reporters with accurate information.</p>



<p>Fable is a reboot of the classic franchise that made its debut on the original Xbox in 2004. The game features a brand new story with new characters to meet.</p>



<p>“What does it mean to be a Hero? Well, in the fairytale land of Albion, that is entirely up to you,” the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s description reads</a>. “With a dark threat looming, and in a world where your reputation precedes you, your choices will change Albion forever.”</p>



<p>When it releases, Fable will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PC. It will also be available day one on Game Pass.</p>

You must contribute 2 Invitations to the challenge to complete it, so hop into Trials and start completing objectives to earn them. <ul> <li data-index="3"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Show ’em What You Got</strong>: As a community, activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 million times. Once you collect an Invitation, use its ability by summoning a party pallet or blocking a window, or use one of the other abilities to contribute to this challenge. You must add 3 contributions to complete the challenge on your end. <ul> <li data-index="4"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Show ’em What You Got</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 4 times across multiple Trials. Take your time with this one and activate the Invitation as and when you can in the role you’re playing. <ul> <li data-index="5"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bronze Age</strong>: Earn 6 emblems of bronze quality or better. You get these for playing to the strength of your role, so complete objectives like hooking Survivors and repairing generators, and you’ll earn them without any trouble. <ul> <li data-index="6"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Clean up After Yourself</strong>: Use the Invitation’s power to hook a Survivor remotely 2 times in multiple Trials.

This ability is hard to catch. When you’ve got an Invitation, you press the right joystick to activate it, and it’ll silence your Survivor for a short time. Do this twice to blast through this challenge. <ul> <li data-index="8"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Death of the Party</strong>: As a community, experience 5 million effects from the Bag of Tryks. This is incredibly easy, and you only need to contribute 5 experiences. The Bag of Tryks will activate and apply an effect for every two objectives completed, so just play, and you’ll get this done very quickly. <ul> <li data-index="9"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bloody Rewards</strong>: Earn 50,000 Bloodpoints. <ul> <li data-index="10"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Death of the Party</strong>: Experience 5 effects from the Bag of Tryks.

Encore!</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 times in a single Trial. This is a tricky challenge. Pick up the Invitation when you see it and activate its abilities every chance you get. The Invitation recharges over time, so hold onto it, and you’ll be able to use it three times in a single Trial, provided you don’t let things end too early. <ul> <li data-index="12"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

You’ll need to contribute at least 2 medals to the challenge, so pick a role you want to do it with and play until you’re done. <ul> <li data-index="5"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Light of the Party</strong>: Finish repairing 3 Anniversary generators as a survivor in Twisted Masquerade Trials. <ul> <li data-index="6"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Putting up the Decorations</strong>: Hook 6 Survivors on Anniversary hooks in Twisted Masquerade Trials as a Killer. <ul> <li data-index="7"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Encore! Encore!</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 times in a single Twisted Masquerade Trial. This is a tough one to pull off. It’s easier to do as a Survivor because more of you are working on spawning Invitations, which will give you more charges for its abilities. <ul> <li data-index="8"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Callousness or Compassion</strong>: As a community, earn a total of 200,000 Benevolent or Malicious emblems of gold quality or better as Survivors or Killers in Trials.

You’ve got to play to your role and spawn an Invitation first, then collect it, then you can use its ability. Note that you can complete this challenge across multiple Trials, so there is no need to sweat about doing it all in one. <ul> <li data-index="10"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Smash their Face In!</strong>: Activate the Invitation to spawn a party pallet 3 times. This can only be done as a Survivor, so hop into Trials in this role, collector Invitations, and get spawning those party pallets. <ul> <li data-index="11"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Suffer or Slaughter</strong>: As a community, earn a total of 150,000 Unbroken or Devout emblems of gold quality or better as a Survivor or Killer.

This is slightly more challenging to pull off. The Bag of Tryks applies status effects for every objective. If you complete two party events, such as repairing a generator or hooking a Survivor, you’ll trigger a new one. Otherwise, just play 5 Trials, and this challenge will be over. <ul> <li data-index="13"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2%E2%80%99s-new-season-comes-with-a-genius-triple-plot-twist.900867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177264/the-division-2-first-rogue-year-6-aaron-keener-plot-twists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UUFfqg">The Division franchise is best known for being a post-apocalyptic looter shooter, set in an alternate timeline where society collapsed due to a large-scale biological attack. Since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/23/8827287/the-division-hands-on-e3-xbox-one-ps4-preview"><em>The Division</em></a>’s launch in 2016, Ubisoft’s developers have been telling a long-running story around a mysterious rogue agent. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/22/18277513/the-division-2-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>The Division 2</em></a>’s most recent update includes a twist that is so implausible and goofy that it wraps all the way back around to being a work of genius.</p>
<p id="oN7RqY">In these games, the Strategic Homeland Division is a government agency that is embedded in society until times of great catastrophe, in which case its members are activated as super-cops aided by ISAC, a state-of-the-art AI. In the first game, the player meets with local Division leader Faye Lau, the two of them nearly get murdered, and then the player is authorized to start shooting and subsequently looting their way through New York City. </p>
<p id="ZBcwux">In between boss fights and collectible hunting, the player is introduced to the narrative thread that the Division is actually a bad idea for a crisis response team. A bunch of them have gone rogue, and the worst of them all is a real bad egg called Aaron Keener. Keener remains a background presence in the game’s lore for a while, only emerging to tell us about the recent bioterrorism he planned or all the good schemes he was enjoying.</p>
<p id="d2mEin">The mystery mounted over years. I played through <em>The Division 2</em>’s campaign looking out for any sign of him among my new Division colleagues. One character, Agent Kelso, really seemed like she was going to betray me. She even disappeared for a long time during a crucial mission and reemerged with suspicious timing. But none of my suspicions immediately paid off, and the Black Tusk paramilitary group became the primary threat.</p>
<p id="L196Ry">It wasn’t until the 2020 expansion <em>Warlords of New York</em> that players were finally able to confront Keener. The expansion was full of twists and turns, like Faye Lau murdering the president and framing the Division for the crime in a shocking double-cross. But players finally got to fight Keener as a boss, so that’s over with, right? </p>
<p id="Epq0Az">It’s <em>not </em>over with. You’ve fallen right into Aaron Keener’s trap, you gullible rube. He’s alive and kicking ass.</p>
<div id="oJ3ods"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z11NerWEkI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9xW2oY">Ubisoft helpfully explained the new status quo in a <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fgame%2Fthe-division%2Fthe-division-2%2Fnews-updates%2F9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY%2Fyear-6-season-1-first-rogue&amp;sharedid=polygon.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?subId2=[]pl[p]23941305[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026u=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY/year-6-season-1-first-rogue\u0026sharedid=polygon.com&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;subId2&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;subId2&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23941305[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY/year-6-season-1-first-rogue&quot;,&quot;sharedid&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">blog post</a>, which reads in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="sKuGmF">Year 5 Season 3 ended with a shocking revelation, Rogue agent number one and sworn nemesis of The Division, Aaron Keener is alive. In her hunt for truth, Agent Kelso located him and decided to join forces with him.</p>
<p id="9uZ88E">The line between light and dark, agent and rogue, keeps blurring as we learned that Keener was working with Faye Lau to undermine the Black Tusk and neutralize the Hunter threat during the events of Warlords of New York.</p>
<p id="QVebo5">Keener is coming to Washington, D.C. and he has sent us an invitation to parley, but first we will need to pass his twisted trials and prove our worth. An alliance with Keener and his Rogues could be the key to stopping Natalya Sokolova and the Black Tusk. But what will the cost be? </p>
<p id="nEZzhq">Can Keener be trusted? Is the enemy of our enemy truly our friend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="9xiqW4">As someone who had kept abreast of <em>The Division 2</em>’s developing story, my reaction to reading this missive and learning this information was “I’m sorry, what?” There’s a lot of double-crosses to sort through, especially since the line between light and dark keeps blurring!</p>
<p id="53Wgrh">I hear you asking: “Wait, if Keener’s a boss in the game who players murder, didn’t players see him die?” You fool. You absolute buffoon. Keener hacked ISAC so it just <em>looked</em> like he was dead. But he’s alive, and now he wants to tell you his <em>real</em> agenda, as long as you can survive his Joker traps...</p>
<p id="QlYpYk">Sir, I have been trying to find you and have a conversation for many years straight, so I’m starting to think you’re just a messy bitch who loves the drama. On the other hand, the audacity of this creative choice wins me over. Of <em>course</em> Keener is a super-genius who faked his own death by hacking your brain. Otherwise, he’d just be a guy in a hoodie recording brooding monologues for colleagues to find, and that’s not very fun.</p>
<p id="NGf8er"><em>The Division 2</em>’s next update includes other content and tweaks, as well as allowing players to access the endgame without purchasing <em>Warlords of New York</em>. Many fans seem surprised to see that <em>The Division 2</em> is still receiving updates, but Ubisoft has been supporting the game — as well as many of its other titles — with years of post-launch support. When that strategy leads to story beats this brilliant, I definitely support it. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177882/ps5-playstation5-discord-integration-how-to<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="BtggDd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ps5/21720698/best-ps5-games-playstation-5">PlayStation 5-havers rejoice</a> — Sony PlayStation announced Thursday that the PS5 will be getting Discord integration. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/">According to the PlayStation blog</a>, the new feature will roll out to users in the “coming weeks.” At long last, you’ll be able to play <em>Fortnite </em>and other multiplatform games with your dear PS5 friends without fudging around within different in-game chats. </p>
<p id="tDmiXe">Sony PlayStation, which owns a minority stake in Discord, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23582646/ps5-beta-system-update-discord-voice-chat-1440p-vrr">promised integration</a> with the chatting service <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22417630/playstation-discord-app-integration-release-dates-sony-investment">as far back as 2021</a>. It’s not that there <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22911255/discord-playstation-integration-how-to-link">was no way to use Discord as a PlayStation 5 user</a>, but prior use required other external apps and workarounds to use it. Now PlayStation users will be able to log on to chats directly from the console, “without relying on the Discord PC or mobile apps,” the blog said. The feature will launch over the next few weeks, “starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas.”</p>
<h2 id="a4ARC2"><strong>How to use Discord voice chat on the PS5</strong></h2>
<p id="JrakCq">Before you begin, make sure you have your console updated to the latest system software update and that your PlayStation Network and Discord are linked. (If you need instructions for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">how to update your console</a> or link your account, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/link-psn-status-discord/">you can find more details here</a>.)  However once you ahve that set up, it’s pretty easy to join. All you need to do is select the Discord tab in the Game Base in the PS5 Control Center and then chose the Discord server or DM group you want to join. After that, pick your voice channel, and that’s it. And if someone calls you, you’ll get a PS5 notification right away. </p>

The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange. Max has moved far away from Arcadia Bay for a fresh start and now works as an artist-in-residence at&nbsp;Caledon University in upstate Vermont. She has sworn to never use her time-rewind ability again, and hasn't since the first game's conclusion. Despite this, Max’s power has evolved. She can now travel between two timelines, an ability called Shift. Unfortunately, she only discovers this power after stumbling upon the sudden murder of her new friend, Safi.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Deck Nine, who developed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange_before_the_storm/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/07/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-complete-review.aspx">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/life-is-strange-true-colors/life-is-strange-true-colors-review-more-powerful-in-life-lessons">True Colors</a>, describes the game as a supernatural murder mystery. Max will travel across two realities: her present one and an alternate timeline where Safi is still alive but very much in danger. In the reality where Safi is killed, Max must find the culprit. In the timeline where Safi lives, she must prevent her murder. Solving and preventing the same crime involves searching for clues across both timelines and interacting with two versions of every character, whose behavior and relationship to Max changes based on the timelines, circumstances, and your choices. Like True Colors, Double Exposure is a single release divided into episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the million-dollar question for fans is how Double Exposure addresses Life Is Strange’s two endings. Deck Nine states the game includes a conversation between Max and Safi about Arcadia Bay, which will allow players to pick the ending they chose. This essentially determines Double Exposure’s canon, and your choice of ending will be reflected in Max’s thoughts, journals, text messages, and conversations with characters going forward. An example we see is a conversation where Safi asks Max who “the blue-haired girl” is to her, presenting a choice to establish Chloe’s relationship to Max.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In terms of gameplay, Max has lost her original time-rewind power. Instead, she can instantaneously swap timelines in certain spots to explore two versions of the same space. She’ll use this power to solve puzzles and circumnavigate inaccessible spaces (for example, a locked door in one timeline may be unlocked—or Max learns how to unlock it—in the other one). She can also use a “pulse” ability to extend her supernatural senses to determine weak points between the timelines, allowing her to see and hear ghostly glimpses of people and objects in the alternate reality without Shifting to it. Using this, she can eavesdrop on characters in the other timeline for intel and stealthily track suspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, beyond the murder mystery, Max will have to deal with the social drama of working on a college campus. As its artist-in-residence, she serves as a mentor figure to younger students, which she may or may not use to her advantage. An extended gameplay video shows Max hanging out with Safi and her best friend Moses to watch a meteor shower. In addition to showing off some of the choices that can steer this scene in different directions, we also see Max’s camera come into play, where she can capture photos of her friends. We also see the events leading up to Safi's murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure looks promising, and as a fan of the original, I'm looking forward to hanging with Max again and solving a new mystery. It launches on October 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<div>
  <p id="32Eto1">Although fans of <em>The Boys </em>will often refer to Butcher (Karl Urban) as the main character, it was Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) who served as the early seasons’ real co-protagonists. They were the ones who changed the most, who had their worldviews shattered in the pilot episode and had to rebuild themselves from scratch. Butcher’s stayed the same cranky, morally dubious bastard, but Hughie and Annie are unrecognizable from where they began.</p>
<p id="Takniu">And though Hughie had more screen time between the two, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/9/17/20870279/the-boys-comics-history-amazon-starlight">season 1 Annie</a> was the more compelling main character. Whereas Hughie had the comfort of at least being surrounded by people who shared his hatred of supes like A-Train, Annie was thrown right into the viper’s nest. She was forced to smile and make things work on a team filled with rapists and murderers, in a position where escape wasn’t a real option and coming forward publicly seemed pointless. Annie’s gradual self-actualization was more complicated than Hughie’s, but that only made it more interesting. Annie is always being pulled between multiple evolving teams with conflicting, dubious motives, but in season 1 the show was pulling off this delicate balancing act. Now, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173211/rewatch-the-boys-season-3-4-what-know-gen-v">season 4</a>, almost all sense of consistency or direction with Annie has fallen apart. </p>
<p id="X01vmX">Annie was well loved in season 1 among the <em>Boys</em> fandom, breaking the usual sexist internet trend that the most prominent female character in a franchise is the most loudly hated. As early as season 2, however, the fan sentiment started to sour, largely thanks to one giant misstep in “Nothing Like It in the World.” That’s the mid-season 2 episode where Annie kills an innocent civilian, a guy who was defending himself from what he assumed were violent carjackers. (An assumption that was basically correct.)</p>
<div id="du1kr0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8eJiUQRnJw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RBZeEl">The story uses this as part of a bonding subplot between Annie and Butcher, two characters who’d struggled to trust each other up to this point. “You know what I was thinking when I was looking at him?” she tells Butcher afterward. “<em>Why’d you pull a gun, you stupid fuck?</em> That’s all. Maybe once I would’ve cried over him, but... now he was just another person in our way.” This hardened, cynical way of thinking is presented as the turning point in her and Butcher’s relationship, the moment when they’ve fully got each other’s backs. </p>
<p id="23Idj4">The monologue is often unfairly interpreted by fans as Annie bragging, or mocking the guy for defending himself. But even among fans who understand this as Annie expressing regret and self-hatred, kicking herself for how callous she’s become, it still doesn’t work. Her murder of that civilian was way more uncalled for than the episode seemed to realize, something that should’ve lingered on Annie’s mind far longer than it does. The show really didn’t seem to understand the parallels to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/16/21440032/the-boys-stormfront-american-nazis-white-supremacy-fascism-themes-politics-supervillains-comics">the villain Stormfront</a>’s murder of an innocent driver earlier in the season; it drew that connection between the two characters, seemingly by accident, and then did nothing with it. </p>
<p id="ZQcnxg">This incident has always stuck in the minds of fans who’ve grown irritated with Annie’s role as the virtuous voice of reason, an approach that stirred up even more controversy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23150171/the-boys-season-3-review-amazon">in season 3</a>. First there was the messy season-long conflict between Annie and Hughie over whether or not Hughie should be using the Temp V. It was an interesting argument between the two; Annie was reasonably concerned about Hughie’s attitude shift and the potential consequences of the drug, while also not quite empathizing enough with just how scary life is for Hughie as a non-supe in this violent world. The problem is that it’s a storyline that doesn’t give Annie an arc. Hughie’s the one who changes, who learns a lesson and grows from it in the end, whereas Annie is presented as correct from start to finish. The end of the season shuts down any moral complexity on the topic when it reveals that Temp V will 100% give Hughie terminal cancer if he takes it again. After that, anything interesting the storyline might’ve told us about Annie’s value system is tossed to the side.</p>
<p id="AUTGrj">Season 3 in general felt uninterested in diving into the hows and whys of Annie’s choices. Beyond Hughie, her decision to focus on taking down Soldier Boy, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200207/the-boys-finale-homelander-black-adam-superman">not Homelander</a>, also lacked a clear, sympathetic explanation. Annie had three seasons’ worth of personal reasons to want Homelander dead, not to mention the ever-increasing likelihood that he’d snap completely and burn down the whole world. When she instead turned all her focus on opposing the one guy who could take Homelander down, the show’s explanation for it didn’t feel organic. Rather, it felt motivated by the show’s need to keep Homelander alive as long as possible, not by any natural continuation of her character growth from the first two seasons.</p>

<p id="bjr4Gb">There’s a similar sense of aimlessness with Annie throughout the first three episodes of season 4, with her already backtracking on her season 3 decision to give up the Starlight persona once and for all. Her feud with Homelander, which seemed to be her main priority for the first episode, at least, has also given way to refocusing on a new secondary villain. This time it’s Firecracker (Valorie Curry), a new member of The Seven who reveals that her main motivation is to get back at Annie for a mean, slut-shaming prank she did to her in their early teenage years. “Everybody thinks you’re so decent,” Firecracker tells Annie. “Know what I see? A conniving little mean-girl bitch in there. And when I’m done, the rest of the world is going to see it too.” </p>
<p id="aTfGMP">It’s a weird revelation, almost like the writers are engaging with the section of the fandom that resents Annie’s angelic-voice-of-reason status, essentially throwing the haters a bone in response to their increasingly loud complaints about the character. Although the show will almost certainly side with Annie in this feud — basing your whole adult life around a mean-girl incident when you were 13 is deeply unhealthy on Firecracker’s part, and the show is aware of this — the whole dynamic feels oddly trivial. Annie spent the first two and a half seasons having to hold her own against Homelander, and now she’s been thrown into a mean-girl feud with the least powerful new member of The Seven. If you were hoping season 4 would give Annie a sense of direction again, this is not a good sign.</p>
<p id="4RP0yP">It helps that Annie is so clearly better than her comic counterpart, an empty two-dimensional love interest that writer Garth Ennis barely seemed to care about. It’s hard to get too mad at the show’s depiction of Annie when we already know just how sloppily the character could’ve been portrayed. And season 4 is taking steps to deepen her relationship with her powers, establishing that Annie’s legitimately getting stronger, so hopefully during the next big fight scene she won’t be such an afterthought (the way it was with Soldier Boy in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/vwm066/starlight_vs_soldier_boy_expectation_vs_reality/">a widely mocked moment</a> in the season 3 finale). </p>
<p id="4CiVcC">But it’s also hard not to be frustrated when we know how well she could be written. Annie’s arc across the past two seasons so far has seemed scattershot, and unappreciative of just how fun Annie is when she’s actively shaping the plot with her decisions, rather than just the plot shaping her. Season 1 Annie was a vital character, someone whose scenes were filled with constant tension and intrigue. It’s hard to picture how <em>The Boys</em> will return to this, but here’s hoping they give Annie something meaningful to do again sometime soon. </p>
<p id="M2Mx8Z"><small>The first three episodes of </small><small><em>The Boys</em></small><small> season 4 are now streaming on Prime Video. New episodes are released every Thursday.</small></p>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a few interesting guns to be claimed from the Pale Heart of the Traveler in Destiny 2's new expansion, The Final Shape, but The Call is the standout. This little sidearm fires rockets--it's only the second rocket-assisted sidearm to come to Destiny 2, with the first being Indebted Kindness, a gun you could only get from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon. The Calling is easier to get and comes with a mess of good perks, but most importantly, it hits like a truck; once you get a good one of these, it's likely to stay in your loadout for a good, long time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call sports a lot of options for perks, and quite a few of the combinations are pretty good. There are at least a couple versions of this gun you might want to chase depending on your loadout. What's more, it's also craftable, so you can slap enhanced versions of your favorite perks on the gun for even more devastation. Honestly, there might be a couple "god rolls" for The Call. Here's how you can nab The Call and the perks you're going to want to chase for it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</h2><p dir="ltr">The Call will likely come into your inventory naturally through the course of The Final Shape's story campaign. It's one of the weapons that comes from Pale Heart engrams, which you'll get for completing Pale Heart activities and for ranking up your reputation with Ghost as you work through the new destination. There are also some activities, like Alone in the Dark missions in the Pale Heart, that will specifically dish out Deepsight Resonance (red border) versions of Pale Heart guns, so you can unlock the crafting pattern for the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">So generally, focusing your Pale Heart engrams is the best way to reliably pull new versions of The Call. You can unlock focusing once you've gathered five different Pale Heart weapons, which you can do pretty easily by completing the campaign and doing some Alone in the Dark quest steps. As you rank up with Ghost, you'll also unlock a perk that makes your first focused weapon of the week a guaranteed Deepsight Resonance version, helping you get to the crafted version of The Call faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813"></a><figcaption>The Call</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</h2><p dir="ltr">While The Call isn't much of a PvP weapon because of its slow firing rate and slow projectile speed, it's an absolute monster in PvE activities. It has excellent stopping power, often one- or two-shotting enemies even in raids and at higher difficulties. It also sports a range of perks that offer a ton of build synergy and boost its damage to make it more effective. One of the specific, interesting perks it carries is Beacon Rounds, which gives the gun tracking as you log kills with it and increases that tracking's effectiveness with more final blows. Tracking is actually really handy on this thing, because it allows you to fire into crowds or in the direction of distant enemies without really having to think or aim. Firing The Call from the hip to indiscriminately annihilate whatever's vaguely in front of you can be extremely handy.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch / Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li><li dir="ltr">Volatile Launch: +15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+3 Magazine size, +5 Stability, +10 Reload speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Demolitionist / Subsistence  <ul><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist: Kills from this weapon generate grenade energy. Activating your grenade ability reloads this weapon from reserves.</li><li dir="ltr">Subsistence: Defeating targets partially reloads this weapon from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Desperate Measures / One For All  <ul><li dir="ltr">Desperate Measures: Weapon final blows grant bonus damage. Melee and grenade final blows grant a large damage bonus that can stack.</li><li dir="ltr">One For All: Hitting three separate targets increases damage for a moderate duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Blast Radius</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's tough to go wrong with just about any roll of The Call, but there are quite a few great options that, when paired together with the right build, push it over the edge. The first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to prioritize direct hits over potential splash damage. The Call does fire rockets, but at base, their explosions aren't very big; you can spec the gun to have a larger Blast Radius to mess up more enemies in groups, and that can be great if you go for perks like One For All. But if you expect to use it more like a long-range shotgun, Velocity is probably more useful to make sure the projectiles get to their targets before those targets have a chance to move out of the way. After that, go for putting as many rounds in the magazine as you can with Tactical Mag.</p><p dir="ltr">Perks will depend on how you want to use The Call, but if you've got no other more specific plans, go with either Demolitionist or Subsistence. Demolitionist will give you synergy on restoring your grenade as quickly as possible, because you're very likely to use The Call to put down lots of enemies in quick succession because it's so damn useful. If you don't need the grenade energy or would rather increase your uptime with The Call without reloading it, Subsistence keeps giving you rockets back for each kill--and because so many kills will be one or two shots, you'll just keep firing.</p><p dir="ltr">One other good alternative in this column: Lead from Gold. An issue you might have with The Call is that it's <em>too</em> effective, running you out of Special ammo in a hurry. Lead from Gold can help keep your reserves up if you find you're scrounging a lot of the time. Oh, and finally, Beacon Rounds is probably not a go-to, but can make for a fun version of this gun, with the tracking making it so you barely have to think about what you're shooting at and helping you take out pesky enemies at long ranges.</p><p dir="ltr">The second Perk column is full of damage-boosting options and they're basically all good, so you can pick here based on what's best for your build. Desperate Measures and One For All are the main choices because they're both easy to activate, specifically with the way you'll be using The Call. One For All gives a slightly better damage boost if you can kill three enemies within three or so seconds of one another, which is the primary use case for this gun, but Desperate Measures stacks with your melee and grenade ability and lasts longer. If you're running something like a Prismatic Hunter build with Combination Blow and Liar's Handshake, Desperate Measures is excellent, getting a big damage boost every time you start punching your way through enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows grant this weapon tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Vorpal Weapon  <ul><li dir="ltr">Increased damage against bosses, vehicles, and Guardians with their Super active.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Where The Call has lots of perks that give good synergy in PvE, where you're racking up kills against smaller at a constant clip, most of its perks offer very little in PvP, where kills can be harder to come by. Here, you want to focus on Velocity over Blast Radius because the utility of The Call will be in dealing big direct-hit damage to opposing players, and you want those projectiles to get to their targets as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There aren't many great perk options here that you're getting to get a lot of use out of. Beacon Rounds is probably your best bet, adding tracking to your rockets after you notch a kill, which will help you earn a second kill if you're in a fight with more than one Guardian and can live that long. The second column has very little in the way of reliable PvP damage boosters, though. Vorpal Weapon is a decent pick specifically because you don't have to do anything in particular to activate it. If you're scoring a lot of kills, you can opt for one of the other boosters like Desperate Measures, but most don't become effective until <em>after</em> you've already won the fight you're in, making them all pretty equal in being unappealing.</p><p dir="ltr">We've got lots more coverage from Destiny 2's new expansion, so check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was almost a year ago that we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-is-being-ported-to-modern-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> of modern console port plans for <em>Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3</em>. Now ININ has come through with a date, opening the umbrella for a smooth glide to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox consoles on July 11, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">With that lovely news comes an appropriately bubbly release date trailer, showing some footage of the port and promising “many quality-of-life enhancements.” Please, enjoy another pre-release peek at Bub and Bob in their stout little human forms and prep for the arrival of the <em>Rainbow Islands </em>sequel below.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III Release Date Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sdflq9NwxCg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">As for what those enhancements are, the updated port has added in the usual retro bells and whistles, namely the inclusion of save states and the ability to rewind gameplay. There are also shaders and filters that aim to recreate the experience of playing on a CRT screen. Beyond that, the hook here is very much the ability to play and own a relatively obscure entry in Taito’s storied series.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">There’s no mention of including the other versions — which spanned Atari ST, Amiga, Game Boy, and NES — so it looks like we’re just getting the PC Engine/Turbografx-16 version of <em>Parasol Stars</em>. That’s fine and dandy, especially considering the fact that it’s priced at a cool $9.99. Nintendo Switch pre-orders are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live now</a> and 10 percent off until July 12, with Xbox pre-orders to follow on June 19. The game can also be <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted</a> on PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of the rarest skins in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> is making its return and all of its sales are going to charity. The Pink Mercy skin has returned to Overwatch 2 for the first time since 2018, along with a new Rose Gold variant and the money from its sales are being donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF.)</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104271/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, the Pink Mercy skin will be available for purchase from June 25 to July 8, costing $15, the same price it was back in 2018. All of the money, excluding taxes and platform fees, will be donated to the BCRF. During that same period a second charity bundle will be available, the Rose Gold Mercy Bundle. This bundle costs $20 and features the Rose Gold Mercy skin and weapon skin, along with three player icons, sprays, and banners. All proceeds from that bundle will also be donated to charity. It's important to note that since the proceeds are going to charity, these bundles can't be bought with Overwatch Coins and must be bought as a direct purchase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825"></a><figcaption>The new Rose Gold Mercy skin will also be available, with all of the proceeds going to charity as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Pink Mercy skin quickly became one of the rarest and most sought-after skins in Overwatch, thanks to its limited availability. It was only on sale for a short period of time and at the time it was one of the few skins that was being sold for direct purchase instead of being included in loot boxes. It also hasn't been available since 2018, so anyone who started playing Overwatch since that time hasn't even had a chance to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Blizzard, the last time the Pink Mercy skin was sold it raised $12.7 million for the BRCF and it still holds the record for the largest single donation. Overwatch 2 Season 11, Super Mega Ultrawatch, launches on June 20, just a few days before the Pink Mercy skin returns to the store.</p>

<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amidst the flurry of Steam Next Fest demos, <em>Codename: Ocean Keepe</em>r from RetroStyle Games emerges as a standout, blending underwater mecha action with the survival challenges of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Quite the exciting twist, and one that brings with it an interesting new take on the action survival roguelike genre.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">At first glance, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>entices with its premise, merging the allure of ancient horrors with the futuristic focus of underwater mech combat. Players assume the role of a pilot tasked with navigating treacherous undersea environments teeming with monstrous creatures. Drawing from the survival roguelike elements of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the game challenges players to scavenge for resources, upgrade their mech, and battle increasingly formidable adversaries.</p>
 <h2 id="h-gameplay-undersea" data-injectable="false">Gameplay Undersea</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">The gameplay loop of <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> revolves around strategic decision-making based on an ever-looming timer. Each dive into the abyss presents new dangers and opportunities, from important resource gathering to artifact scavenging, testing both reflexes and tactical prowess. Your mech can be customizable with an array of weapons and utilities and becomes the player’s lifeline against the tide of increasingly monstrous denizens.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Resource and artifact harvesting are critical aspects of the gameplay loop in <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>. To survive the waves of alien lifeforms that arrive at specific time intervals, players must constantly gather resources and artifacts to purchase upgrades within a session. These upgrades are essential, not only for sustaining themselves but also, for upgrading their mechs and enhancing their chances against the relentless onslaught from the depths. As the countdown to these encounters ticks away, strategic resource management becomes paramount, adding a layer of constant urgency that eats away at you as you progress.</p>
 <h2 id="h-demo-dives-unveiling-the-adventure" data-injectable="false">Demo Dives: Unveiling the Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">From the moment I jumped into <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>’s demo, I was immersed in a world where action and strategy merge seamlessly. The game wastes no time throwing you into the thick of it as soon as you start the game for the first time. This immediate engagement hooks instantly, as you’re encouraged by the game’s short tutorial to explore the abyssal depths for vital resources. After this tutorial, the ticking timer begins, and the frantic race for upgrade resources begins.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Navigating the murky depths in search of resources felt exhilarating yet perilous. Yes, you’re in an undersea spider mech, but that alone is far from enough to survive the horrors that lurk in the dark. Every moment-to-moment decision counts as resources carry weight, forcing you to carefully balance the amount you gather against the time needed to return them to your mech. This dynamic adds a layer of tension and strategic depth that kept me constantly on my toes, calculating risks and rewards with each venture into the unknown.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">The timer looming in the background heightens the sense of urgency, reminding you that every second counts. It’s a thrilling balancing act that demands both quick thinking and precise execution, ensuring that each gameplay session is a gripping challenge. The monsters of the depths grow stronger with each passing moment, and you’re tasked with keeping up with the tide or risk becoming derelict at the bottom of the sea.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>shines with its gameplay mechanics, however, I did find myself occasionally distracted by the repetitive nature of its music and audio design. The soundtrack initially sets a mood of suspense and anticipation, which I enjoyed, but the repetitive loops became somewhat annoying after only a few minutes. Particularly, the singular track that played during combat encounters became especially tiresome. Nevertheless, exploring the depths and overcoming challenges in this captivating underwater world was still an enjoyable experience for me, and I have no doubts RetroStyle Games will make the necessary changes for the game’s full release.</p>
 <h2 id="h-looking-forward" data-injectable="false">Looking Forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> beckons players into its intriguing universe. A recent <a href="https://youtu.be/21JOxYMcH_8">trailer</a> teases a game filled with danger and peril, offering an adventure that’s both captivating and challenging for indie gaming enthusiasts. Setting itself apart from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> introduces a distinctive twist that seamlessly blends undersea adventure with strategic resource gathering, a blend that highlights the promising bright future ahead for this title.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="false">If you’re interested in trying out <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>, you can jump in right now with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2845630/Codename_Ocean_Keeper/">free demo available on Steam.</a> It’s a great way to explore the game’s universe and experience its challenging strategic gameplay firsthand. Whether you’re drawn in by its unique premise or just looking for something new in indie gaming, the demo offers a taste of what promises to be an exciting change of pace for the genre.</p>

            <p>The latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> patch is memorably titled 01.000.400, but for my money, it's hovering on the  brink of being one of your gold-varnished "X.0" updates of note. It adds a fair few mechanics and makes various substantial adjustments to Arrowhead and Sony's liberty-humping, cheerily xenocidal squad shooter. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>These include making supply lines and attack origins visible on the Galactic War map, so you can (in theory) cut off invasions at their root, together with an absolute slew of stratagem and weapon balancing changes, an accompanying tsunami of tweaks for Automaton and Terminid enemies, and a positive landslide of, errrrm, reworks for planetary maps. Also, invite-only lobbies! Though they're currently only localised in English.</p>
<p>It's late here, I still have jetlag from SGF and Geoff Keighley or one of his agents seems to have given me some kind of plague, thankfully not Covid, so permit me to dive in and pull out a few things from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english">the full patch notes</a>, rather than committing to a comprehensive digest. One thing that catches my eye is that they've adjusted enemy spawning so that you'll get fewer heavily armoured enemies, such as Bile Titans or Hulks, and more smaller, squishier enemies, with a view to making your tactics less monotonous. "Our intent is to ease up on the demand of anti-tank weapons and by having more of the other enemies give a better incentive for the group to bring stratagems and weapons that take care of hordes," the developers explain. </p>
<p>This desire for variety also informs their tweaks to the game's Stratagems. "With these balance changes we wanted to buff up some of the weaker stratagems to make them more viable and add more possibility for variety in the loadouts," the post goes on. "We also changed a few to make them more consistent, but the goal was to keep a similar or higher power level."</p>
<p>As regards the above Galactic War stuff, Arrowhead note that "supply lines were previously not shown on the Galactic War map to reduce clutter and improve readability". The developers are, nonetheless, keen to expose the game's table-toppy metagame workings to players and encourage us all to strategise properly rather than dogpiling whichever world starts trending on Twitter. "You will now also be able to see which planet an attack is originating from, potentially allowing for the community to stop the attack at its source," the Steam post suggests.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the cavalry is finally coming for stealthy solo Helldivers such as myself, as the game's plants will now actually screen people from view. "Vegetation that's large enough to slow the player now has an extra function," the post reads. "When inside the vegetation helldivers will be harder to detect, reducing their detection range by enemies. This effect stacks with other detection reducing effects such as nighttime, being crouched or prone, or things such as the scout armor passive." </p>
<p>A meaty update, by all that's Super-Democratic! I'm sure the internet's Pandemonium-Dippers will find much to chew over and complain about, for the cycle of feedback and updates must continue to spin, though hopefully it'll be nothing as severe as what happened when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">Sony insisted everybody get a PSN account and effectively banned whole countries from the game</a>. The only thing it's missing, really, is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-order-turns-planet-into-black-hole-as-rumours-of-returning-illuminate-faction-intensify">a new enemy faction</a> of some kind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="1GJMvA">James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo — the members who make up the world-famous band Metallica — are taking to the virtual stage. Starting Thursday, the band is headlining <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998496/fortnite-festival-the-weeknd-meme">Fortnite Festival</a>. Its arrival brings Metallica tracks that fans can play, specially-themed cosmetic items, and most notably, a new PvP mode in case you want to put your rhythm game chops to the test and compete against others. </p>
<p id="zTP6CO">Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game available within <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>, has featured pop stars like The Weeknd and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24078316/fortnite-lady-gaga-festival-dlc">Lady Gaga</a> in the past. Now, the theme will get a bit more metal. Epic Games announced six tracks that collect some of Metallica’s popular hits. They are as follows: “Enter Sandman,” “Fuel,” “Master of Puppets,” “Ride the Lightning,” “The Unforgiven,” and “Wherever I May Roam.” </p>
<p id="sNU1f4">As usual, the new season will introduce a separate battle pass for Fortnite Festival where players can unlock a variety of cosmetic items for both the free and Premium Reward Track. The Premium track unlocks the Lars Ulrich Outfit right away, but you’ll have to progress through the battle pass to unlock the other three band members. And if you really want to get into it, alternate “Puppet Master” versions of each bandmate will be purchasable in the Fortnite Shop for the duration of Season 4. You can view the full list of cosmetics available on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-festival-season-4-prepare-for-battle-with-metallica">Fortnite blog</a>. </p>
<p id="4wUBP7">Chapter 5 Season 4 in <em>Fortnite </em>starts June 13 and ends Aug. 16. </p>

The studio held a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5oyn4xIYRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal lifestream</a></span> today, June 13, and on top of interviews with the development team and Max voice actor Hannah Telle, the stream concluded with 18 minutes of gameplay footage. The stream was enlightening, both in that it answered questions fans have had since the reveal trailer premiered, and in reassuring anyone worried that Max might be less of an absolute dork this time around.<br></p><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196307,196470" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of the key points brought up during the stream is that <em>Double Exposure</em> will respect both of the original game’s divergent endings. Spoilers for a nearly decade-old game, but <em>Life is Strange </em>ended with Max choosing to either save her friend/possible girlfriend Chloe or the town of Arcadia Bay. Those are two very different outcomes, but it looks like Deck Nine isn’t making a choice about which one is canon in <em>Double Exposure</em>.</p><p>At some point in the game, players will talk to Max’s friend Safi about her past, and that will include defining their relationship with Chloe and whether or not they chose to save her. It’s unclear how, if at all, this will affect <em>Double Exposure</em>’s story, but at the very least everyone will get to see how Max’s life played out in either scenario. <em>Double Exposure </em>finds Max incollege, where her life seems pretty distanced from her time back in Arcadia Bay, so if <em>Double Exposure</em> can acknowledge the player’s decision without engaging with it too much, that’s probably easier on the team.</p><p>Beyond that, we also got a pretty extensive look at what seems to be an early segment in the first episode. <em>Double Exposure </em>is a murder mystery that follows Max as she learns that she can jump between two timelines. She’ll move between them to search for clues, but it’s possible for the player to get confused and pick dialogue options that should only apply to one timeline or the other. For instance, one clip shown during the stream had Max apologizing for “being nosy” talking to someone in one timeline, seemingly for mentioning something she’d talked about in the other. That’s an interesting way of making sure you’re paying attention. We don’t see Max using her timeline-jumping abilities in the 18 minutes of footage that capped off the stream, but there are clips of it interspersed between the interviews.</p><p>The segment we do see has Max hanging out with her new friends Fari and Moses. Even as a <em>Life Is Strange </em>diehard, I felt a little awkward watching the scene unfold. Many players, myself included, found the dialogue in the original <em>Life Is Strange</em> often pretty stiff and silly, and I was kinda hoping that revisiting Max a few years later would have gotten us past that. Maybe the tone of things will shift when the murder mystery begins properly. Check out the footage below:</p><p><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em> launches on October 29 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch. The game has only been announced for under a week and it’s already got a little bit of controversy after it was revealed that people who pay extra for the game’s Ultimate Edition <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ultimate-edition-early-1851529762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-ultimate-edition-early-1851529762">can play two episodes weeks in advance</a></span>, leaving people who can’t afford it open to spoilers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s being developed by Strange Scaffold, the same developers behind last year’s amazing <em>Max Payne</em>-like shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>. </em>And like that fantastic game, <em>Beast</em> is an indie shooter that feels incredible to play and lets you step into the boots of a true alpha predator.<br></p><p>In <em>Beast</em>, you start every level with no guns or weapons. Instead, you have to find them, either by killing enemies or scavenging them from the level. Knives, pistols, shotguns, and even tree branches are all fair game and can be quite deadly if used correctly. There’s also no reloading, forcing you to hunt down enemies for more weapons. Of course, you can also forgo weapons and just use your bare hands and feet to punch and stomp enemies to death. All attacks in <em>I Am Your Beast </em>are snappy and responsive. I always felt in control during combat, even when things got hectic or I fucked up and missed my last shot or tossed a knife the wrong way.<br></p><p>With a bit of practice, you’ll quickly become (and feel like) a deadly, unstoppable predator. And that’s when<em> I Am You Beast</em> goes from good to amazing. That’s because, once you nail the controls and learn how combat flows, you can then focus on completing each level as quickly and smoothly as possible to receive a perfect rating.<br></p><p>This is where <em>I Am Your Beast </em>sunk its claws into me. I spent over two hours just replaying the four main levels in the demo, trying to get faster and faster times. When you die or reset, the game loads almost instantly, making it easy to repeat a level over and over and over until you get that perfect run. And once you nail that incredible run you’ll be hungry to shave off another second. Maybe next time don’t jump up to the branch, but instead slide into the guard and get his rifle first. Try blowing up the barrels after you kill the guard on the center hill. These kinds of thoughts—hunting for every possible opportunity to optimize your time—will flood your brain as you play levels in <em>I Am Your Beast </em>again and again.</p><p>The few levels in<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>I Am Your Beast</em>’s demo</a></span> were more than enough to keep me busy for a night. I can’t imagine how much time I’ll be able to sink into the full game when it arrives on PC on August 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within Cinematic Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Sulfuras is an iconic weapon. It's the first Legendary item players were able to obtain in the original version of WoW, a massive two-handed mace wielded by the Ragnaros the Firehold himself that can hurl fireballs at opponents. It also requires a significant amount of time and gold in order to craft. While the weapon was good originally, there were still better options out there for some classes, despite Sulfuras being a Legendary.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard clearly wants to make Sulfuras even more fitting of its Legendary status in phase four of Season of Discovery. According to the datamine, Sulfuras will feature a slightly slower swing speed, resulting in higher top-end damage. Its chance-on-hit fireball effect has been tweaked to not only deal damage but also sunder a target's armor. The weapon will feature a 20% chance to deal 25 fire damage to all nearby enemies when struck by a melee attack (a change from a guaranteed 5 fire damage dealt to melee attackers), giving the weapon a little AOE splash damage when fighting a group of enemies. And last but not least, the weapon is getting a Druid specific attack power bonus, making the item especially appealing to Feral Druids.</p><p dir="ltr">Sulfuras is hardly the only change that has been datamined. It seems the game's first raid, Molten Core, will be receiving additional difficulty modifiers in the form of "Heat Levels." There are <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/ashbringer-placeholder-quest-item-datamined-on-season-of-discovery-phase-4-ptr-342918" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hints</a> that Blizzard may make one of the Warcraft universe's most iconic weapons, the Ashbringer, actually obtainable in WoW Classic, something that wasn't possible in the original game despite long standing rumors and fan theories stating otherwise. There's even indications that Blizzard may add yet another all-new Legendary weapon, the <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/broxigars-axe-model-datamined-in-season-of-discovery-phase-4-ptr-axe-of-cenarius-342902" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Axe of Cenarius</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not yet given a date for when phase four of Season of Discovery and all of its endgame changes will go live, but has said it will be discussing more details in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, WoW Classic Cataclysm is in full-swing, while players who enjoy the modern version of WoW can level-up in the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">Mists of Pandaria Remix event</a> ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">The War Within's launch on August 26</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/gigsky-esim-data-plan/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gigsky-esim-data-plan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="165" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Tired of spending hundreds of dollars on high roaming fees during your international trips? <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky</mark></a> is here to help with their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>low-cost International eSIM Data Plans</mark></a>.</p> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">With GigSky, you can pay a fraction of the cost for a cellular data plan, make a couple of small changes in your phone settings, and have <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>instant, high-quality cellular data</mark></a> the moment you land for your international trip.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Trusted by over 250,000 travelers around the world and with an above-average 4.6 rating out of nearly <a href="https://inkdesk.click/Buf-_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>800 customer reviews on Apple’s App Store</mark></a>, GigSky is the premier choice for all your international travel data needs.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-gigsky" data-injectable="false">What is GigSky?</h2> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">Founded in 2010 and headquartered in Silicon Valley, GigSky has been a champion of global mobility and an advocate of consumer choice for over a decade. They are the first <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>eSIM Based Mobile Network Operator</mark></a>, and their data-only network covers <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>200+ destinations</mark></a> and access to over 400 networks worldwide including maritime networks (cruise ships) and inflight.</p> <h2 id="h-how-is-gigsky-different-from-traditional-esim-resellers" data-injectable="false">How is GigSky different from traditional eSIM resellers?</h2> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">Almost every eSIM company on the market today is just a reseller of someone else’s services. They buy a handful of eSIM profiles from a local carrier and resell these to their customers. Unfortunately, this means that they are not able to offer any meaningful support to those who buy a plan.</p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky</mark></a>, on the other hand, is an <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>actual network operator</mark></a>. They partner with over 400 cellular providers across the globe and are able to provide their customers with top-flight data connectivity. If a certain network goes down, GigSky simply shifts its users to one that is not down. eSIM resellers are not able to do this. Heck, they wouldn’t even know the network they sold to the customer is down.</p>
 <p data-characters="557" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Being an operator provides one other major customer benefit – the ability to use one eSIM, no matter where you travel. For resellers, each plan you buy generates a new eSIM, requiring customers to download, activate, and change over to this new eSIM. That can be quite complex for many people. <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>With GigSky</mark></a>, once your eSIM is set up, it doesn’t matter where you travel. You’ll be able to continue to use a single eSIM. Even as you <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>travel back and forth between countries</mark></a>, GigSky will automatically shift your plan to the country you are in.</p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">In addition to providing <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>service in over 190 countries</mark></a>, GigSky users can use their product while at sea (on over 190 different cruise ships), offshore (throughout the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea), and inflight (on over 20 different airlines). No other eSIM competitor can boast the same combination of land/sea/air options.</p> <h2 id="h-trusted-by-companies-like-apple-and-visa" data-injectable="false">Trusted by companies like Apple and Visa</h2> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Did you know that <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky was a launch partner with Apple</mark></a> when the eSIM was first released in 2018? Apple selected GigSky to be one of its launch partners due to GigSky’s deep expertise in data connectivity and history of technical innovation.</p>
 <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">Also, <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>GigSky’s global partnership with Visa</mark></a>, whereby eligible Visa cardholders can redeem a complimentary data plan as a cardholder benefit highlights the quality of GigSky’s service and their ability to integrate their product with one of the leading financial services companies in the world. Visa selected GigSky as their global partner due to their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>unsurpassed network quality</mark></a>, their <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>24/7/365 Live customer support</mark></a>, and the simplicity of the user experience.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-only-esim-company-with-a-free-plan" data-injectable="false">The only eSIM company with a free plan</h2> <p data-characters="671" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="false">GigSky recently released a unique offering on the market – <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>a free 100 MB plan</mark></a>. There are no strings attached and no credit card is required. Whether a customer is new to eSIM and wants to play around with the technology, or is new to GigSky and wants to test the quality of our service, <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>their FREE plan</mark></a> is a difference maker in the industry. Consider this Free plan to be GigSky’s way of helping grow global awareness of eSIM technology and getting everyone connected no matter where they travel. <a href="https://inkdesk.click/THgfW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>Check out the GigSky website</mark></a> or <a href="https://inkdesk.click/Buf-_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark>download their app on Apple’s App Store</mark></a> for more information on how you can save some money with your upcoming travel plans.</p>

		<p>While we’re in the thick of not-E3, it’s fair to say that the announcements are coming thick and fast. Amongst the minute by minute trailer drops, the fantastic-looking new hero shooter from Bad Guitar studio, FragPunk, immediately stood out to me amongst the other games appearing in the Xbox Showcase. Coming from publisher NetEase, this 5v5 competitive shooter has all the hallmarks of a multiplayer hit, especially if it plays as good as it looks.</p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk: Official World Premiere Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fN8EdlB0P10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First up, this is a console exclusive, coming to Xbox Series X|S as well as the mighty PC, so PlayStation fans will have to look over the wall at this one, at least for the moment. The trailer gives you a taste of the vibrant visual design, as well as a hefty dose of attitude that you’d expect from a game named FragPunk.</p>
<p>Set in a futuristic, hyper-stylised universe, players can use various cards to modify how they approach combat, unlocking special abilities and modifiers to keep things consistently fresh. Netease have also announced the first Closed Alpha Test on Steam, running from June 27 to July 1 for selected participants, focused this time on North America.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jackbox-megapicker-lets-you-pick-and-choose-your-games-on-pc-next-month.900738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jackbox-megapicker-july<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jackbox has announced&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker</em>, a new free Steam app that lets you pick and choose individual games from all of your&nbsp;<em>Jackbox&nbsp;</em>collections.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/jackbox-games-10-years-of-laughing-quipping-and-fibbing">began in 2014</a>, and nine further installments have been released since then, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance">tenth launching late last year</a>. If you own them all on Steam, it can be pretty tricky to remember which minigames belong to which collection.</p>
<p>Thankfully,&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>will soon make that problem a thing of the past, as long as you're using Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-party-pack-announcement-comments.jpg?itok=AiAcAHXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-jackbox-megapicker-party-pack-announcement-comments.jpg?itok=49JgSWnI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jackbox has had a fair few requests for a <em>Megapicker</em> app.</figcaption></figure><p>In a press release, Jackbox says that many users have asked for a&nbsp;<em>Megapicker</em>-style app over the years, and that with more than 50 games now available via the&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>titles, the time is ripe for such an app to debut.</p>
<p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Megapicker&nbsp;</em>will do exactly what you think it'll do. It'll scan your Steam library for&nbsp;<em>Jackbox Party Pack&nbsp;</em>games, then add them to a unified app from which you can launch whichever games you like.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to sort and filter the games you own, although Jackbox hasn't said exactly how you'll be able to do this or what the limitations of the system will be yet.</p>
<p>We do know that&nbsp;<em>The Jackbox Megapicker&nbsp;</em>is launching sometime in July, and that Jackbox will provide more information about exactly how it'll work in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-a-major-balancing-patch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Helldivers 2 patch 1.000.400 is live and introduces many balancing changes for weapons and stratagems. Johan Pilestedt, the now Chief Creative Officer at Arrowhead Game Studios, took the time to explain the new patch to the community and explain why they made certain decisions through a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/5998312279129319530?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Steam.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Pilestedt’s first focus was on addressing the community’s feedback and the aim of the new Helldivers 2 patch. The team’s goal was to enhance the usability of weaker stratagems by significantly boosting their capabilities. This includes changes to other stratagems to ensure a more consistent gameplay experience and to introduce a wider variety of play loadouts.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-balancing-changes">Helldivers 2 Balancing Changes</h2>



<p>The A/MLS-4X Rocket Sentry has been made more effective against medium to large enemy types, with improved ammo economy. This change enhances the stratagem’s performance and creates a clear distinction between it and the autocannon sentry. The A/MG-43 Machine Gun sentry’s cooldown has been reduced, allowing players to use it more frequently when transitioning between positions. Additionally, the durability of several sentries has been increased by 80%, providing players with more robust defensive options.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The E/MG-101 now has a 100% increase in rotation speed, making it more effective for defending a fixed position. The explosion damage for the MD-6 Anti-Personnel Minefield and MD-14 Incendiary Mines has been increased to enhance the effectiveness of these stratagems, with more improvements planned for the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have reduced the cooldown times for Orbital Gatling, Precision Strike, and Orbital Airburst Strike in the Orbital stratagems. For the Eagle stratagems, the 110mm Rocket Pods now have improved targeting, better projectile armour penetration, reduced projectile damage, and reduced explosion armour penetration. The Eagle Strafing Gun has also increased uses and improved armour penetration, enabling players to damage heavily armoured enemies.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The damage caused by the GL-21 Grenade Launcher has been increased to better handle large groups of enemies. The standard projectile damage and projectile damage against durable body parts for the MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun, MG-43 Machine Gun, A/MG-43 Machine Gun Sentry, A/G-16 Gatling Sentry, and EXO-45 Patriot Exosuits Gatling have been improved as well. Additionally, the reload time for the MG-206 Heavy Machine Gun and the MG-43 Machine Gun has been reduced, making these weapons faster and more effective.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Moreover, the Helldivers 2’s 1.000.400 update included various adjustments to several other stratagems too. Balancing is an ongoing process, and despite the numerous changes, the developers will need to revisit these stratagems soon. However, it’s great to see that players in the comments section of the Twitter post about this patch are pleased with the new buffs and are eager to test these changes in the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-gameplay-changes">Helldivers 2 Gameplay Changes</h2>



<p>In patch 1.000.400, there are many gameplay changes as well. The AA-Defenses modifier is no longer in the game, the Retrieve Essential Personnel has been disabled for now, and Super Samples will spawn on difficulty six after the new patch. Also, you can now say goodbye to randoms joining your lobbies, as Invite-Only lobbies will be supported in the latest update. Additionally, there are several more changes to the Galactic War and many bug fixes in Helldivers 2 patch 1.000.400. You can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4150709804553746157?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="263" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">2023 and 2024 have been banner years for fantasy anime thanks to two shows in particular: <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/frieren-is-a-gorgeous-melancholic-anime-set-after-the-rpg-adventure-ends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End</a> </em>and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/delicious-in-dungeon-netflix-first-episode-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></a>.

While we wait for more info on the followup, a new trailer and key visual made their way online along with the reveal.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via official Dungeon Meshi Twitter</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="796" data-injectable="true">Based on the manga of the same name by Ryoko Kui—known as <em>Dungeon Meshi </em>in Japan—<em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>really is the ideal adventure for fans of dungeon-crawling RPGs. The story follows Laios and his party, who end up losing all their money and provisions after a powerful dragon attacks them deep in a dungeon. They also lose a key party member in the process, so their primary objective is to return and save Laios’s sister Falin from the dragon’s maw before it’s too late.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">With the party now strapped for food and coin, though, they’re going to have to get creative if they want to survive long enough to find her. That’s where Laios’ brilliant plan to “eat the monsters” comes into play. <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> quickly becomes a dungeon foodie travelogue, as Laios enlists the assistance of Senshi, a veritable gourmand of the grotesque.&nbsp;Fans of bestiaries, I implore you to watch. </p>
 <h2 id="h-pipin-hot-provisions" data-injectable="false">Pipin’ hot provisions</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Kadokawa Anime Channel on YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><em>Delicious in Dungeon </em>works for a lot of reasons. It has a strong cast of characters, fantastic designs and animation from anime studio TRIGGER (<em>Kill la Kill</em>, <em>PROMARE</em>), and countless inventive ways to catch, prep, cook, and devour the denizens of the deep. It’s not all lighthearted fun and games, and the latest trailer above closes out with a foreboding tease of what’s to come. &nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="false">Yoshihiro Miyajima (episodes of <em>DARLING in the FRANXX</em>, <em>BNA: Brand New Animal</em>) directed the first season of <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, which is available to stream on Netflix. Kimiko Ueno (<em>Little Witch Academia</em>) handled writing duties, with Naoki Takeda (chief animation director for <em>BNA</em>) adapting Ryoko Kui’s original character designs for the screen. Whichever staff members return for the second season, let them cook.&nbsp;</p>

After its initial launch in 2017, the game is getting a major update, and Nintendo Switch launch with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bigmode-videogamedunkeys-indie-publisher-announces-their-debut-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VideogameDunkey’s publisher, Bigmode</a>. </p> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">The first game that Bigmode ever published was the phenomenal <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>. <em>Star of Providence</em> already has a big fan base on Steam, but the Nintendo Switch release, alongside a major update, will bring new players who have never experienced it before and could be a massive moment for developer Team D13. Bigmode picked a fantastic game to help bring to market with <em>Animal Well</em>, and I’m confident that when released, the Switch version and major update for this next game will feel just as good to play. </p>
 <h2 id="h-when-is-the-release-date-for-the-star-of-providence-major-update-and-nintendo-switch-version" data-injectable="false">When is the release date for the <em>Star of Providence</em> major update and Nintendo Switch version?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Star of Providence is Coming" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRvv1ezR_Rs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true"><em>Star of Providence</em>‘s major update and Nintendo Switch version will be released in <strong>February 2025</strong>. We don’t have an exact date yet, but the fact that it’s eight months away at the time of writing shows that, hopefully, enough time has been set aside for development so that, when they arrive, the major update and Nintendo Switch version will be highly polished. </p>
 <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">We don’t currently have any details on what the new content in the major update for <em>Star of Providence</em> will add. It’s worth keeping an eye on the <a href="https://bigmode.com/games/star-of-providence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Bigmode page</a> for the game to catch updates as they’re added, though I suspect we won’t hear much until closer to launch. </p> <h2 id="h-what-is-star-of-providence" data-injectable="false">What is <em>Star of Providence</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bigmode</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">As I mentioned above, <em>Star of Providence</em> is a top-down shooter with procedurally generated elements. You must explore a facility and fight your way through each level, beating up bosses and gaining upgrades as you go. </p> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">The game boasts over 120 unique enemies to shoot your way through, dozens of powerups and modifiers, and six playable ships to try out. Each ship has its own unique play style, so runs will be completely different if you swap your ship from the one you’re used to. </p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The layouts of levels are randomized in each run with some very lethal hand-crafted death traps to run into, and all the while, you’ll be battling against the intricate attack pattern of whatever combination of enemies the level has decided to throw your way. </p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="false">If you want to try <em>Star of Providence</em> out ahead of its major update and Nintendo Switch release, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Star_of_Providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>. In March 2024, a team finished putting together a level editor for the title, meaning there will likely be dozens of user-created levels to play through while you wait for February 2025.</p>

<p data-characters="173" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>EA FC 24</em> Konrad Laimer Path to Glory SBC is the last special challenge of this promo in Ultimate Team and features a unique version of the Bayern and Austria midfielder.</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Like all Path to Glory cards, this Laimer item will be eligible for a maximum of five upgrades. While Austria isn’t a heavyweight in the competition, a couple of upgrades could improve the card a lot. Most importantly, the number of tasks of this SBC is reasonable, and it should be achievable for beginners and veterans alike.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Konrad Laimer Path to Glory SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="192" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Both tasks have unique conditions that will need to be satisfied during squad submission. To get Laimer’s PTG item, you’ll need to submit one 85-rated squad and one 88-rated squad.</p>
 <p data-characters="31" data-current-count="31" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – FC Bayern Munich</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="151" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players from: Bayern Munich</li> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min.

 <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-konrad-laimer-path-to-glory-sbc-cheapest-solutions" data-injectable="false"> EA FC 24 Konrad Laimer Path to Glory SBC cheapest solutions</h2> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-path-to-glory-upgrades-tracker/">EA FC 24</a></em> Konrad Laimer Path to Glory SBC is similar to the recently released <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-bradley-barcola-path-to-glory-sbc-solutions/">Barcola PTG challenge</a> – you can obtain a special card for a reasonable price. Go for the cheapest solutions to save in-game resources as much as possible, which could be then used elsewhere in Ultimate Team. </p> <p data-characters="31" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – FC Bayern Munich</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="766" data-injectable="true"> <li>Dani Parejo 86</li> <li>Cristiana Girelli 86</li> <li>Thomas Muller 84</li> <li>Nacho Fernandez 83</li> <li>Merle Frohms 85</li> <li>Koke 84</li> <li>Dabritz 84</li> <li>Thiago Alcantara 84</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Any 86-rated TOTW item</li> <li>Romelu Lukaku 84</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="25" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 2 – Bundesliga</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true"> <li>Irene Paredes: 88</li> <li>Victor Osimhen: 88</li> <li>Bernando Silva: 88</li> <li>Cucho Hernandez TOTS: 88</li> <li>Jan Oblak: 88</li> <li>Joshua Kimmich: 88</li> <li>Lucy Bronze: 87</li> <li>Lina Magull: 87</li> <li>Gianluigi Donnarumma: 87</li> <li>Lea Schuller: 86</li> <li>Mapi Leon: 89</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">After completing the challenge, you’ll obtain a 93-rated CDM item who can also operate at CM. I would use him purely as a defensive midfielder due to his playstyles and M/H work rate. While he’s pretty affordable as far as completion cost is concerned, he would need at least a couple of upgrades, if not more in the future. </p>
