<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is set to be released on February 4, introducing the world to one of the best RPGs slated for 2025. On social media and across the internet, gamers have been abuzz about the impending release, causing all manner of questions to surface about the open-world RPG.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’m addressing one of those questions: ‘Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 a sequel?’ That ‘2’ might be a bit of a giveaway, but let’s dive into the topic below and answer that question in full.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-set-after-kingdom-come">Is Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Set After Kingdom Come?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is a direct sequel to the first game. It’s set mere months after the ending of the first game, which was released in 2018. In Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, players assume control of Henry of Skalitz once again, slotting them into a very familiar perspective, provided they’ve played Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>KCD2 is as instant a follow-up game as you could ever hope to play. Many themes from the first game roll over into the second title, and it’s as though you’re picking the story up right where you left it at the end of Kingdom Come Deliverance.</p>



<p>That means you’ll recognise returning characters, and understand various plots and quests, and you’ll also be familiar with many of the game’s mechanics, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-lockpick-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lockpicking</a> or making potions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-saviour-schnapps-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Saviour Schnapps</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-first">Do You Need to Play Kingdom Come First?</h2>



<p>In 2018, Kingdom Come Deliverance was released to a popular enough reception, despite being a relatively gruelling and realistic game that punished average gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>This story-rich, open-world game turned heads because it was so immersive and such a faithful representation of the setting, leaning on real people, places, and events to enrich the game.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s not <strong>necessary </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-you-need-to-play-kingdom-come-deliverance-before-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to play the first Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> before Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. This is because the developer, Warhorse Studios, has done a remarkable job with the writing of the second game, working in flashback sequences, conversations that dive into the first game’s history, and nods to the story of the opening title.</p>



<p>If you’ve not played Kingdom Come Deliverance (2018), you should be fine starting with Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>That being said, the first game is stellar, and it shouldn’t be missed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘I Am a Living God of Video Games’: Elon Musk Has Admitted He Cheated in Diablo and PoE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-cheated-diablo-poe-admit/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98i-am-a-living-god-of-video-games%E2%80%99-elon-musk-has-admitted-he-cheated-in-diablo-and-poe.1087458/</guid>

<p>If you’re an avid social media user, you might have heard the debate recently regarding the ‘legitimacy’ of Elon Musk’s gaming successes. In recent weeks, claims from the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire surfaced, suggesting that he’s one of the top-ranked players in both games – and he appeared to have the numbers to back those claims up.</p>



<p>However, his bold claims attracted the attention of content creators familiar with the games he plays, and the holes in his story started to show quite quickly. In a follow-up conversation with a YouTuber named NikoWrex, Elon Musk admitted that he cheated in both games to get to where he is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dishonest-conduct">Dishonest Conduct</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Elon Musk is an avid gamer. In the summer of 2023, Musk appeared in a live chat on Twitter (which was still <strong>named </strong>Twitter back then) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started talking about his obsession</a> with Diablo 4, which had just been released at the time.</p>



<p>A couple of months later, he became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elon-musk-stream-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most instantly successful streamers</a>, broadcasting his Diablo 4 gameplay to a concurrent viewer count of more than <strong>1.3 million </strong>users. That act alone marked him as one of the most-watched streamers in history.</p>



<p>Since then, Musk’s gaming habits have been relatively public, and weeks ago, the topic of him being a ‘top 20 player’ in Diablo 4 surfaced once again. He was quickly investigated and called out by streamers like Asmongold, who promptly fell into a social media beef with the tech billionaire and close friend of President Trump.</p>



<p>Now, in a series of DMs exchanged between Elon Musk and NikoWrex, it has been confirmed that all this time, Elon Musk was cheating.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-elon-musk-cheating">How Was Elon Musk Cheating?</h2>



<p>A bunch of screenshots have surfaced online showcasing the full conversation between Elon Musk and NikoWrex (thanks, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/102692/elon-musk-confirms-he-cheated-to-become-top-player-in-path-of-exile-2-and-diablo-iv/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TweakTown</a>). In these screenshots, Musk admits that ‘it’s impossible to beat the players in Asia’ if you’re not <strong>sharing your account </strong>with other users.</p>



<p>Account sharing is a prohibited action under the terms of service for many online games, and if it isn’t, it’s a morally corrupt concept. It’s exactly what it sounds like – you share the details of your account with other users who play when you’re busy, sleeping, working, or something like that.</p>



<p>Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk does insist that he’s still a cracked gamer, though:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No matter how you cut it, a sub 2 min clear of the hardest level in Diablo is very fast. My run is posted to X. Very few mistakes were made.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the discourse, Elon Musk’s ex-wife took to social media to defend him, explaining:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first american druid in diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA.</p>



<p>He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However you think of his exploits in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile, it seems that Elon Musk is a talented gamer. </p>



<p>Do you think his actions are reprehensible, or should everyone chill on Elon Musk? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shroud-might-start-a-marvel-rivals-esports-org-because-he-loves-the-game.1087278/</guid>

<p>Marvel Rivals continues to turn heads since being released in December 2024. It has been a smash hit with tens of millions of players worldwide, which is aided by the fact that it’s a genuinely enjoyable, free-to-play hero shooter. NetEase is working hard to ensure the content pipeline remains stoked, and creators are locked in on the game.</p>



<p>One such creator is Shroud, one of the biggest streamers in the business. Recently, the former CSGO pro player gushed over Marvel Rivals and suggested he could be about to make an esports organisation focused exclusively on the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-jest-or-not">In Jest or Not</h2>



<p>Whether he was being serious or not remains to be seen, but if anyone can do it, Shroud can.</p>



<p>For years, Shroud has been one of the most popular streamers in the world, coming out of a relatively successful esports pro player career and opting to sit in front of the camera for years to follow. Today, he’s one of the biggest names in gaming.</p>



<p>During a recent stream, Shroud once again delved into his love for Marvel Rivals, explaining a potential goal for the near future:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we raise a certain amount of money, I’ll make a Marvel Rivals team, slash org.</p>



<p>This game might just be it.</p>



<p>I might have to set a donation goal, for this number to hit something, and <strong>I will make an org</strong> for Marvel Rivals only.</p>



<p>I might be playing this game for the rest of my life. I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>



<div><article><p><span>Shroud says he might make an org just so he can have a Marvel Rivals team 

“This game might just be it…I genuinely might be playing this game for the rest of my life”</span></p></article></div>







<p>Marvel Rivals boasts a solid foundation that would easily support a competitive ecosystem. For now, it’s tied almost exclusively to a ranked platform, but recently, Twitch Rivals hosted a <strong>Marvel Rivals </strong>tournament, which was more or less a first for the game.</p>



<p>In the past, Shroud has dominated the likes of Counter-Strike, Overwatch, and VALORANT, so edging into the Marvel Rivals space is nothing but familiar territory.</p>

<p>The VALORANT rivalry between North American teams Sentinels and 100 Thieves has always been hot, but it reached unhinged levels just one week into the 2025 season. After some spicy photos hit the timeline this past weekend though, the two organizations asked their outspoken stars to tone it down.</p>



<p>Still, those photos will be seared into our memory for some time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-and-100t-requested-the-images-be-taken-down">Sentinels and 100T “Requested” The Images Be Taken Down</h2>



<p>Prior to the highly anticipated match between Sentinels and 100 Thieves at VCT Americas, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/100t-valorants-boostio-says-nrg-cant-win-championships-with-fns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100T’s sparkplug in-game leader Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</a> posted a wild couple of photos on X. This included one of someone bent over in front of him wearing Sentinels’ Jordan “Zellsis” Montemurro’s jersey, with the caption “Banging @Sentinels today.”</p>



<p>However, it was Sentinels that got the last laugh, defeating 100 Thieves in three maps and knocking them down to the lower bracket of the VCT Americas Kickoff event. After the match, Boostio willingly posed in a similar bent-over position for Zellsis, who posted the image onto his Twitter account.</p>



<p>Eventually, both images were taken down, causing some on reddit to speculate that Riot forced the players to delete the photos. Some even claimed that both Zellsis and Boostio were fined for their tweets, but the Sentinels star has denied that speculation.</p>



<p>On X, Zellsis <a href="https://x.com/Zellsis/status/1881173481553101274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> “the internet [is] spreading misinformation as usual. I was not fined for that tweet, nor do I think Boostio was. The tweets were definitely out of pocket so Riot and our orgs politely requested we take them down.” Zellsis previously was fined by Riot Games back in 2023 for making a lewd gesture while on camera.</p>



<p>Should Zellsis and Boostio have received fines for their photos? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-updates-on-monster-hunter-wilds-performance-improvements-is-aiming-to-lower-pc-gpu-requirements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Excitement continues to mount ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' release next month, but if there's one big question mark around the whole thing, it's just what sort of performance improvements Capcom has been cooking up since its rather wobby public beta. And the publisher has now given a brief update on performance, alongside confirmation it's "looking into" lowering the game's recommended GPU requirements on PC.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds' first public beta went live last October, and it immediately became clear there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">still work to be done</a> on the performance front. Players soon took to the internet highlighting everything from erratic framerates, even on decently beefy PCs, to unfortunate visual glitches making the whole thing look like Capcom's lead platform was the N64.
</p>
<p>
At the time, the publisher moved to remind players Monster Hunter Wilds was "still in development", offering assurances the full game was "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test", and that it was "committed to ensuring the quality of the final product." There was hope among fans some of these improvements might be evident in Monster Hunter Wilds' second open beta, scheduled to run from 7th-9th February, but Capcom recently confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-gets-second-open-beta-ahead-of-february-release">that wouldn't be the case</a>.

<p>
The company has, though, now provided a short update on performance, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>'s <a href="https://x.com/DEMonsterHunter/status/1880661617249034446">official German social media channel</a> recently posting (as per Google translate) that the team "has been addressing rendering issues from the open beta test and is continually working on improvements for launch". These assurances were accompanied by a video offering what Capcom called a "look at our updated Prioritise Performance more for PS5", albeit not a particularly illuminating one given the less-than-stellar quality of X's video player. Prioritise Performance mode (AKA Prioritise Framerate) targets up to 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series X, compared to 30fps when using Prioritise Graphics mode.
</p><p>
Capcom also noted it's aiming to improve PC performance in a "similar way", and that it's additionally "looking into whether we can lower the recommended GPU requirements". The publisher raised a few eyebrows last September, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-revealed">revealed</a> Monster Hunter Wilds would require an RTX 2070 Super/RTX 4060/RX 6700XT to reach 60fps (with Frame Generation) at 1080p, so word there may be improvements here - particularly given the open beta's erratic performance on mid-range hardware - is encouraging.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 on 28th February, and the Character Creation, Story Trial and Slay Doshaguma Quest seen in last year's first open beta will all be available again when beta #2 kicks off earlier in the month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was quite taken with Monster Hunter Wilds' "familiar thrill of the hunt, player customisation, and extravagant combat" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">went hands-on in August</a>, so hopefully Capcom can iron our those remaining wrinkles before launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nacon-announces-nintendo-switch-2-accessories-expecting-switch-2-release-between-april-and-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report, NACON has announced their accessories that have been created with the Nintendo Switch 2 in mind. Just last week, people finally got their first look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">long-awaited Nintendo Switch 2</a>. While it didn't reveal many details, it has been confirmed that people will get more information about the upcoming console in April thanks to a special Nintendo Direct dedicated to the console. NACON is a French publisher and accessory creator and has confirmed that it already has a bunch of peripherals for gamers to purchase when the Nintendo Switch 2 officially releases.</p>
<p>While we don't know the official release date yet of the console, NACON is expecting a significant rise in sales in the first half of the fiscal year of 2025/26, as that is when they are expecting the official release of the Nintendo Switch successor. In the report, they have also confirmed that they have a number of games ready to be published for the Nintendo Switch 2. This information comes from a snippet of the <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1881421491285393857/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report posted on X by MauroNL</a>, which you can read for yourself on their social media.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can see the line-up of accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 on the official NACON website, where you can see everything from foldable driving wheels to carrying cases and tempered glass protectors. So far, there are 16 items listed on the website, all for very reasonable prices. While they can't be purchased yet, they will be open to purchase as soon as the Switch 2 releases.</p>
<p>It's likely that once the console releases, NACON will continue to make even more products for the console, including themed accessories such as Mario and Zelda-themed items.</p>
<p>In the snippet of the report posted by MauroNL, NACON says that their business levels will be boosted thanks to the games and accessories that were created in 2024/25 but weren't released in that period and will instead be released in 2025/26. There will also be a NACON Connect Event taking place on March 6, where they will be showcasing some of the games that they have planned for this year. According to the post, they have 10 new games ready to be published, which will all be released at different points throughout the year. The most significant games out of the bunch will be revealed during their special event on March 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24346199/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-koei-tecmo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In the doldrums of winter, I’ve reached for comfort media — which, for me, means Chinese historical dramas. And while the elaborate costumes and overly sweet romances are enjoyable, sometimes a girl wants something with a little more teeth. <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>has given me exactly what I needed.</p><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, developed by Koei-Tecmo’s Omega Force, adapts the famous Chinese historical novel <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</em> into knock down, drag out, 1 vs 100 style battles. This is the tenth game in the series, coming at a time when the <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> franchise <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/21/16348298/dynasty-warriors-9-news-tgs-2017-koei-tecmo-omega-force">had gotten a reputation for being stale</a>. After all, there’s only so many times you can retread the same story with the same characters and the same general gameplay without getting one note. <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins,</em> however, is a welcome refreshment over its predecessors.</p><div><figcaption>Cao Cao can always be counted on to put his ambition on display.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Koei-Tecmo</cite></p></div><p>After releasing <em>Dynasty Warriors 9</em> in 2018, Omega Force took a break from the series to work on licensed games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel"><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22303746/persona-5-strikers-review-ps4-pc-nintendo-switch-atlus-omega-force"><em>Persona 5 Strikers</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/8/23200053/fire-emblem-three-hopes-hack-and-slash-three-houses-nintendo-switch"><em>Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</em></a>. That detour through games that I felt were excellent applications of Omega Force’s brand of hack-and-slash action gave the studio the new perspective it needed to come back to its signature franchise and shake shit up.</p><p>In <em>Origins</em>, instead of bouncing between different characters during certain battles as you had in previous games, you witness the story through a single character named the Wanderer. You have no memory of yourself, and as you progress, you slowly regain your memories and special powers. The Wanderer can use any type of weapon, which is another welcome change from previous games that locked weapons to a certain character. Each weapon has abilities you unlock through continued use, and the Wanderer himself has skills and perks he unlocks via skill trees.</p><p>Combat in <em>Origins </em>is simple to get the hang of. You have a light attack and a heavy attack that can be modified by using your dodge or jump. There’s also a suite of abilities that consume a resource called “bravery” that you earn by landing hits on your opponent. Finally, there’s block and parry mechanics and an ultimate ability called “musou” used when you’re impossibly surrounded or need to put extra hurt on an enemy general.</p><p>While this all sounds like your standard hack-and-slash game, I was pleased <em>Origins</em> made me work for my victories. Even on the standard difficulty and with years of experience playing <em>Warriors</em> games, I couldn’t just blindly hack my way through enemies. Generals hit surprisingly hard, and if I wasn’t using my various abilities to mitigate or counter their attacks, they’d continuously generate shields I’d have to keep chewing through to take them down. Unfortunately, your allied generals, whose deaths can result in an automatic loss, are made of tissue paper, so the longer enemy generals are alive, the higher your chances are of losing a battle. </p><div><figcaption>It’s great fun knocking around scores of enemies as The Wanderer.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Koei-Tecmo</cite></p></div><p>Battles take place on large, winding maps stuffed with bases to take over and enemy generals to defeat. Even though defeating the enemy leader while keeping your own leaders alive is generally the only win condition, I <em>loved</em> being a completionist. When I got a panicked cry for help from my allies, it was fun rushing to their defense even if helping didn’t make the battle end sooner. It made me feel like a big damn hero. And isn’t that the whole point of a game that lets you fight alongside the legendary characters of Chinese history?</p><p>Playing the hero is the best part about <em>Origins</em> and what’s been sorely missing from the franchise. Earlier games were burdened with unnecessary systems like the atrocious, poorly-paced open world of <em>Dynasty Warriors 9 </em>or the no-thoughts, head-empty button mashing of<em> Dynasty Warriors 8. </em>But in <em>Origins</em>, executing a special ability pulled you into an elaborate cutscene with animations that look like they were ripped straight out of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia">wuxia</a> film. My choices in the game’s story moments let me build relationships with characters I have loved so much across so many different mediums. </p><p>I do understand other reviews’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/507137/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-pc-xbox-ps5">criticisms of the Wanderer</a>. As a character he has no personality to speak of, and his quest to regain his memories isn’t compelling. But I can easily overlook that because this is <em>Dynasty Warrior</em>s. All I’m here for, and what this game has given me in spades, is to eat meat buns and pursue Lu Bu — and I’m all out of meat buns.</p><p><small><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is out now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here-is-all-civilization-7-civilizations-coming-day-one-%E2%80%93-factions-guide.1087239/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-civilization-7-civilizations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a move that’s quite similar to Humankind, the relatively recent 4X strategy game that saw players leading a budding nation through history, Civilization 7 no longer requires you to pick a static faction and remain the same leader from start to finish. Instead, the game is divided into stages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. During these ages, you’ll evolve your faction from a lowly tribe to a powerhouse with nuclear missiles. Here is a look at all the Civilization 7 civilizations available on day one!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-factions-in-civilization-7-at-launch">All Factions in Civilization 7 at Launch</h2>



<p>As you progress through the various eras in Civilization 7, you’ll expand your empire, bolster your troops, and inevitably evolve your culture from one, such as the Greek, to the next, such as the Norman, before inevitably finishing the game in the modern era as, say, the Prussian. It’ll offer players many opportunities to customize the experience and ensure replayability for quite some time!</p>



<h3 id="h-antiquity">Antiquity</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Aksumite</strong></li>



<li><strong>Egyptian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Greek</strong></li>



<li><strong>Han</strong></li>



<li><strong>Khmer</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mauryan</strong></li>



<li><strong>Maya</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mississippian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Persian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Roman</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-exploration">Exploration</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Abbasid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Chola</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hawaiian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Inca</strong></li>



<li><strong>Majapahit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ming</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mongolian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Norman</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shawnee</strong></li>



<li><strong>Songhai</strong></li>



<li><strong>Spanish</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-modern">Modern</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>American</strong></li>



<li><strong>Buganda</strong></li>



<li><strong>Imperial French</strong></li>



<li><strong>Meiji Japanese</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mexican</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mughal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Prussian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qing</strong></li>



<li><strong>Russian</strong></li>



<li><strong>Siamese</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-will-we-see-additional-civilizations-in-dlc">Will We See Additional Civilizations in DLC?</h2>



<p>Most likely, yeah. While it’s not guaranteed that we will receive DLC and expansions for Civilization 7, it’s highly considering the franchise’s overall track record for additional content. In the last game, Civilization VI, players were treated to Portugal, Vietnam, Byzantium, Gaul, and the Maya, to name a few of the leader packs that launched post-release.</p>



<p>For Civilization VII, which launches on February 11, we suspect 2K and Firaxis Games want to offer players even more content, keeping everyone satisfied for years to come!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-cs2-settings-and-options.1087224/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-settings-and-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike 2 settings menu is filled to the brim with different options that can change your gameplay, for better or worse. Newer CS2 players may be overwhelmed and will resign to going with the settings recommended by your system. While these options are fine, they can be better.</p>



<p>These are the best CS2 settings we can recommend you try out for yourself.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-video-settings">Best CS2 Video Settings</h2>



<p>Display Mode, Aspect Ratio, and Resolution are very dependent on personal preference. Players that alt-tab during matches or tab over to a program like Spotify, Discord, or a browser will have a more fluid time playing on Fullscreen Windowed. However, playing on Fullscreen Windowed means you can’t alter Aspect Ratio or Resolution. <strong>Playing in 4:3 stretched resolution</strong> is very popular amongst pros and long-time competitive players, as the game feels smoother and character models look wider.</p>



<ul>
<li>Under Video Settings, switch to Fullscreen, 4:3 Original, and 1280×960. By default, you’ll have black bars on the sides of your screen but these can be removed.</li>



<li>Tab out of CS2, and open the NVIDIA Control Panel. Under Display, click Adjust desktop size and position. 
<ul>
<li>Set the Scaling mode to Full-screen</li>



<li>Select GPU under “Perform scaling on”</li>



<li>Keep your resolution native</li>



<li>Set the refresh rate to your monitor’s maximum</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>When you tab back into CS2, you should have the stretched resolution that so many players prefer.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-advanced-video-settings">Best CS2 Advanced Video Settings</h2>



<p>As for your Advanced Video Settings, your goal should be improving FPS, reducing lag, and making CS2 look as clear as possible. Under the Advanced Video tab of your CS2 settings menu, make the following changes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>V-Sync: </strong>Disabled</li>



<li><strong>Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode:</strong> None</li>



<li><strong>Global Shadow Quality: </strong>Very High</li>



<li><strong>Model/Texture Detail: </strong>Medium</li>



<li><strong>Texture Filtering Mode: </strong>Anisotropic 16X</li>



<li><strong>Shader Detail: </strong>Low</li>



<li><strong>Particle Detail:</strong> Medium</li>



<li><strong>Ambient Occlusion: </strong>Disabled</li>

<p><strong>Did you know Escape From Tarkov has in-game achievements?</strong> Despite playing since Factory was the only available map, I didn’t for the longest time. It’s true, though. As part of the 0.14 content update, EFT now offers achievements. Some remain hidden; others are common enough to score during casual play. Here’s a look at all of them!</p>



<h2 id="h-all-achievements-in-escape-from-tarkov">All Achievements in Escape From Tarkov</h2>



<p>Escape From Tarkov features a ton of achievements, but don’t expect them to unlock anything special, like in-game rewards or transfer over to Steam if the game ever launches on Valve’s digital storefront. They’re primarily for show, a bit of bragging rights as you complete raid after raid, losing all of your equipment…is that just me?</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend Studio says it "still plans on creating cool shit", following Sony's decision to cancel its unannounced live-service game - amid claims Bend and the similarly affected Bluepoint only found out about the cancellations "at the same time as everyone else".
</p>
<p>
Word that Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two more first-party live service games</a> - this time in development at its Bend and Bluepoint studios - emerged via by Bloomberg last week. Sony, of course, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">plans to invest heavily in live service titles</a> back in 2022, under the watch of then-PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, but the company has cancelled numerous live service games - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-op Spider-man from developer Insomniac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at Firesprite</a> - since Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">departure last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the latest casualties of Sony's apparent strategic rethink, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Bluepoint had been developing an unannounced live service God of War game. And while no details of Bend's canned project were shared, the studio previously said it was working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone". It's unclear, however, if this is the same game that's now been axed.

<p>
Regardless, Bend has now broken its silence following the news, thanking fans for their support and offering assurances it's not done yet. "I'll keep this short," Bend community manager Kevin McAllister wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623">message shared on social media</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit."
</p><p>
As to what's next for Bluepoint and Bend, that remains uncertain. According to journalist Jeff Grubb in his latest Game Mess Mornings video show (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bluepoint-and-bend-staff-learned-their-live-service-ps5-games-were-cancelled-at-the-same-time-as-everyone-else/">VGC</a>), both teams have had little time to process the news. "The two studios found out at the same time as everyone else," Grubb told listeners, "so people will be going into work today wondering, 'Hey, okay, what are we doing next?'. And what they're going to have to do next, very likely, is pitch something to Sony, and the landscape of that has changed pretty drastically.”
</p>
<p>
"A couple of years ago," he continued, "you'd bring to PlayStation your pitch, that is: 'It's a live service game, we know you want to hear that'... And now they have to go back to the drawing board, and come up with a pitch that PlayStation wants to hear, when no one really knows what they want to hear, and so it's a rough situation."
</p>
<p>
<em><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has weighed on Grubb's claims, calling them "not true". In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lg6yoxuvs22e">post on BlueSky</a>, Shreier wrote, "People across the org were informed [of the cancellations] before my article went out last week." Sony is yet to respond to Eurogamer's request for comment, but we'll updated the story if it provides clarity on the situation.</em>
</p>
<p>
Following last week's cancellations, Sony told Bloomberg "neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down", adding that the "highly accomplished teams" would be "working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects".
</p>
<p>
Sony's continuing shift away from live service titles follows the high-profile failure of last year's Concord, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its launch</a> amid low player numbers. Back in 2023 it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">company was "uncomfortable"</a> about former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's decision to focus heavily on live service games.

The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game, according to Bloomberg’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jason Schreier</u></a>. Bend Studio’s live-service game remains unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sony spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to Bloomberg, adding that neither studio will be closed and that it will work with each to determine next projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's live-service push has struggled significantly. While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live-service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid drastically low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer. The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he would have tried to resist Sony’s controversial live-service video game push</a>, were he in the position of current Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister issued a short message to the developer's fans: “Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, Bend Studio's last release was 2019’s Days Gone on PlayStation 4. It launched on PC in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company had learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year and Concord’s failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation “much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently we are still in the process of learning,” Totoki admitted. “Basically, with regards to new IP, of course you don’t know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki was that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord’s issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch — or canceled it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony’s “siloed organization” and Concord’s release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,” Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We launched two live-service games this year,” he said. “Helldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games — which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP — with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie’s Marathon, Guerrilla’s Horizon Online, and Haven Studio’s Fairgame$.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

They chose to make it so good, and so comprehensive, that it removed the need to make any more. It has now been over ten years since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> first released, more than double the length that’s ever come between an entry in the series before. Honestly, they could re-re-release <em>8</em> for the Switch 2, and it’d still sell millions. Given this, here’s an idea: why not do something <em>dramatically </em>different with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196001" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>All I’m saying is make it into an RPG.</p><p>It’s really hard to underline properly how unprecedented is the success of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This game was first released for the Wii U in 2014, then re-released for the Switch in 2017 as <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Now, it was an embellished version, with all previous DLC, new characters, let you hold two items, and a rejuvenated battle mode, but it was still very much the same game. The Wii U version is thought to have sold almost 8.5 million copies, and the Switch release is one of the best-selling games ever made, at an astonishing 64 million copies. With frequent new content, and endless fixes and tweaks, the game is still receiving patches even since what appears to be its final content update when it hit version 3.0.0 in November 2023.</p><p>It’s been such a phenomenon that Nintendo has very wisely not attempted to usurp it, doubling the longest ever gap between entries, the previous longest stretch being from 1996's <em>Mario Kart 64</em> to 2001's GBA title, <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em>. And listen, remember when Nintendo formerly announced the Switch 2 last week, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">everyone spent a couple of hours arguing over whether the game footage shown was <em>Mario Kart 8</em> or something new</a></span>? People seemed like they’d be happy with just some more of <em>8</em>.</p><p>So why not? May as well just tip that numeral over and call it <em>Mario Kart ∞</em>. Add a whole bunch more tracks, update something else, call it a day. And for <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, let’s go deep.</p><p>One of my all-time favorite games is 2004's <em>Mario Golf: Advance Tour</em>. I have never played a real game of golf in my life, and have no interest in golf games in general, but that Game Boy Advance game was utter joy from start to finish. You played as one of two kids, Neil or Ella, who join the Marion Clubhouse as potential star golf students. There you meet an eclectic mix of humans and <em>Mario</em> characters, with the ultimate aim of beating Mario himself in the final championship. And it’s wonderful! Utterly bonkers, with splendid writing, the vast majority of the time you’re actively playing the core golf game, but all within a narrative, and surrounded by RPG elements.</p><p>When developers Camelot returned with 2014's <em>Mario Golf: World Tour</em>, I was so excited! Ten years later there was to be another entry! And then I found out this was a follow-up to the GameCube’s <em>Toadstool Tour</em>, no RPG at all, and I went off and sulked. I went through much the same in 2021 with <em>Mario Golf: Super Rush</em>. I’m still sulking now. But I still hold hope in my heart. I still believe that every single <em>Mario</em> game can be massively improved by being an RPG. So let me sell you on this idea for <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You pick a character, whether it’s a Neil or an Ella or a Toad, and you get your first kart. You have just arrived at the Marion Gran Prix Academy, a location that has four local racetracks, Luigi Raceway, Moo Moo Farm, Koopa Troopa Beach and Kalimari Desert. You’re tasked with completing various training races, learning skills like jumping and skidding, as well as how best to use the various item drops. Once you’ve completed these tasks, you can take part in each track’s big race, and once you’ve won trophies in all four, you unlock access to the next site, the one that has Toad’s Turnpike, Frappe Snowland, Choco Mountain, and Mario Raceway.</p><p>Along the way, you gain levels, letting you spend points in speed, drift, bounce, steering, and the all-important luck. You develop your character according to your own preferred approach to <em>Mario Kart</em>, the relatively minor tweaks letting you lean in to your own skills.</p><p>Each site has <em>Mario</em> characters scattered about, people to talk with, little secrets to discover. And each has its own unique bonus rounds, time trials, and extra challenges. The ultimate goal is, of course, to beat Mario on the Rainbow Road, but that’s a distant dream when you begin. You’ll need to have developed your kart into something really special to manage that, tweaked its brakes and drift to your ideal settings, and gained the best skills in a starting boost.</p><p>Obviously this is the greatest idea anyone has ever had, but alongside my rightfully being given a million-billion dollars and a crown, I imagine there are a few ne’er-do-wells who would argue, “But I want a PROPER <em>Mario Kart 9</em>!” That’s because they didn’t read the first half of this perfect argument properly, and realize they just already have it. It’s <em>Mario Kart Infinite</em>, remember? When Nintendo is building me my throne made of Master Swords, I’ll remind them they have to make that Switch 2 upgrade for <em>8</em>/<em>Infinite</em>, with the handful of new tracks, and that’ll keep them distracted while the rest of us have <em>the best time ever</em>.</p><p>Glad we could get this sorted.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still on the way. That’s according to the game’s developer Team Cherry over the weekend. </p>



<p>In a reply to a fan wondering if the game is progressing or if the developers had “given up on the project”, the game’s head of marketing and publishing, Matthew Griffin, gave a short answer to the question.</p>



<p>“Yes the game is real, progressing and will release,” <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>, following it up with a heart. </p>



<p>While it’s not the update fans are waiting for from a  game that was officially announced in 2019, it’s still something from a team that’s been quite silent up to this point. Originally set to be an expansion to the first game, Silksong turned into a full-fledged sequel during its development. According to Team Cherry, it will feature over 165 new enemies and 100 different benches. </p>



<p>The game sees you play as Hornet, who has been captured and taken to an “unfamiliar land” where she has to fight her way out to get “to the kingdom’s peak”.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>, in addition to the new enemies and additional benches, Silksong will feature a branch new Kingdom, a new original soundtrack, a challenge mode, new movement mechanics, and new weapons to learn. </p>



<p>The game was originally planned for a 2023 release, but development kept it in the oven. Since then, however, there’s been no hint as to when it could be coming. When it does finally release, Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. </p>

But that’s exactly what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans are excited to uncover with the release of guest character Conan the Barbarian this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s back up for a bit. Mortal Kombat is perhaps most famous for its various ninjas. Everyone knows Sub-Zero is blue and Scorpion is yellow. Ermac is red and Rain is purple (you see what they did there?). But there's no pink ninja, which is where Pink Floyd come in. Floyd is the name given to a rumored pink ninja supposedly buried within the bowels of Mortal Kombat 1, just waiting to be discovered. NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon has teased fans on multiple occasions by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character called Floyd.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes. I honestly want to make a PINK ninja and name him FLOYD. No kidding.</p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1577123361498759168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it looks like Floyd may finally become a reality inside Mortal Kombat 1. Recently released gameplay showing off Conan the Barbarian includes a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it 'Floyd' pop up in pink text displayed on the left of the screen. Bemused fighting game YouTuber Super, whose <a href="https://youtu.be/-pvxw2aRT9o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early access Conan gameplay</a> contained the Floyd name, took to social media to express their excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Listen closely and you’ll hear a guitar riff play alongside the Floyd pop-up during the Conan victory cutscene. Super had no idea how they activated it and couldn’t replicate it, but Mortal Kombat 1 fans are determined to get to the bottom of this mystery as soon as Conan comes out tomorrow.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The secret floyd fight in MK1 is coming with conan. I somehow activated it but didn't actually go into the match. I tried to get it again but was not successful. </p><p>Watch the full early access conan video here <a href="https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C</a> <a href="https://t.co/LqfFOyK2ZL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LqfFOyK2ZL</a></p></div>— Super (@lSuper_) <a href="https://twitter.com/lSuper_/status/1880317510081536378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it’s quite possible there <em>is </em>no secret Pink Floyd fight to activate, and this Floyd tease is just that: a tease. Boon is known for trolling Mortal Kombat fans, and the series is packed with pop culture references and in-jokes that go nowhere. You’d expect dataminers like TheThiny will work it if anything related to Floyd has changed when the Conan update kicks in, but players will still have to discover the activation, if it even exists.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">More details about the secret Floyd Fight:<br>The Floyd Easter egg triggers randomly at any stage. Once the icon pops up it plays a Guitar Riff (Pink Floyd reference?).<br>I believe you have to do a certain action / challenge at that time.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/bFGzCcbWp3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bFGzCcbWp3</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1880448153931116719?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and the aforementioned Conan the Barbarian.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyclopean-the-great-abyss">Cyclopean: The Great Abyss</a> appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a>-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?
</p><!--more-->
<p>

For now, I must wander the catacombs in pitch blackness, navigating by way of the minimap and the sound of my character walking into walls. Sometimes I walk into a ghast, Dark Sentinel, or other Lovecraftian hoodlum. I'm sure the monsters are hideous but again, I can't see them, and the turn-based combat sound effects are oddly cartoonish - generally, it sounds like I'm punching a snowman. I realise "never show the monster" is a cardinal rule of horror, but I think you're allowed a peek when the creature is munching on your face.
</p>
<p>
Oh how I wish I could see the monsters of Cyclopean: The Great Abyss, because this feels like a promising cosmic horror game, not least because it's also a minimalist, mildly sandboxy exercise in retro RPG mechanics - hardly "cyclopean" at all, but certainly enticing.</p>
<p>It casts you as an English aristo of some kind who has dreamt their way into the Great Abyss, and must search for a way back to the Waking World. You begin by rolling your stats and equipment - a really rubbish dagger and some protective rags, in my experience. Then off you trot to get your soul sucked by a Moon Beast. The overworld appears to be fixed, but I've encountered different dungeon layouts when revisiting the site of my previous character's death. Beasties aside, there are doors with pickable locks, treasure chests and, best of all, spike traps. I have triggered many a trap in my time with the demo. Fortunately, you can't trigger them repeatedly.
</p><p>
Cyclopean came out in early access this month. The current build supports the core elements of combat, stealth and dialogue. It can be played from start to end with three potential endings. All going to plan, the 1.0 version will launch in six months and feature more elaborate quests, more elaborate NPC interactions, and a more elaborate sanity system. I haven't had a chance to see what happens when you go insane because I can't see anything and I keep stepping on spikes and I keep dying. It's hard to descend into madness when you have all the base survivability of a mosquito in a microwave.
</p>
<p>
Developers Schmidt Workshops are, in fact, a single person from Chicago, Illinois. Their past creations include Islands Of The Caliph, "an old-school inspired action RPG based on Middle Eastern folklore and Islamic spiritual tradition". Given that precedent, I'm curious about how they're going to navigate the usual problem here of Lovecraft being a big smelly racist. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958790/Cyclopean_The_Great_Abyss/">find the demo on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA and DICE have been accused of using photos from the war in Gaza in artwork for Battlefield 2025. </p>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/emadalden_/status/1881045891009929516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EmadAlden</a> spotted the similarity when looking at the promotional artwork. Another user, <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1881050549455659026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DANNYonPC</a>, made the claim that the company is using photos from attacks on Gaza in the imagery. </p>



<p>“Damn, DICE is using pictures from attacks on Gaza in their BF2025 artwork,” the post reads. It then shows the photo in question from a bombing in Gaza dated May 12, 2021 taken by Reuters.</p>



<p>You can see the images yourself below for comparison.</p>

<p>While it’s unlikely it was done with intent or malice, it’s no question a decision that many could view as questionable. Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple contacts at EA for comment on the claims and the usage of real conflict for its artwork. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>
