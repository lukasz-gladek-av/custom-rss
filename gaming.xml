<p>First up is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> which debuts at numbers 5, 7, and 8 for the Switch, PS5, and Switch 2 respectively. Combining the sales yields a total of 31,770, which puts the game just behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> at 37,502. A decent start for the sequel, then, despite some middling reviews.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> enters the ring at number 3 with 23,292 sales on PS5. This one has been getting some great reception for its multiplayer, however the single-player campaign is generally regarded as being a bit lacking by comparison.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uvqjzk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is also maintaining decent sales, adding another 20,083 to its running total. Truth be told, we're eager to see how everything looks next week once sales for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are accounted for – we reckon Little Nightmares III probably won't be sticking around for very long, that's for sure.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Switch 2 has once again topped the hardware charts with another 46,942 units sold, while all three SKUs for the OG Switch combine to make a total of 23,149. Meanwhile, the combined sales for the PS5 total 14,800, resulting in a comfortable win for Nintendo's previous-gen hardware.</p>
<p>We suspect the Switch 2 sales will skyrocket next week with the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but it'll be interesting to see whether OG Switch sales also see a bit of an uptick. We reckon they'll all get a pretty solid boost.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-calls-tencent%E2%80%99s-defense-of-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-%E2%80%9Dnonsense%E2%80%9D.1326541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In November 2024, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram, an MMO that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">to practically everyone's eyes, including ours</a>, looked like a carbon-copy clone of PlayStation and Guerrilla Games' Horizon series. It was so evident that when Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">over the game and called it a "<em>slavish clone</em>,"</a> no one was surprised.</p>



<p>After making significant changes to Light of Motiram's Steam page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/">including removing certain screenshots and changing the game's description,</a> all to seemingly make it look more vague and less directly like a Horizon rip-off, Tencent fired back at Sony with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">even Guerrilla Games admitted that Horizon wasn't an original idea in the first place</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Sony has fired right back at Tencent. In a new filing first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post,</a> Sony directly calls Tencent's defence "<em>nonsense</em>," and that Tencent's continued promotion of Light of Motiram has already inflicted the damage Sony cites in its copyright suit.</p>



<p>"<em>Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued. This is nonsense. The damage is done, and it continues."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct</em>."</p>



<p>The suit goes on to claim that Tencent even tried to dodge liability "<em>by playing a shell game with its brands and entities</em>." Tencent (or more specifically Tencent Holdings), according to Sony, is the one Sony should be suing, because Tencent owns the IP to Light of Motiram, the US trademark for the game, and the official website. Tencent Holdings is also the parent of Tencent Games, so it's appropriate for Sony to go directly after Tencent Holdings, in Sony's view.</p>



<p>Tencent claimed that Sony shouldn't be suing Tencent Holdings, but Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios, the teams developing and publishing Light of Motiram. Both Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios are subsidiaries of Tencent.</p>



<p>"<em>After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities. Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram, without distinguishing between subsidiaries.</em> <em>Insofar as Tencent Holdings is in fact operating the gaming business through subsidiaries, it is controlling them. Tencent Holdings' senior management includes Ma Xiaoyi, who Tencent Holdings represents</em> <em>'is responsible for international publishing of Tencent Games.'"</em></p>



<p>For good measure, the new filing calls out once again how public response to Light of Motiram was to directly call it a Horizon knock-off, and went even further to call the game not just copyright, but trademark infringement over the red-haired protagonist that features in Light of Motiram's reveal. The character Aloy is a symbol of the PlayStation and Sony brand, the company argues, and Tencent's own red-haired "<em>lookalike</em>" was "<em>so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans noted the striking similarities between the ALOY Character Mark and Tencent's use of the Aloy lookalike, stating Tencent's lookalike 'resembles Aloy to a tee, red hair and all.'"</em></p>



<p>Sony even quoted one journalist who said, "<em>If someone told me this is a spin-off of [Horizon], I would easily believe them</em>."</p>



<p>Now, Sony wants the court to dismiss Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and go straight into the discovery phase, so Sony can begin digging through Tencent's files regarding Light of Motiram and its development, in the hopes of discovering evidence it can use to further argue that Tencent is committing copyright infringement with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>However this suit ends, it'll definitely set an interesting precedent for future copyright cases in games. We'll continue to follow it and provide updates as they come.

            <p>The lawyers in Sony and Tencent's ongoing legal fracas over alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> homework-copier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> continue to dish out the words. Letters, phrases, and sentences are being flung to and fro with reckless abandon. Sony are the latest corp to take a swing, not only calling Tencent's defense "nonsense", but accusing the Chinese conglomerate of playing shell company hide-and-seek.</p>
<p>If you need to catch up on the tale of this copyright clash, it began in July, when Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">brought about legal action</a> accusing Tencent-published post-apocalyptic open worlder Light of Motiram of being a "slavish clone" of their Horizon series. Tencent battled back, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-accuse-sony-of-trying-to-fence-off-a-well-trodden-corner-of-popular-culture-with-their-horizon-copyright-lawsuit">filing a motion to dismiss the case</a> last month. "Sony's effort is not aimed at fighting off piracy, plagiarism, or any genuine threat to intellectual property," Tencent claimed at the time. "It is an improper attempt to fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Fast forward to now and Sony taking a chance to respond to that defense in a court filing spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a>. "Tencent remarkably contends SIE’s claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram’s release until 2027 after SIE sued,” Sony's complaint reads. "This is nonsense. The damage is done - and it continues."</p>
<p>The delay referenced, which has seen Tencent push the Polaris Quest-developed game to the end of 2027, came alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-quietly-updates-slavish-horizon-clone-light-of-motirams-steam-page">revamp of Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> which happened to ditch some elements accused of Horizon similarities.</p>
<p>Sony also accuse Tencent of deliberately trying to muddy the waters when it comes to who's responsible for Light of Motiram, and therefore should be the main target of the lawsuit. The suit's been aimed at Tencent America, Proxima Beta U.S, and Tencent Holdings, but Tencent have previously claimed that this is a case of barking up the wrong trees in a forest of subsidiaries. In response, Sony have now accused Tencent of using their labyrinthine and multi-armed nature in an attempt to avoid taking responsibility for a game Sony claim got the thumbs up all the way up the chain.</p><p>"Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</p>
<p>"Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that ‘own[s] Aurora Studios’ — the Light of Motiram development studio," they added. "Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram — without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p>
<p>I assume that reading through this echoes how it'd feel to watch two Ancient Greek titans battle. Each entity calling upon their unspeakable mass and power which mortals can scarcely comprehend, as they grapple like sumo wrestlers amid shaking mountains and boiling seas. Guttural roars and exhalings of breath that blow away villages rain down, as the possession of the thing is decided. Both wronged in their own minds, ruthlessly fighting the side to which fate has assigned them.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's something to think about while lamenting the fact that this titanic tussle is basically two sets of very boring lawyers passing about bits of paper and counseling frowny execs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We just zoomed right on by Amazon’s final Prime member sales even of the year. We’re now in a bit of a no man’s zone before we get to Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. And yet, even though we’re in this deals desert, it’s not impossible to find an oasis of savings if you look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/">Like right now, Amazon has this Kamrui mini PC going for 19% off. It’s normally priced at $209, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for just $169</a>. That works out to a savings of $40.</p>
<p>Taking a peak under the tiny hood of this 2025 Kamrui mini PC, you’ll find a Twin Lake-N N150 four-core, four-thread processor with an integrated graphics card. Among that, you’ll also see 16GB of RAM and a full 512GB SSD for file storage. If that’s not enough for your needs, the M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD slot is expandable to up to 2TB. With these specs, you can expect a quick system startup time and fast loading of your documents and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As far as connectivity goes, the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC is equipped with a multi-functional interface that include two USB-A 3.2 ports, two USB-A 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, plus audio intake and outtake. The HDMI and DisplayPort together means you can connect to two different displays at once. It’s capable of displaying in up to 4K.</p>
<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>So the obvious appeal of a mini PC its its footprint. The Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC measures in at only 3.96 inches long and wide and 1.57 inches tall. That shakes out to only about one tenth the size of a standard desktop PC. The ultra-compact form factor means you can dedicate more of your desk to other things like your books or perhaps a second monitor.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a multimedia hub for a home theater. Sure, most TVs nowadays come with smart features, and even if yours doesn’t, streaming sticks are cheap to come by. That said, a mini PC can provide you with more versatility as its running Window. Thus, you’ll have a wider range of formats supported when playing videos locally or from a PLEX server. Heck, the mini PC itself can serve as your PLEX server if you wish.</p>
<p>Save yourself a solid $40 for a limited time when you pick up the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Staring at another low-battery warning just when you’re about to leave home is the kind of modern frustration no one needs: A reliable wall charger (with several ports) has quietly become one of those gadgets we can’t go a day without. That’s where the <em>Baseus</em> 100W USB‑C wall charger comes in, and right now it’s sitting at an all‑time low price on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">three‑port power block has dropped to just $34, down from $49.99</a>, as Amazon clears out the last of its post–Prime Day stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, and a Compact Build</h2>
<p>The <em>Baseus</em> version produces <strong>up to 100W of charging juice in the form of a single USB-C outlet</strong>, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to nearly full charge in roughly an hour and a half. It’s <strong>PD 3.0 protocol compatible</strong> meaning it speaks the same charging “language” that most current laptops, tablets, and phones speak so you get the maximum speed you can get without heating up your devices.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>its prongs are collapsible so it easily fits in a pocket or laptop sleeve</strong> and takes up very little real estate in a carry-on. It’s meant for the frequent flier or commuter who wouldn’t be interested in having some battery brick taking up valuable space on the wall or acting as luggage dead weight. And in the form of a charger for its rated capacity, it packs well – only slightly larger than your average single‑port telephone adapter.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling with having to tote up multiple chargers or are tired of lugging a laptop brick with you, the <em>Baseus</em> 100W wall charger is more than worth snapping up at this all-time low right now. Offers like this almost never stay around after the last batch goes through them, and this one hits almost all the right buttons.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast 11-Week Content Roadmap Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-content-roadmap/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast-11-week-content-roadmap-revealed.1326520/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Techland has once again proven that Dying Light: The Beast isn’t ‘just a DLC’ and offered up a stunning 11-week-long roadmap packed with content. We knew ahead of launch that this wouldn’t be a fire-and-forget game and that Techland had things in the pipeline, but now we know exactly what those things are.</p>



<p>Nestled amongst the coming updates sits New Game+, ‘Legend Levels’, Nightmare Difficulty, and almost a dozen week-long challenges under the ‘Call of The Beast’ title.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-doesn-t-end-with-the-release">Dying Light: The Beast Doesn’t End with the Release</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has stacks of content coming in a series of updates, as revealed today by Techland.</p>



<p>It begins with New Game+, Legend Levels (like the games that came before), and Nightmare Difficulty, for those who want a more tantalizing challenge in the open-world environment of Castor Woods.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there’s a PUBG Mobile collaboration (didn’t see that coming), a ray tracing update for PC, new weapon executions and animations, and visual and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Call of the Beast community challenge pipeline was also unveiled, with <strong>eleven weeks </strong>of challenges scheduled to run from today, October 16, to January 7. Each week, players will be able to complete a series of challenges, with special, ‘legendary’ rewards being added on weeks four, eight, and after the final week ends.</p>



<p>Techland said in a new release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the campaign, players around the world will take on weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the power of the Dying Light community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear directly in participants’ in-game stash once objectives are met. From new weapons to unique car skins, every week brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success of the community.To get the weekly rewards, players will need to contribute to the goal that week.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they began taking part in Call of the Beast!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This breathes more life into the game that some wrote off for being ‘too short’. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/">In my review</a>, I put that to rest and stressed just how much meat is on the bones of this game.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you intend to complete all the coming challenges in Dying Light: The Beast.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In an open letter, EA employees have publicly criticized the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">proposed $55 billion sale to an investor consortium</a>, warning that the deal could have dire consequences for the people who make EA's games. The letter comes as EA prepares to go private under the new ownership of Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, pending regulatory approval.</p><p>"EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed," the employees posted on the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout" rel="nofollow ">United Videogame Workers union website</a>, referencing fears that EA will undergo mass layoffs as part of its plans to finance its new debt. "We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p><p>The letter also called on regulators and elected officials to heavily scrutinize the deal to ensure that jobs will be protected if it's approved. At the same time, the CWA is also preparing to organize its members if and when ownership of the company changes hands, in an effort to protect EA's employees. "As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry," the letter concluded.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">have also taken note of the buyout</a>, and they recently co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, listing their fears that Saudi Arabia's ownership might pose a "national security" risk. Over the last couple of years, the PIF has made numerous investments--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">or outright purchases</a>--in several video game companies as part of plans to diversify its economy, including stakes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabias-400-billion-wealth-fund-invests-in-ea-activision-blizzard-and-take-two/1100-6487651/">Activision Blizzard, Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/">Embracer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-5-of-nintendo/1100-6503575/">Nintendo</a>.</p><p>The country also struck a 12-year pact with the International Olympic Committee to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a>, and WWE Wrestlemania 43 will also be hosted in the country in 2027.

The initial release period garnered 200,000 concurrent players. Yet, the company, which both developed and published the title, has been unable to maintain that initial user base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer at Tokyo Game Show, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The First Descendant</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Min Seok Joo and producer Beom-Jun Lee shared insights about the challenges of balancing a live service game, and dealing with feedback from completely opposite corners of the player base.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Continuing with the example of an overpowered Descendant, in cases like this, Lee said there's usually feedback from two main groups of users. Some would argue the team needs to reduce the power, while the other would argue otherwise and ask to maintain the current status. The trick is figuring out how to deal with these two contending groups.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-capcom-designed-resident-evil-requiem-with-different-camera-angles-in-mind" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Capcom designed Resident Evil Requiem with different camera angles in mind</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“In reality, we can't downpower the Descendant, [as] that will do a very big damage to the game, because the users who do not like this will leave, so we can't do that,” he said. “So in order to meet the needs of both groups, we have to improve the power of the other Descendants. In order to improve the power of all the other Descendants, that takes more time and energy than planned.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lee added that players generally want to progress faster, and the team is constantly listening to their “needs and wants” to try and incorporate their feedback. But once they receive said feedback, they have to digest it before incorporating it, which takes additional time. All the while, the team also needs to consider the greater scheme of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Joo called this a “wave” that can push the team to unplanned directions. “All this feedback, it all comes together, and then it kind of gives us the pressure to move towards a certain direction that we hadn't intended in the beginning,” he said. “So that changes our plan, and in order to make that kind of change, we have to adjust our schedule and we have to change our priority. So I think that is the difficult part about live service games.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation">Balancing player feedback is a delicate operation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite all of this, Joo said the team doesn't have a hard and fast rule about deciding on changes based on feedback. Sometimes it can be an idea or concern from one person, but one that could be quite meaningful. Other times, a large number of players could be demanding the same thing—even if the team didn't initially plan to make that change, these cases can make them reconsider it.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/cycling-through-the-open-world-design-of-wheel-world" target="_self" data-discover="true">Cycling through the open-world design of Wheel World</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside looking at and digesting data, the team also leans on its intuition to decide where to put more emphasis. Balancing these two elements is key to try to maintain the original direction of the game and not steer away from the developers' intentions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I think the gist of live service games is you have to serve two different groups in a parallel manner,” Joo said. “In other words, the existing users, we need to provide them with the new things that they can play with, so they will be the backbone. And then we also need to bring in the new players who can catch up very quickly so they can join the existing players. Between these two, we can't say that one is more important than the other. It has to go hand in hand.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that the operation of a free-to-play live service game is “very difficult,” with the biggest thing being that the team's intentions and the actual results don't match sometimes, receiving feedback that pushes things in a completely different direction. “It was actually quite stressful on our side, and I think that is the most difficult part about a free-to-play game.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/baby-steps-has-me-questioning-my-entire-existence" target="_self" data-discover="true">Baby Steps has me questioning my entire existence</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Yes, and while we provide the live service, we're actually preparing for future updates at the same time,” Lee said. “But when we are having this live service, we get live feedback, and so we try to deal with things that we haven't really expected. But at the same time, we need to prepare for the future as well. So it's very difficult for us to allocate the resources.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

            <p>You may have noticed your Conquest matches in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> have been getting shorter recently. Well, you're not imagining things! As part of an intentional tweak by Battlefield Studios, the starting ticket counter has been significantly reduced across the board for the popular game mode.</p>
<p>For those unaware or in need of a reminder, Conquest is one of Battlefield's most popular modes that's been included in every game in the series. It tasks an attacking team with capturing objectives before time or their allocated number of tickets (revives) runs out.
</p>
<p>As for why, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">an official statement posted on the Battlefield Comms X account</a> revealed a desire from the team to improve the pacing of the Conquest, as matches were hitting the time limit more than they'd like.</p>

<p>The post reads: "We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace. Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p>As a result of these changes, the standardised starting count of 1,000 tickets per team has been sliced down to a smaller figure, with each map getting its own tailored starting ticket count. For example, Siege of Cairo has been knocked down to 900 tickets, while Mirak Valley has been cut down to a stunning 700 tickets! This way, Conquest matches on these maps shouldn't drag as much as they did.</p>
<p>The response to this has been mixed however. While a portion of the community agrees this is a genuine problem, <a href="https://x.com/wiz_political/status/1978478913643802831">welcoming the change</a>, others have wondered <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1978476272327201258">why the time limit on Conquest matches wasn't increased or outright removed instead</a>. There's certainly a portion of the Battlefield playerbase keen for long big team battles, and lowering the ticket count could take away from their preferred game mode.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a series of quick fixes that have come to Battlefield 6 in the days following its full release. Adjustments to the movement system <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">killed a certain interaction between jumping momentum and your equipped weapon</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-issues-free-premium-battlefield-6-season-passes-to-ea-app-pre-orderers-frozen-out-of-the-game">free premium battle passes were handed out to EA App users due to launch issues</a>.</p>
<p>Incoming fixes are on the way too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">including a tweak to weapon bloom to improve aim during sustained fire</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the approaching death of "Ladder Launching"</a>. All in all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">it looks as though a lot of alterations are coming to one of the biggest Steam launches of all time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Having had a great time with the dungeon-crawling digital board gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">Demeo</a> a few years ago, a sequel was naturally high on my wishlist. That it comes with a full D&amp;D license, as opposed to featuring home brand versions of fantasy staples, just makes Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked all the more exciting.</p>
<p>OK, so the title’s a bit too much, but I can live with that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWXrLKOSmJ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>At the heart of Battlemarked is the same style of digital board game adventuring as Demeo. This is a simplified riff on the genres that has you playing attack and ability cards with deterministic outputs, so long as the die rolls in your favour. Additionally, since this is now D&amp;D flavoured, the dice might be 20-sided, but it’s labelled with simple attack markers on all sides, except for a single critical success (doubling damage) and critical failure (whiffing and potentially damaging allies instead).</p>
<p>The cards you have available to you depend on your character, and here we have a hearty bunch of classic D&amp;D classes and races amongst the defined characters. Bolthrax Brightscale is your forthright Dragonborn Paladin, leading the way with his ability to regenerate armour points and soak up damage, allowing Ash the Tiefling Rogue to sneak and stab, while Jessix the Human Ranger marks her quarry and fires arrows from afar, and Tibby the Halfling Sorcerer can send spells of ice and fire to deal elemental damage. There’s two more characters for the full game, and all of them have specific core abilities that will be available all or most turns, and a menagerie of randomised class abilities that can become available to you down the line –&nbsp;Tibby could get a AOE Fireball, for example, Ash a teleporting stab attack that then shrouds her in stealth, and so on.</p>


<p>There’s a good mixture here, and they work well to compliment one another in battle. It’s an easy game to play, gradually revealing the board as you move through the dungeon, kick open doors, and find surprising hordes of enemy goblins, fungal mycopaths, rogue archers and spell-casters, and just swarms of rats. So many rats.</p>
<p>It can be particularly brutal, as each die bounces around on the 3D board scenery and hands down its judgment, with the traditional slew of good and bad luck that would be enough to see you enshrine or melt down your dice in real world D&amp;D. And the randomised levels can be stuffed to the gills with a bunch of hulking trolls to battle one attempt, and more humble opponents on the next.</p>
<p>So far, so Demeo, but Battlemarked embraces the D&amp;D through what’s wrapped around the core dungeon crawling. There’s more storytelling here, and the first of the demo’s two scenarios has one of those traditional D&amp;D campaign openers, as your band of adventurers happens upon a Neverwinter nobleman in dire straits, as he’s attacked by a band of goblins. This wooded scene with a bridge crossing a stream makes for a nice battleground for a bitesized encounter, leading into an opener for the wider campaign narrative, as you’re then invited to escort the nobleman and a late-coming friend back to a tavern in Neverwinter.</p>

<p>You’re also presented with narrative moments, where you can roll actual D20 for skill checks to, perhaps, deceive or intimidate a Myconid guard, give a dexterity check mid-dungeon to avoid a surprise trap, and more.</p>
<p>There’s plenty that’s locked away for the full game, such as character development options and actually getting to visit taverns to pick up side-quests, so the demo gives just a brief but enticing taster of what’s to come. This is also purely flatscreen, with the full game promising PC VR and PSVR 2 support at launch –&nbsp;which I really rather enjoyed for my VR review of this game.</p>

<p>There’s a few knocks to the feature set of the demo that I really hope aren’t issues for the full game, and they mainly come within the settings menu… or the almost total lack of one. Demeo had tons of options for inverting camera controls, button remapping and more, but none of that is present in Battlemarked’s demo. Additionally, there’s no character outlines for characters that are obscured by the scenery, and that’s more problematic with a gamepad, when the zoom and angle is more rigidly fixed. I also wish it was made more abundantly clear that you’ve retrieved the key needed to use the level exit, and which of your characters has it – the icon is just a bit too small.</p>
<p>All in all, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked might have a trickier title to utter than a typical D&amp;D conjuration, but blending Demeo’s moreish dungeon crawling with the trappings of D&amp;D are simply delightful.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Employees at Electronic Arts (EA) and members of the Communication Workers of America (CWA) have released a statement regarding the pending acquisition and privatization of the company. In the joint statement, union members working at EA state that they weren’t properly represented during sale negotiations and that there is a worry of company layoffs when it happens. </p>



<p>The group says this $55 billion deal will <strong>“further concentrate power and wealth into the hands of a few gatekeepers while doing nothing to address the concerns of players and workers.”</strong></p>



<p><strong>“EA is not a struggling company,”</strong> the statement says. <strong>“With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA’s success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>“Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The group says that if any layoffs take place or if studios close, it’s because of a choice to do so and not something done out of necessity. They say that it would be a move done solely to <strong>“pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the statement, the <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">union has launched a petition</a> for the United States Federal Trade Commission to look more into this deal. They are “calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom.”</p>



<p>The announcement of a deal to sell EA to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in late September</a>. To fund the sale, EA will be taking on $20 billion in debt, which many worry will lead to the aforementioned layoffs.</p>



<p><strong>“Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power,”</strong> they say. <strong>“Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services.”</strong></p>



<p>The statement closes by saying that the <strong>“value of video games is in their workers” </strong>and that they are <strong>“standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry.”</strong></p>

It is one of multiple games in the works, including the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/12/lucasfilm-games-and-quantic-dream-announce-star-wars-eclipse">2021-announced</a> <em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>, which Cage confirmed is ongoing. <span id="more-1000421"></span></p><p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage said. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p><p>Here is the full message from Cage:</p><blockquote><p>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling. With award-winning titles like <em>Heavy Rain</em>, <em>Beyond: Two Souls</em>, and <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, more than 25 million players worldwide have shared the journeys of Ethan Mars, Jodie Holmes, Kara, Markus, and Connor, with us.</p><p>Since 2018, we have entered a new phase of growth and innovation. We doubled the size of the team, bringing together talents from all over the world united by the same passion for creativity. We opened a new studio in Montreal, moved into new headquarters in Paris, built the next generation of our proprietary technology, and became our own publisher.</p><p>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to <a title="Genres > Crafting [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.</p><p>We also know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove—which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique.</p><p>Of course, development of <em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.</p><p>I want to take this opportunity to thank all our fans around the world for playing our games year after year, for their kind words whenever we meet, for their patience and encouragement.</p><p>This is the beginning of a new chapter for Quantic Dream. Thank you for being with us on this journey, we can’t wait to share what comes next.</p><p>—David Cage</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/quantic-dream-developing-multiplayer-title-star-wars-eclipse-development-ongoing]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Quantic Dream is still developing Star Wars: Eclipse, it's assured in a new blog post, alongside development of a new competitive multiplayer game.</p>
<p>The Star Wars game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heavy-rain-developer-quantic-dream-reveals-star-wars-eclipse">first revealed in 2021</a>, but in the years since we've seen little of its development. In October 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quantic-dreams-star-wars-eclipse-development-is-simmering">development was said to be "simmering"</a>, while earlier this year Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-gives-update-amidst-netease-cuts-and-closures">confirmed the studio was not impacted by cuts at NetEase</a> and development continued "at full pace".</p>
<p>Now the studio has shared a <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">new blog post</a> from studio founder David Cage entitled "Writing A New Chapter", in which he provides an update on forthcoming projects.</p>

<p>Since 2018 the company has doubled in size and opened a new studio in Montreal.</p>
<p>"After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step," said Cage. "Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.</p><p>"This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA."</p>
<p>He admitted since the studio has "no legacy in this genre" it has "everything to prove".</p>
<p>Cage then added: "Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future."</p>
<p>It's not much to go on, but it does suggest more concrete news is on the way.</p>
<p>After a couple of releases, Quantic Dream found success with PS3 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a>, which it later replicated with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/beyond-two-souls">Beyond: Two Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-and-quantic-dream-shocked-by-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture">multiple French outlets reported on alleged unhealthy studio culture at Quantic Dream</a>, which was refuted by Fondaumière.</p>
<p>Later, in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/david-cage-defends-response-to-allegations-of-unhealthy-studio-culture-at-quantic-dream-in-new-interview">Cage responded to the allegations</a>. "I don't think we had an aggressive attitude," he said. "When you're accused of things that go against everything you believe in, everything you've done in your life, it hurts. It went beyond just attacking the studio culture."</p>
<p>Lead writer on Star Wars: Eclipse <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-announces-new-studio-working-on-handcrafted-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg">Adam Williams left the studio</a> in 2024 and has since formed a new studio, Republic Games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-passes-away-at-58.1326451/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, best known for creating the&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>franchise and for the revival of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> as a 3D hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;back in 2004, has died aged 58.</p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1978723327435763751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wario64</a> on social media, Itagaki's Facebook account was updated earlier today with a post which (according to Wario64's machine translation) he asked "someone special" to release when the "light of [his] life is about to run out".</p>

<p>Itagaki says that the fact the post has appeared on his Facebook page "means it's finally time" and that he's "no longer in this world". He says he "stand[s] by [his] beliefs" and has "no regrets", except for "not being able to deliver [his] new work", for which he apologizes to his fans.</p>

No cause of death was announced in any of the places where Itagaki's death was confirmed.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki joined the games industry in 1992, where his inaugural project was the Super Famicom port of sports game&nbsp;<em>Tecmo Super Bowl</em>. What would arguably serve as his big break came in 1996, when he headed up&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>for what was then known as Tecmo Creative #3.</p>

<p>That studio would go on to change its name to Team Ninja, working on the rebooted version of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>for the Xbox back in 2004, as well as subsequent 3D hack-and-slash entries in the revived version of the franchise.</p>

<p>Itagaki departed Team Ninja in 2008 and would go on to work on just two games following his departure, namely 2015's much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Devil's Third&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Samurai Jack: Battle through Time</em>, albeit as an advisor on the second title.</p>

The post said he had no regrets and stood by his beliefs, but apologized to his fans for not being able to produce more games.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Words I Leave Behind</span></p> <p><span>The flame of my life is finally about to go out.</span></p> <p><span>If this message has been posted, it means that the time has come.

But you… isn’t it a bit too soon? Didn’t you say you were going to defeat me someday? Didn’t you come to my wedding, wearing your usual black leather jacket and sunglasses, and call me your comrade-in-arms? Didn’t you tell me to come to you whenever I was in trouble?

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>Team Ninja has just announced that their first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki, has unfortunately passed away. </p>



<p>All eyes are on Team Ninja right now, as their highly anticipated installment to the Ninja Gaiden franchise arrives on October 21, 2025. We have already seen a lot of the game through several trailers and teasers, and it seems that it’s going to be a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult one</a>. However, less than a week before release, one of the most integral people behind the franchise’s revival has passed away. </p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki’s passing was announced through Team Ninja’s <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post stated: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA’s first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki. </p>



<p>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. </p>



<p>Our deepest condolences for his loss. </p>



<p>From everyone at Team NINJA</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For those unaware, Tomonobu Itagaki is a renowned Japanese video game designer who started his journey at Tecmo in 1992. Itagaki’s claim to success came with 1996’s Dead or Alive. In 2001, Itagaki was named Team Ninja’s first leader, where he revived the 1988 arcade franchise Ninja Gaiden and released it for Xbox in 2004. The title received widespread critical acclaim and an international online tournament. </p>



<p>Following that, the Team Ninja leader helped release Ninja Gaiden Black, Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword, and Ninja Gaiden II. He then left Tecmo in 2008 due to a fallout and founded Vallhalla Game Studios, where he helped develop Devil’s Third with some former Team Ninja members. Then, in 2021, Itagaki created another studio, called Itagaki Games. </p>

<p>While Battlefield 6 has a fun and varied arsenal, nothing beats the best assault rifle, and our top meta loadout ensures the weapon has you locked in and will get you more kills than if you used any other AR.</p>



<p>An assault rifle is a staple of online FPS shooters. Sniper Rifles aren’t always applicable, Shotguns also depend on the size of the map, LMGs are powerful but as mobile as a tank, and SMGs also fall into that ‘circumstantial’ territory. An assault rifle is an all-around beast, and even the bad ones are good.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has a reliable foundation of assault rifles to kickstart the game, so let’s see which AR is considered to be the meta selection, and we’ll take a deep dive into its best loadout and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-in-battlefield-6">What Is The Best Assault Rifle In Battlefield 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Test it out if you’re unsure. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The consensus is that the M433 is the best meta assault rifle in Battlefield 6, which is no surprise as it’s an extremely effective weapon at most ranges.</strong></p>



<p>Whether you used it in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a>‘s campaign or online, the M433 is a monstrous weapon. Everything about it works: Firepower, fire rate, recoil control, its default ammo clip size, mobility, and handling. It’s literally the perfect assault rifle, and it only gets better once you start applying the best attachments to it.</p>







<p>Our best M433 assault rifle class focuses on reducing recoil and making it more efficient and effective during combat. It’s not the most attachments you can have for the gun—so feel free to tinker and add more—but this is a simple and relatively easy to put together loadout.</p>



<p>Here’s our best M433 assault rifle meta loadout.</p>

<figure><figcaption>From the get-go. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You’ll be pleased to know that the M433 assault rifle is unlocked by default at the beginning of your Battlefield 6 online multiplayer journey!</strong></p>



<p>It wouldn’t be convenient if all weapons were locked when you start playing Battlefield 6 online, would it? Some guns need to be available, and the M433 is one of them. This means you can equip it right away and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-farm-xp-level-up-fast-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start leveling it up fast and earning XP</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-assault-rifle-class-setup-in-battlefield-6">Best Assault Rifle Class Setup In Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Alongside your M433 assault rifle, you also need the right equipment and abilities. From Frontliner to the M87A1 Shotgun, we’ve picked out the gear you need to complement the M433 perfectly.</p>



<p>Check out each slot and what to put in it:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Field Specs:</strong> Frontliner</li>



<li><strong>Sidearm:</strong> P18 (Pistol)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 1:</strong> M87A1 (Shotgun)</li>



<li><strong>Gadget 2:</strong> Deploy Beacon</li>



<li><strong>Throwable:</strong> Fragmentation Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Melee:</strong> Sledgehammer</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Frontliner </strong>is preferable from Field Specs (once you unlock it) as it speeds up health recovery, reduces fall damage, and gives a brief buff to spawning teammates. It’s just a generally great set of abilities that aim to keep you alive for longer and make you stronger.</p>



<p>The <strong>P18 </strong>is the best and most consistent Pistol in Battlefield 6, so that’s an easy one. We’ve opted for the M87A1 shotgun as the first gadget, as that’s the best shotgun in the game. It’s unstoppable, and the perfect option for close-range combat. Whereas the <strong>Deploy Beacon</strong> gets you—and your squad—back into the fray faster.</p>



<p>The <strong>Fragmentation Grenade</strong> is a standard Frag Grenade that’s great for puncturing holes in the walls and enemies, and speaking of both of those things, the <strong>Sledgehammer </strong>is a beastly, bludgeoning no-brainer.</p>

            <p>EA employees and the Communications Workers of America union have issued a statement against the proposed private acquisition of the company, claiming they were not represented in the negotiations and any jobs lost as a result would "be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">acquisition of EA by a group of private investors</a> was announced at the end of September. The deal, for $55bn, includes investment from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Affinity Partners, the company of President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, there's been plenty of speculation around the future of EA and its multiple owned studios, split between EA Sports and EA Entertainment. Now, members of the United Videogame Workers union and the CWA have <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">issued a formal response</a> alongside a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">petition for regulators to scrutinise the deal</a>.</p>
<p>"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world."</p>
<p>This success has been driven by company workers, the union stated. "Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardised as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed."</p>
<p>Citing the number of layoffs across the industry since 2022, workers fear for "the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p>
<p>"If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets - not to strengthen the company," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," it continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinise this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."</p>
<p>As such, workers have launched a petition in a "fight to make video games better for workers and players - not billionaires".</p>
<p>The statement concludes: "The value of video games is in their workers. As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry."</p>
<p>Eurogamer contacted the Federal Trade Commission following news of the proposed acquisition of EA, but it refused to comment "on pending mergers or acquisitions".</p>
<p>A report from The Financial Times suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-private-acquisition-deal-expected-to-go-smoothly-says-report-as-what-regulator-is-going-to-say-no-to-the-presidents-son-in-law">deal won't face much opposition</a>. As one source said: "What regulator is going to say no to the president's son-in-law?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">spoke with the Human Rights Watch on the controversial acquisition</a>. "We have found that the public investment fund has contributed to, and is responsible for, human rights abuses," said researcher Joey Shea on the involvement of Saudi Arabia's government. "This is a trillion dollars in Saudi state wealth that should be invested to realise the economic and social rights of Saudi citizens. We've found it's been invested in vanity mega projects inside and outside of the country.</p><p>"We see this as a deliberate attempt to distract from the country's human rights abuses [...] MBS himself wields enormous power over what is effectively public funds, and he wields this power in a highly arbitrary and personalised manner, rather than the benefit of the Saudi people more broadly. Effectively, Saudi Arabia's vast fossil fuel-derived state wealth is controlled by one person, which isn't good for human rights, or business either."</p>

            <p>
It's still a little hard to believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> is a thing that exists and is finally here - but here it most definitely is, and developer Team Cherry continues to finesse the experience, with its fourth patch now officially in public beta.
</p>
<p>
Chief among Patch 4's additions is what Team Cherry is calling a "basic implementation" of Silksong's new Simplified Chinese translation - the first step in its efforts to remedy the original translation, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-being-review-bombed-in-china">heavily criticised in a wave of negative Steam reviews</a> back in September.
</p>
<p>
That arrives alongside localisation improvements across a range of languages, further improvements to controller support, and various fixes for a number of highly specific scenarios. Which is to say, you're out of luck if you were hoping Team Cherry might finally look upon you - and your struggles against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-picking-it-up-a-lot-faster-hollow-knight-newcomers-and-veterans-respond-to-the-first-few-hours-of-silksong">Silksong's sometimes punishing difficulty</a> - with benevolent eyes.

<p>
Silksong's public beta patch is available on Steam by selecting Properties &gt; Betas, then opting into the public-beta branch under Beta Participation. Patch notes are below, but Team Cherry says development remains "very much in progress", so expect more fixes ahead of its final release to all players:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation with a new script for public testing. This is a basic implementation only, to be refined and updated based on player feedback.</li>
<li>Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.</li>
<li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognised. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please visit: https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html </li>
<li>Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.</li>
<li>Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.</li>
<li>Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.</li>
<li>Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).</li>
<li>Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.</li>
<li>Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.</li>
<li>Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.</li>
<li>Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In addition to Silksong's upcoming fourth patch, Version 1.0.28891 received its full release earlier this week, primarily bringing improved controller support. PlayStation's DualSense Edge controllers are now compatible with Silksong, for instance, and Mac users can expect better compatibility across a range of controllers too. Additionally, the game now automatically pauses if your controller disconnects, meaning you're less likely to spiral into a pit of enraged despair if your batteries suddenly run out in the middle of a boss fight.
</p>
<p>
Full Version 1.0.28891 patch notes for Silksong - which Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">awarded five gleaming stars in our review</a> earlier this year - can be found below:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for Dualsense Edge controllers.</li>
<li>Improved support for various controllers on Mac.</li>
<li>Game now pauses when the controller disconnects.</li>
<li>Fixed various smaller controller issues (more fixes to come in future).</li>
<li>Fixed remaining instance of certain players getting stuck cursed while in the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw not reacting to Hunter down-stab.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of being able to air dash and double jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed several out of bounds situations.</li>
<li>Fixed Pharlid Divers sometimes sliding on roofs after ambushing in certain scenes.</li>
<li>Fixed Eva Hunter Crest upgrades unintentionally clearing tool equips.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instances of Harpoon sometimes granting 2 Silk instead of 1.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies sometimes appearing from odd locations after scene transition and, in rare cases, having their active quantity reduced by 1.</li>

<li>Slight increase to Sharp Dart and Cross Stitch damage.</li>

<li>Fixed Crust King Khann sometimes falling out of bounds during entry, when fought on low-end systems.</li>
<li>Fixed rare instance of Second Sentinel becoming rotated when defeated.</li>
<li>Fixed additional case of Seth sometimes getting out of bounds and not returning.</li>
<li>Fixed Seth sometimes remaining invincible for a moment at the start of a refight.</li>
<li>Fixed Vaults slide blocks incorrectly responding to damage sources other than the needle.</li>
<li>Changed Fine Pins wish drops from 50% chance to 100%, but raised required quantity.</li>
<li>Fixed issues when consuming a Silkeater while in water.</li>
<li>Fixed Scuttlebrace sometimes allowing a wall jump when not intended.</li>
<li>Fixed a soft-lock during the Grand Gate opening sequence, if the Citadel had been visited and some bellshrines remained inactive.</li>
<li>Various smaller fixes and tweaks.</li>
</ul>
