            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount Pictures has released the first&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>movie trailer, and just as we suspected, none other than Keanu Reeves himself has indeed been cast as antagonist Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p>The trailer begins with James Marsden's Tom telling Sonic he's finally found his family, before we cut to the emergence of Shadow the Hedgehog from a testing facility. Team Sonic - that is, Sonic, Tails, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knuckles-series-release-date">Knuckles</a> - are enlisted to help defeat him.</p>
<p>It looks like the story is playing up the parallel between Sonic and Shadow; a voiceover tells us that Shadow's story began in much the same way as Sonic's, but where Sonic found friends and family, Shadow found "only pain and loss".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-maria.jpg?itok=yNS_LcdY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-shadow-maria.jpg?itok=0LlrZ8uE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>takes inspiration from&nbsp;<em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but it won't feature the same exact storyline.</figcaption></figure><p>We only hear two spoken lines from Shadow. In his first, he describes Sonic and friends as a "colorful bunch", and in the second, he tells Sonic he did "what [he] had to", although naturally, the context for that exchange isn't clear yet.</p>
<p>Still, as if one of the trailer's hashtags didn't already make it explicit, the two lines are enough to make it abundantly clear that it's Keanu Reeves voicing the hedgehog.</p>
<p>As the trailer progresses, Sonic and his friends attempt to fight Shadow, but are obviously outmatched. They're forced to seek the help of none other than Jim Carrey's Dr. Robotnik, who's likely cooking up a plan of his own.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer here, which features some fun audio callbacks based on&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>'s "Green Hill Zone" and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-teaser"><em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>'s "Live and Learn"</a>, right here.</p>

<p>During the closing moments of the trailer, we also see Robotnik coming face to face with a figure who is presumably his grandfather Gerald, although we don't get to hear his name.</p>
<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3&nbsp;</em>hits movie theaters on December 20th. We'll likely learn more about its narrative and cast in the intervening months, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Oh, <em>hell </em>yes! The first trailer for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/9/23297992/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-live-action-movie-december-2024-release-date"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a> is out, giving fans a first listen of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131385/keanu-reeves-shadow-the-hedgehog-sonic-3">Keanu Reeves as Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.</p></div><p>Reeves doesn’t put too much spin on his interpretation of Shadow, sounding very much like himself. But considering fans were hype as hell that he was doing Shadow’s voice, I think Keanu doing his best Keanu will go over fine with audiences. The trailer sets up Shadow the Hedgehog as the toughest enemy Team Sonic has ever had to face, requiring them to call in outside help. Jim Carrey returns as Dr. Robotnik, who has apparently let himself go. For <em>Sonic 3</em>, they’re not wasting a drop of Carrey’s comedic talent, having him play not one Robotnik but two. </p><p>Shadow’s arrival was teased at the end of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23014568/sonic-the-hedgehog-2-review-movie-jim-carrey"><em>Sonic 2</em></a>. Although we didn’t get to hear him then, various outlets later reported that Reeves had been cast as the black-furred, gun-toting hedgehog with an attitude problem. Yesterday, Paramount began teasing the trailer’s imminent arrival by projecting images of Sonic, Shadow, and perennial baddie Dr. Robotnik <a href="https://twitter.com/DorianParksnRec/status/1827935480648020008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1827935480648020008%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">on buildings all over the world</a>.</p><p>Judging from the trailer’s sad narration of Shadow’s life of pain and suffering, <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> is definitely taking its broader plot points from <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em> — the 2001 game in which Shadow made his first appearance. We also got a glimpse of Maria, the girl Shadow befriends during his time as a lab hedgehog, and it’ll be interesting to see how the movie treats her fate. </p><p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em> chaos controls into theaters on December 20th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A new trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> has been released, giving us a proper look at Shadow the Hedgehog and a chance to hear his voice for the first time. You can check out the trailer below.
</p>
<p>
Shadow's voice actor, confirms <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-shadow-keanu-reeves-1235852090/">Variety</a>, is Keanu Reeves (The Matrix, John Wick), as heavily rumoured.
</p>
<p>
Back in April, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-reportedly-casts-keanu-reeves-as-shadow">rumoured Reeves would be voicing Shadow</a>. And the end of the second Sonic film heavily hinted at Shadow's inclusion.

<p>
So what else was shown in the trailer?
</p>
<p>
As expected, Shadow will be the main nemesis wrecking havoc Sonic, Tails and Knuckles will have to join forces to beat.
</p>
<p>
It includes the return of Jim Carey as Dr. Robotnik - and another intriguing character too. There's no sign yet of who Krysten Ritter will be playing.
</p>
<p>
I'll admit I was hoping for some more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a> references, though the night-time metropolis setting of much of the trailer could at least be a nod to Radical Highway. I need the truck chase! There's even an Akira motorcycle slide, of course.

<p>
The music, too, reorchestrates both the classic Green Hill Zone and Sonic Adventure 2's theme Live &amp; Learn.
</p>
<p>

Did you spot anything? Let us know in the comments.
</p>
<p>
The release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 on 20th December will round off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Sega's Year of Shadow</a>, which also includes Lego sets, a tour of the Shadow motorcycle, and the release in October of Sonic x Shadow Generations.

</p>
<p>
I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with that game's Shadow campaign</a> a couple of months ago and enjoyed its big dash of nostalgia.

			<p>What do you get when intelligent toys turn on their creators? Humanity’s extinction. That’s the scenario you’re thrust into when Gori: Cuddly Carnage starts off. It’s been a little while since all the humans were killed by AI-powered intelligent toys, but not all the toys became bad. Gori, a bipedal cat, along with allies FRANK the potty mouth hoverboard, and CHIP, a rather depressed AI, set out to destroy the evil toys in as efficiently chaotic way as possible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gori: Cuddly Carnage - Meow Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA61jRAZlK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s narrative is decently written but a pretty by-the-numbers plot. However, the comedy is on point. Yes, it’s juvenile and reliant on lots of swears, but the delivery is great, with the factory mission and the manager standing out as a fun comedy highlight. The delivery of lines just sounds like the team is having a fun time with the script. It is silly but it will make you laugh. It’s worth mentioning that finishing all the levels will get you one ending, but to get the proper ending you do need to find all the key pieces and rescue every single unicorn.</p>


<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is an action game which is split into eight main levels plus 14 challenge missions. Each main mission gives you a star ranking based on how long it takes to beat it, the top combo you can put together, the total score, and the difficulty level. Challenge missions also have a three-star rating, though the measuring stick for these varies from combo scores to time remaining on the clock. Gori: Cuddly Carnage’s difficulty ranges from Indoor Cat, aka easy, all the way up to Cuddly Carnage, the ultimate difficulty.</p>
<p>I played through the levels twice, first on House Cat (Normal) and then Cuddly Carnage to gauge the difficulty jump. Aside from enemies dealing more damage and bosses having a couple more attacks, I didn’t really notice a huge step up in challenge. However, that’s more than likely down to the fact I had unlocked the majority of upgrades giving Gori more health, stronger attacks, and more fuel to move faster and perform special attacks for my second run.</p>


<p>FRANK is more than just a hoverboard. FRANK is Gori’s weapon, equipped with blades and a whacking attack, with both used in motion as the pair speed around environments. Gori also gets a grenade launcher to hit big groups from range. In each mission you’ll move between arenas filled with enemies before coming up against mini bosses and final bosses. The enemies start off as basic unicorns but evolutions of the mythical horned horse are gradually introduced as you move through the game. There’s a decent variety of enemy types from blade-wielding melee attackers to flying bomb-droppers, and larger ones that can perform high powered attacks. Yet, even with this range&nbsp;of enemy, combat boils down to a handful of attacks.</p>
<p>That said, combat itself is enjoyable and rewarding as you pull off combos using the different attacks, and while there’s an extensive move list there is generally enough fuel to use the special slash and whacking attacks near-constantly. While it is satisfying to wipe out masses of enemies using these moves, it can get a bit repetitive and going back to normal moves feel slow in comparison. Enemies can be relentless, swarming towards Gori with lethal intent so the thankfully-slick movement is paramount to survival. There are occasionally issues with judging distances between jumps in platforming sections, and some combat areas can work against the power moves due to there being so many places to fall off the edges.</p>
<p>Gori: Cuddly Carnage is full of bold and bright colours, and some of the level designs are packed with excellent ideas. The arcade level in particular, as you jump into different machines, is a great imaginative experiment. Enemy designs are fun too and you can tell the designers have thought of lots of different ways to turn childhood toys into nightmarish creatures. The bosses are also well-designed, but suffer from having very obvious weak points highlighted.</p>

<p>While Gori: Cuddly Carnage is a fun game there are a couple of downsides. The camera can be finicky at times which isn’t helpful when the action is so fast-paced. There’s also a lock on for enemies so the camera follows them, but it is hit and miss with the angles it chooses to use. During my playthrough the game did also crash a couple of times back to the PS5 homescreen, though this can hopefully be ironed out in an early patch.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Gori Cuddly Carnage is a really fun game that offers a decent mix in its levels and challenges. I did play through levels a couple of times because I enjoyed the gameplay and the humour of it. While there are some issues, namely the camera and a couple of platforming bits, overall Gori Cuddly Carnage is a fun, gory, time.	</p></div>

			<p>While The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria has been out on the Epic Games Store for a while, those who prefer to use Steam or play on Xbox Series X|S will finally be able to have their own dwarven adventure. This is the only survival crafting game that is set in the Fourth Age of Middle-earth, a rich expansive universe full of different stories to be told. If you want to get your hands on The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria on either <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or Xbox Series X|S, it is currently available for a discounted price of $19.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria™ Steam and Xbox Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cnt7N3H49IE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Previously, the developers of this game were working on an update for the Beta and Epic Games Store version which would allow crossplay. As the game has just released on new platforms, that update will automatically be available to those who are just getting stuck in now. All platforms will be able to take part in crossplay, meaning you can play with friends who are on PlayStation 5 even if you're on PC or Xbox.</p>
<p>This update is named "<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-is-out-october-24-for-pc-ps5-features-john-rhys-davies-as-gimli/">The Golden Update</a>" and includes a myriad of new features as well as crossplay. This includes a Sandbox mode, for those who prefer to play without a challenge present. For those on Steam, there is also the option to purchase an exclusive bundle, which will include the game, the official soundtrack comprised of 34 unique tracks, as well as an art exhibition, which is also discounted for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Golden Update was previously only available on the Epic Games Store but is now widely available across all platforms. It allows Steam and Epic Games users to host 8-player gaming sessions in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, regardless of what platform the other players are joining from.</p>
<p>In addition to crossplay, there are now over 100 new decorations for players to choose from to customize their base how they like, to make it look as earthy or cozy as they like. One of the main features added that will benefit people who play the game solo is now the option to pause the game. To be able to pause the game, you just need to hit Escape or open the settings menu, and you'll be able to return to the game without fear of consequences.</p>
<p>New difficulty settings also allow players to fine-tune the experience to their liking, such as changing the aggressiveness of enemies, combat, and the frequency of drops.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Drow have a tumultuous history in fantasy TTRPGs. They are a staple of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, a group of subterranean elves characterized by ruthless ambition, cruelty, and sharp cunning. They have been the source of controversy given their potentially problematic design and coding, as well as the source of iconic heroes like Drizzt Do'urden. Now, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/steamforged-games-local-legends-ttrpgs-and-adaptation" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steamforged Games</a> has their own take on these long-lived warriors in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>.</p>

<p>In <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em>, your adventuring party attempts infiltrate the underground city of the drow. This is done by the group sneaking into the city by boat. As for whether or not the party fights or talks their way through customs is for the dice to decide. From there, it escalates into storming the titular palace.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=DyS7OhYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounters-palace-of-the-drow-queen-miniatures-screenshot.jpg?itok=F99aWpAL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It ain't Menzoberranzan, but it's still lethal.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the drow or more than prepared for any opposition. The enemies contained within the box are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>4x Drow Warriors</li>
<li>4x Drow Crossbowmen</li>
<li>2x Lizard Cavalry</li>
<li>2x Drow Whirlwind</li>
<li>3x Oneiromancer</li>
<li>1x Drow Queen</li>
</ul><p>In broad strokes, <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is an enclosed, uphill battle. The party starts the first map on a boat surrounded by guards, are bottlenecked by a gate, and are overwhelmed by lizard-riding cavalry at the docks. The second map, continues this push into the palace with traps and strategically placed units. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bandit Camp</a> encounter, the Drow intelligently leverages a homefield advantage against the players at every turn; making every inch of progress feel earned.</p>
<p>This is also the first <em>Epic Encounters</em> box I have used where the different Drow statblocks have scaling rules. Every <em>Epic Encounters</em> box has different difficulty numbers and damage dice based on your group's play tier. Level 1-4 characters have environmental hazards that deal damage in D4s, and Level 10+ characters get hit with d10s from their surroundings. The enemy scaling does something similar, adjusting ACs, attacks per turn, available spells, and health.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=z_7iBUr8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-encounter-palace-of-the-drow-queen-palace-battlemap.jpg?itok=VbMgZVUu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Oneiromancer doesn't attack, it just makes it hard for you to hit anything else.</figcaption></figure><p>This is great since the enemy placement in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is very deliberate. The module as written is light on monster closets or incoming waves of enemies. This is good because each Drow enemy poses a challenge in their own right.</p>
<p>Steamforged Games manages to put their spin on the Drow in this box. In addition to the more familiar trappings: matriarchal society, gothic architecture, lizard mounts, etc., they have traits connecting them to spiders and drider monsters. It isn't completely gratuitous body horror, but it does give the Drow more distinct physical characteristics. There's even a unique bit of culture with mind and memory magic with their oneiromancers. It all blends into this wonderfully macabre take on the underground elves.</p>
<h2>What is in Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider?</h2>
<p>Rounding out <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> is the boss box, <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em>. Like other box boxes in this line, you get one gigantic drider miniature, a double-sided battlemap, and some minion tokens.</p>
<p>As an extension of the mental magic and low-key body horror elements in the first box, <em>Lair of the Drider</em> is a daunting boss encounter. Its different lair abilities and spells are a potent combination of area control and debuff. Faerie Fire, Dancing Lights, Cone of Cold, Web, all and more are present.</p>

Also adventurers that want to live.</figcaption></figure><p>The arena itself is even more brutal, There are known hazards such as getting caught in webbing, as well as dangerous tactical hazards like crystals that gush poisonous gas and geographically confusing tunnel passages. For especially sadistic DMs, there are even cracks in reality that form during the fight. If a character fails their save against that, it is an instakill.</p>
<p>What keeps <em>Epic Encounters: Lair of the Drider</em> from turning into a tedious slog of overlapping inconvenience is the nature of the drider boss. The booklet expressly states, as a result of its creation involving mental magic and body grafing, the Drider can't commit to a single idea or plan. This scatterbrained mentality is not just a great worldbuilding detail, it is something the players can use to their advantage.</p>
<p>My one critique of the encounter plagues all official <em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition</em> adventures. While the Drider can cover the area in darkness, webbing, teleport, and mess with the environment, it is only on one axis of terrain. If you're a DM that allows aarokocra or owlin PCs in an adventure, they may trivialize this boss encounter through air superiority.</p>

<p>Overall, I love Steamforged Games' grotesque and esoteric take on drow in <em>Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen</em> and <em>Lair of the Drider</em>. The encounters in the former are brilliantly crafted with solidly scaled threats and the latter is a nail-biting exercise in resource and mobility management. If you want to spice up an underground encounter, you can't go wrong with either of these boxes.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
Epic Encounters: Palace of the Drow Queen and Lair of the Drider is a great, grotesque, and mesmerizing interpretation of the drow. Well worth a look for fans of underground fighters. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

The dwarven engineers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord Of The Rings: Return To Moria</a> have formally entered the Golden Age of Steam. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933130/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Return_to_Moria/">now available on Valve's digital storefront</a>, after a year in the comparatively barren underdark of the Epic Games Store, and developers Free Range Games have also released a Golden Update, which adds offline single player pausing, around 100 building objects, and a sandbox mode allowing for non-story-led excavation and settlement of the game's procedurally generated mountains. Plus, new hats and axes! Try not to get dragon sickness.

I haven't played Return To Moria since October last year. Back then, it was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-review">comfortingly vast survival game</a> with crunchy torch-lit aesthetics, many gorgeous biomes to uncover, and a fair amount of jank. (For the purposes of Immersion, please find on the right an image with a translation of "jank" into Khuzdûl, the ancient runic language of the Dwarves, care of <a href="https://tengwartranscriber.github.io/">Tengwar Transcriber</a>.)</p>
<p>I'm definitely up for another crack at this particular seam of lore-digging, as long as they've fixed that thing where all your interior decorations end up at tortuous 45 degree angles to the layout. Here's an 11-minute talkthrough video from game director, detailing both what's in the Golden Update and what they've added since launching on EGS.

<p>
If you don't have time for a video, here's my own breakdown of the Golden Update. Let's start with the sandbox mode, which has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-morias-next-major-update-adds-a-sandbox-mode-and-single-player-pause">available in beta on EGS</a>. This lets you generate worlds from "a wide variety of random seeds, meaning each playthrough can vary significantly in layout and difficulty". There are "minimal tutorials" in sandbox, and as such, the devs recommend that you only play if you're familiar with the game's campaign or with other survival sims. Sandbox brings with it crafting recipes for 14 new kinds of weapon and armour. These include the Wolf Skin Hat and the Barôkamlut, or mithril battleaxe. You will probably find the Barôkamlut useful when seeking to acquire the materials for Wolf Skin Hats.
</p>
<p>
The update also adds crossplay functionality, allowing the proud longbeards of PC to mingle with the upstart stonelords of PS5 and Xbox in sessions of up to eight players. If you'd rather excavate Khazad-dûm on your lonesome, you can now pause the game by hitting escape while playing offline. 
</p>
<p>
As for the new building objects, these range from rugs and banners to light fixtures, tavern signs and chairs. The improvements to the building system itself are probably of greater interest to players re-Returning to Moria. "Restoring Moria is now easier than ever with the changes made to the stability system as well as improved object snapping," explains the press release. "The pre-placed buildings throughout Moria are now stronger than ever, expanding players' ability to build expansive bases wherever they choose."
</p>
<p>
They've also expanded the game's difficulty settings, with options for enemy aggression, the frequency of hordes, sieges or patrols, and the abundance of mining drops. Add in the promise of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2933130/view/4241914673865774571?l=english">Steam Deck compatibility</a>, together with new ambient music, and you have a game I'll try to carve out some fresh hours for this weekend. It's no <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dwarf-fortress-steam-review">Dwarf Fortress</a>, but it's got charm.

The team remarks that he’s the most powerful foe they’ve ever faced, and we see him absolutely pulverize the trio.

It jumps off the second film’s post-credits cliffhanger, which shows Shadow waking up in a secret facility, having been kept in cryostasis for over 50 years. That’s par for the course for the character and matches his backstory from his debut in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a 1:1 adaptation of the Dreamcast game, but is clearly borrowing some elements from it. Alyla Browne (who played the young Furiosa in the early stretch of this year’s <em>Fury Road </em>prequel) plays Maria Robotnik, a key figure in Shadow’s origin and a major character in the events of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, so it’s clear the movie is drawing heavy inspiration from the 2001 platformer.</p><p>Reeves and Browne are making their series debuts with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>, but returning cast members include Ben Schwartz as the titular speedy hedgehog, Colleen O’Shaughnessey reprising her role as Tails both from the previous two movies and the video games, and Idris Elba as Knuckles.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating.964491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-esrb-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the official <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39971/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB site</a>, Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition now has a Teen rating for PlayStation 5 and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>The ratings summary does mostly break down gameplay basics. But it also mentions “behind-the-scenes content” and a “handful of art-gallery images, since they include some “suggestive” material. This hints that the anniversary edition could include quite a few special features.</p>



<p>This week, Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition also got fresh ratings in Taiwan for current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as the Switch.</p>



<p>So, although there’s no concrete release date just yet, there may be an official announcement coming sometime soon. Earlier this week, original developer Team17 also shared a Gamescom 2024 video, acknowledging that Worms Armageddon is “still thriving 25 years later.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The original Worms Armageddon first launched in the 90’s, eventually releasing on platforms like the Dreamcast, Game Boy Color, and Nintendo 64. </p>



<p>Worms Armageddon remains a beloved staple of the series, as well as the industry itself, praised for its creative and cartoonish turn-based action. </p>



<p>The most recent games in the series include Worms W.M.D from 2016 and Worms Rumble in 2020. </p>



<p>The former launched to decent reviews, and still has a 7.5 from critics and users alike on Metacritic. However, Worms Rumble received very mixed reviews. </p>



<p>So, fans may be pleased to revisit Worms Armageddon soon after its ESRB rating. Since its rating applies to the Switch, an official announcement might arrive during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-indie-world-direct-partner-showcase-coming-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo’s upcoming showcases</a> today.</p>

<p>The first full trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog 3 has been released ahead of its release later this year.</p>



<p>The new trailer, which you can watch below, gives everyone an overview of the movie’s premise. It also shows the first look at the debuting Shadow the Hedgehog, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/keanu-reeves-to-voice-shadow-in-sonic-3-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">voiced by Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, Shadow is the main nemesis in the upcoming movie. It even gets to the point where Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles go to Dr. Robotnik, played once again by Jim Carrey, for help. We also see the debut of Carrey as Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather.</p>



<p>What we don’t see in the trailer is whether or not Dr. Robotnik and Shadow ultimately team up at any point in the film. In the various games, they have worked side by side.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 releases in theaters on December 20.</p>

            <p>Alien: Romulus and The Last of Us Part 2 have a bit of an unexpected connection.</p>
<p>Alien: Romulus - the latest film in the Alien franchise - recently released, and stars Isabela Merced in a leading role. While Merced has acted in many films and series, those on this site may recognise her name as that of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/isabela-merced-cast-as-dina-in-hbos-the-last-of-us-adaptation">Dina in the upcoming second season of The Last of Us</a>. But, that's not where the connection ends.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Alien: Romulus director Fede Álvarez revealed the film's character of Kay (played by Merced) was actually inspired in part by Dina from The Last of Us Part 2. This was before Merced was cast in either role. What are the chances - Dina see that coming, and all that. <strong>Please be aware of a small The Last of Us Part 2 spoiler below. </strong></p>

</figure>
<p>"Fun fact: I was playing [The Last of Us Part 2] while writing [Alien: Romulus]," Álvarez shared on social media platform X over the weekend. "The story of a pregnant Dina made me think of having the character of Kay be pregnant too. Then I cast Isabela Merced to play Kay."</p>
<p>The director went on to state that a year later, he found out that Merced had also been cast as Dina in HBO's adaptation of the game, completing an unexpected and rather serendipitous circle.</p>
<p>"True story," Álvarez closed (I am assuming a pregnant pause followed).</p> <div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-1-0-update-out-now-full-patch-notes-revealed.964452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have released the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 update, as well as bringing the game to consoles for the first time. Naturally, the update's full patch notes are now also available.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4335363098084315163" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a> celebrating the update's release, Pugstorm and Fireshine say&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "main story arc is now complete", and that anyone who's had the game on their wishlist while waiting for it to exit Early Access should "start [their] adventure" now.</p>
<p>The two studios also run down <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-new-biome-more">some of the new content</a> that's arrived as part of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s full release, including changes to the Core, a "new and improved world-generation system", and new PvP play, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-update-patch-notes-cave.jpeg?itok=TaeXv7oq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-1.0-update-patch-notes-cave.jpeg?itok=ku2pv7Oa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new treats to enjoy in its 1.0 update.</figcaption></figure><p>Fireshine and Pugstorm also say that if you have old worlds from before the 1.0 launch, you'll still be able to play them; they're now marked as "Classic" worlds. However, the studios "strongly recommend" starting new worlds, since only by starting afresh can you experience a lot of new 1.0 content.</p>
<p>Of course, the full patch notes for the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0 release have also been revealed, and just as you'd expect, they get deep into the nitty-gritty of exactly what's new. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1621690/view/4247544173389770568" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check those patch notes out here</a> if you want to see all of the new content.</p>
<p>The patch notes include details of how the new world generation system works, as well as info about new bosses, combat styles, and areas. It's well worth reading them if you're planning to delve into&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>1.0, but be aware the full notes are fairly long.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is, it's an indie sandbox survival game in which you (and, optionally, your friends) must build a life for yourself while exploring a series of underground biomes.</p>
<p>As you unravel the mystery of the titular Core, you'll gather resources, build a base, and upgrade your tools until you're ready to take down every monster that looks at you funny.</p>
<p><em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009534" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/core-keeper-xbox-series-xs/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. A version for PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch is also in the works, although it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-delayed-last-gen">not coming until September</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Visions of Mana Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/visions-of-mana-review.964446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/visions-of-mana-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It would be an understatement to say that Visions of Mana has high expectations to live up to. There hasn’t been a main entry in the Mana series in nearly 20 years, with only spin-offs and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/trials-of-mana-review">3D remakes</a> of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legend-of-mana-review">older games</a> tiding fans over in the meantime. But thankfully, the wait was worth it. Although there are a few glaring flaws, Visions of Mana successfully brings the series into the modern age with excellent combat and class systems, as well as a new cast of likable characters. It's not only a great Mana game, but it’s become one of my personal favorite JRPGs in years.</p><p>If I could sum up my impressions of Visions of Mana’s storytelling in its opening acts with one word, it would be “simple” – and I mean that as a compliment. I’m a big fan of games tackling complex subjects or having dense lore to comb through, but not everything needs to be complicated just for the sake of it. Visions of Mana keeps its plot straightforward instead of bogging it down with needless exposition — at first, at least.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Visions of Mana Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You play as Val, a skilled swordsman who must escort a group of people chosen to sacrifice their souls to sustain the Tree of Mana. This includes Hinna, Val’s childhood friend and hinted sweetheart, and I found the duo endearing right from the start. You’d normally expect a character in Val’s role as a guardian to be someone who takes things too seriously, but instead he’s cheerful, charming, and brimming with optimism. And rather than dwell on being compelled to sacrifice herself, Hinna is honored to be selected and excited to make her pilgrimage with Val by her side.</p><p>The party members they gain along the way have their own distinctive personalities that add variety. Careena, for example, is plucky yet irritable, and — for some baffling reason I’m still trying to wrap my head around — speaks with a heavy Texan accent. Morely, meanwhile, is easily the most serious of the group, but it's his blunt attitude that leads to some of the funniest moments. It soon becomes apparent what shaped your new friends into the people they are, and each has a proper arc that gives them a chance to grow as individuals by directly confronting their own flaws. Rather than feeling like side stories, their tales are woven into the central plot in a way that feels organic. Gaining more insight into these characters helped change my entire perspective of them — for instance, Careena begins the journey as a brat and I had initially dismissed her as rude, but by the end, I found her to be one of the most endearing party members.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main story had me intrigued from the very beginning.</p></div><p>Visions of Mana’s main story itself had me intrigued from the very beginning, but while I loved the brisk pace of the first half, it slows to an absolute crawl later on. To avoid spoilers, I’m not able to go into detail about what my biggest gripes are, but there’s a large chunk of the final 15 to 20 hours (I rolled credits on the campaign in just under 40) that I strongly felt was unnecessary padding. There ends up being a lot of retreading, and it feels like an unwelcome detour from where the story had been heading. </p><p>This turning point is also when the simplicity I initially liked was thrown out of the window and the dreaded exposition dumps started to pile up on top of each other. As a whole, I still found the overall story to be enjoyable and the ending to be emotionally satisfying, but these pacing issues later on frustratingly squander much of the early momentum that had been built up.</p><p>But the real star of Visions of Mana, one that shines even when the story falters, is its combat. Fights are fast and frantic, with a number of systems to keep track of. You have your standard and special attacks alongside moves and spells, such as fireballs or shurikens, to mix things up and exploit enemy vulnerabilities. It’s also strategic because attacking, taking damage, and using moves slowly fills up the Class Strike gauge that then lets you perform a devastating attack you’ll want to unleash as often as you can (preferably at the exact right moments). During all this, you’ll also incorporate equipable items called Elemental Vessels, each of which provides its own special ability. For example, the Luna Globe will briefly create a small bubble on the battlefield that slows down enemies while speeding up attacks and spell casting times of the party.</p><p>However, when a character equips any given Elemental Vessel, they will also automatically be swapped to its associated class, which leads me to my absolute favorite mechanic in Visions of Mana: the class system. While the function of the Luna Globe itself will never change, the role, moves, and abilities of the character equipped with it will, and every character has a class entirely unique to them for every element available. </p><p>The Luna Globe will transform Val into an Aegis, changing him from his default melee role into a tank that lets him wield a lance and shield rather than his usual sword, but Careena will instead become a Moon Charterer and takes on a buff-support role through fan dancing. As an Aegis, Val can use a move to aggro enemies and gains an ability that allows him to survive what would otherwise have been a fatal blow with 1HP once per battle, and it’s the way these options come into play as you swap around that really highlights the fun of each class</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The real star of Visions of Mana is its combat and class system.</p></div><p>You’ll unlock even more moves and abilities for each Vessel thanks to the Elemental Plot, which acts as an upgrade system. The key difference between those two types of actions is that any moves you learn are permanent and can be equipped regardless of a character’s class, whereas abilities are tied to the class itself. So Val won’t get that protection from a fatal blow unless he’s an Aegis, but he’ll always have the option to add the aggro move to his repertoire, and that provides an exciting reason not to invest solely in one class.</p><p>But the coolest part? When equipping an Elemental Vessel to a character for the first time, you get treated to a wonderfully cheesy costume transformation cutscene straight out of a Super Sentai show as they don their new thematic outfits and weapons. Even if I didn’t really want to equip a character with a particular Vessel, I’d always do so at least once because the cinematic never failed to put a huge grin on my face. And don’t worry — once you’ve done the initial transformation sequence, you can just swap between classes at the press of a button in the menu screen between encounters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even more depth is added to combat by Ability Seeds, which are obtained through quests, chests, and battles. Some Seeds grant you passive bonuses like upping your stats while others grant you an entirely new move to use. Later on you’ll even be able to transfer the Corestones of defeated enemies and bosses into more powerful Seeds. A particular favorite of mine let me summon a late-game boss at my leisure to unleash some serious damage.</p><p>All of these systems tie together in a way that encourages strategy over button mashing. I had my preferred classes for certain characters, but some situations called for me to invest upgrade points into a Vessel I’d never use on them just to unlock certain moves, or even reclass them entirely. That might sound restrictive, but I actually liked that it encouraged me to branch out and try classes for characters I initially wouldn't have wanted to, and prevents you from putting all your eggs in one basket. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bosses can be tough if you’re not taking advantage of all your options.</p></div><p>For instance, normally I liked to have Morley use the class associated with the water Elemental Vessel, which transforms him into a hybrid of a stage magician and Gambit from X-Men who can stun enemies. But to defeat one particularly challenging boss, I had to switch him to a class that could maximize damage output thanks to its focus on critical hits. This also meant swapping some Ability Seeds that focused on boosting his critical damage and hit rate for complete synergy.</p><p>You’ll want to make sure you understand how to make the most of each class like this, because bosses in Visions of Mana can be tough even on the normal difficulty level if you’re not taking advantage of all your options. There are some really inventive boss designs, both visually and mechanically. Some might heavily focus on area-of-effect attacks while others will snatch your Elemental Vessel from you, temporarily preventing you from using it. Every boss kept me on the edge of my seat, and slaying them always felt rewarding.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Nick's Favorite RPGs</h3><p>Need an RPG recommendation? In no particular order, here are a few of my personal picks from my favorite genre.</p></div><p>Exploration also makes up a huge bulk of Visions of Mana. From lush jungles to snowy tundras to seaside villages, every single location feels unique and lets the gorgeous art style shine — it's vibrant and looks like something out of a storybook, which fits the fantastical tone. Hidden chests and collectables had me exploring every inch of the map and pulled me to optional areas I otherwise would have breezed right by. There are side quests, collectables, and more still left for me to tackle, too, and I can’t wait to dive right back in to complete everything Visions of Mana has to offer.</p><p>That said, while the art style itself is great, I did notice a fair share of visual bugs. There are a lot of moments where the lipsyncing didn’t match up, and at one point a character was speaking without their mouth moving at all. I also ran into a few huge framerate drops despite playing in performance mode on PlayStation 5, though these were extremely rare.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

DualSense controllers are increasing from the equivalent of around $65 to $80, and the PlayStation Portal is increasing from around $205 to $240.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>The price hike is a result of "recent challenging external environment, including the current fluctuations in the global economic situation, and the impact it will have on our business," Sony said. There's no word on this price increase hitting other regions.</p><p>It's the latest price hike for the PS5, which has, unusually, gone up in price since launching in 2020. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-xs-prices-raised-in-japan">It's a similar situation for Microsoft's Xbox Series X and S</a>.</p><p>The PlayStation 5 is still selling well with 61.7 million units sold as of August 2024 but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-down-from-last-year-sony-reveals">Sony revealed sales were down compared to 2023</a>. The decline was somewhat expected, however, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-sets-sales-record-but-just-misses-target-sony-predicts-further-decline-this-year">Sony lowered its overall PS5 sales target for this financial year to 18 million units</a> from the 21 million units it targeted last year.</p><p>This itself was down from an initial target of 25 million units sold, but Sony ultimately failed to accomplish either as it ended the year on 20.8 million. This was still a PS5 sales record though.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-are-all-the-ps5-games">Many will point to the lack of PS5 exclusives</a> as a potential reason for hardware sales declining, and Sony has already indicated no new games from its major franchises will be released this financial year. That means no Spider-Man, God of War, The Last of Us, Ratchet and Clank, Horizon, Ghost of Tsushima, or whatever else.</p><p>Sony is heavily rumored to be ready to launch a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro</a> later in 2024.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>A new report on Toys for Bob has claimed Crash Bandicoot 5 was cancelled in favour of live-service online games.</p>
<p>The report comes from gaming historian Liam Robertson, who revealed this Crash Bandicoot game would have been a single-player 3D platformer, which would serve as a direct sequel to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>.</p>
<p>While that is all much to be expected, Robertson's video also featured concept art and potential story ideas for the Crash sequel, including a Spyro team up. "Crash and Spyro were intended to be the two playable characters," Robertson said.</p>

<p>However, when Crash 5 was still in the very early days of development, it was cancelled by publisher Activision in favour of live-service multiplayer games.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Activision considered Crash Bandicoot 4's sales to be underwhelming. After that, team members were then moved on to work on other titles, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-rumble-gets-june-release-date-closed-beta-available-with-pre-orders">which was released last year</a>. This particular game failed to ignite much interest, however, and in March it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-rumble-support-ends-after-nine-months-as-developer-splits-with-activision">no further content would be released</a>.</p>

<p>As for Toys for Bob - which along with Crash Bandicoot and Spyro is also known for Skylanders - the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">announced it was parting ways with Activision to become an independent company again</a> back in January. Then in March of this year, it was claimed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-4-reportedly-in-early-development-at-toys-for-bob">new entry in the Spyro series was in development with Toys for Bob</a>.</p>
<p>The studio once again got tongues wagging in May, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/toys-for-bob-website-update-leads-to-new-crash-bandicoot-or-spyro-speculation">Toys for Bob updated its website with a new logo</a>, leading to further fan speculation of a new Crash Bandicoot or Spyro game.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can currently get your hands on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-august-line-up-announced">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy via Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p><span>Barring a successful remake of the third Mana title in the series, it’s been seventeen years since Square-Enix brought a new title to the console masses (the last entry was a mobile and PlayStation Vita exclusive in Japan). As Square-Enix continues to revive franchises from the vault, it’s refreshing to see them pay homage to a series that has persisted since the original Nintendo GameBoy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-demo-out-now-on-pc-playstation-and-xbox/">Visions of Mana</a> is the first of the series to make its way onto PlayStation 5, but does it feel like a proper next-gen adventure?</span></p>

<p><span>Players assume the role of Val, a Soul Guard tasked with guiding Alms of each element on a pilgrimage to the Mana Tree, where they’re sacrificed for the continued prosperity of the land. Failure to make the journey or shirk off the duties typically results in the decimation of an entire town, as the opening prologue makes clear. Nevertheless, it’s a sacred duty that Val and his childhood friend are all too keen on embarking on.</span></p>
<p><span>Along the journey to the Mana Tree, Val and his childhood friend Hinna meet four other Alms each willing to sacrifice their lives all the same. Visions of Mana presents a world where sacrifice is all but expected of those chosen by the faeries and spirits, with few to question the futility of it all. However, as Val ventures from region to region, solving everyday problems or befriending the locals, players will see firsthand what happens when that cycle is broken.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Visions of Mana brings the action RPG combat to new heights for the series, empowering Val and his entourage with mobility and finesse. Combos interweave quick and heavy attacks, with many inputs being held for an additional attack. Blocking and dodging are a key component of survivability in ways that the Mana series never truly utilized before. There is still an element of pausing combat with the series’ signature Ring Menus to cast magics or use healing items in a pinch. Players can also pause the combat and issue commands to their fellow party members, such as telling one party member to revive the other while you focus on damage dealing or playing the role of a tank and drawing the enemy’s focus away.</span></p>
<p><span>The Class system in Visions of Mana is something that I found to be somewhat lacking in execution. As players gain the blessing of each element, characters are bestowed with the ability to unlock a new class of that specific element. While earlier Mana games would have locked players into their class choices, players can freely swap between elemental classes at any time, with the main caveat being that no two characters can share the same element at a time. </span></p>
<p><span>With a base class and one for each of the eight elements, players can freely swap around archetypes across nine total classes. These classes each come with one of three different weapon types for each character, so just because you might want to leave the fire element on one character doesn’t mean Val would be locked out of using his favorite weapon. As for Val’s arsenal, players can pick between a simple one-handed sword, a combination of lance and shield, or a massive two-handed sword. The other four characters have more versatility to their weapon types which all have a distinctively different feel to one another.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Visions-of-Mana_20240813233337.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Class growth is one of the weaker elements of Visions of Mana. Each class has a single horizontal track that unlocks new spells and passive abilities at a predictable rate. While players can freely bring the spells from one class to another, the passive abilities are locked per class with some of the more interesting skills available to the same elemental class as another party member, so there were several party class combinations that I would have loved to try but couldn’t as they shared the same element across multiple classes. Some classes are simply far better for each character than any other. As the Archmage class is unlocked for Palamena, for example, no other class of hers comes anywhere close to matching the magical attack stat or damage output; similarly, Careena is an unstoppable force with her Dark element class.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Multiple difficulty modes are available to the player from the onset of Visions of Mana and I stuck with Hard Mode almost exclusively through my playthrough. This held a nice balance between taking massively increased damage while limiting the number of healing items that players can bring into combat at a time; players will have the usual stash of up to 99 of a given item but may only be able to take in a fraction of those candies or cups of wishes per encounter. With enemies routinely dealing upwards of a hundred damage per attack as early as the middle of the adventure, Visions of Mana’s Hard Mode is geared towards those who want to take full advantage of the defensive capabilities in combat to survive. </span></p>
<p><span>Val’s role as a Soul Guard felt best suited to using the lance and shield combo, as he would naturally gain abilities to draw the enemies' attention and even absorb damage by empowering his shield. Players shouldn’t consider themselves locked into any particular difficulty as they can freely switch outside combat. For those on a masochistic streak, an advanced difficulty level is unlockable upon completing the main campaign which comes with higher growth caps for each character to compensate.</span></p>

<p><span>Visions of Mana features a lot of retreading familiar ground as players will routinely return to earlier cities to solve less-pressing issues than saving the world regularly to the point where I felt like so much of the adventure felt like padding to stretch an already lengthy runtime. By the time I saw Val’s journey to its end, I had easily clocked in somewhere between sixty and seventy hours along the way. In that time, I routinely went back to each and every town at the start of each chapter to see what new side quests were available to undertake; managing this feat before the likes of fast travel were unlocked made this a far more obnoxious chore while I soon learned that it’s possible to fast travel from any save point on the same island to another (you’ll still need to make use of a certain aquatic mode of transportation or flight to go between the various continents). Many of the side quests were basic fetch quests that could largely be overlooked for the common rewards, while others granted equipable accessories with passive boons.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Overall, Visions of Mana is a solid entry in the storied tales of the Mana Tree that action RPG fans will appreciate. While there are some pacing issues and overall padding to the game’s length, players will have little complaint about the title’s length for a series that traditionally wraps up by the 15-20 hour mark. It may not be the most memorable tale of the Mana Tree, but it certainly offers the most enjoyable combat to date.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/visions-of-mana-review-exceptional-venture<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2024, where there’s been chaos and negativity around every corner for several years now, <em>Visions of Mana</em> offers a charming respite that feels like a cool glass of water in the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For over 30 years, <em>Mana </em>games have been making their mark on the RPG genre. I had a chance to review <em>Visions of Mana</em> ahead of its launch, and it was my first experience with the series. It was more than I hoped for.</p>
<p>With an absolutely stellar story, lovable characters, fun combat, and a beautiful world, <em>Visions of Mana</em> is an adventure I’d recommend to anyone, RPG fan or not.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Alm Adventure in <em>Visions of Mana</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/visions-of-mana-meeting-palamena.jpg?itok=2u_6N8Gz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/visions-of-mana-meeting-palamena.jpg?itok=ZphAq3vJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first four characters have a special bond in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> follows the story of Val and Hinna, the Soul Guard and Alm of Fire. Every four years, each element chooses an Alm. That Alm travels to the Mana Tree to sacrifice their soul to the Mana Goddess, ensuring that Mana continues through the land.</p>
<p>The Soul Guard meets with all the Alms to make a journey to the Mana Tree, protecting them along the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The premise of the story is simple, but the story itself is anything but. Without spoiling it, the crew encounters problems along the way. Everything builds up beautifully, and the conclusion left me in tears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, I was worried about it feeling a bit cliche. However, parts of the story are executed and written so well that cliche was the last adjective in my mind. Both the journey and the end result exceeded my expectations, and it created such a great stage for everything else in <em>Visions of Mana</em> to shine.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Visions of Mana’s Lovable Alms</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-early-crew-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=gJT1RGZD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-early-crew-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=cGzpD0ML 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Visions of Mana</em>'s cast are so fun, and their growth is well done.</figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest reasons the story worked so well was because of its character. Hinna and Val, the original two party members, are so wonderful. They’re sweet and wholesome, and their relationship is precious.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/visions-of-mana-preview-cute-relaxing-and-fun">preview</a>, I had high hopes for Hinna’s character. As it turns out, those hopes weren't just met, but things worked better than I could’ve imagined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the main crew – Morley, Careena, Palamena, and Julei – are just as lovely. The characters I wasn’t immediately fond of grew on me quickly, and by the end, I loved them all. The game wouldn’t have been the same without this group.</p>
<p>The group’s dynamics were done well, as they grew closer together and developed relationships with each other as they journeyed. It felt very natural and like every friend group I’ve been a part of in my own life. I loved seeing them talk and banter with each other in the story and just through exploration in general.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/careena-and-ramcoh-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=DQQzm68m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/careena-and-ramcoh-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=x_Ysu4_C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Careena was my least favorite character at the start, but she ended up being one of my favorites by the end.</figcaption></figure><p>The characters didn’t just grow together, they also developed in their own ways. Each and every character is challenged in some way, and they all grow past it by the end. This was touching to see, and it’s where a lot of the hopeful messages in the game are shown.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Character-based Combat in Visions of Mana</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bridge-view-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=N1GGv_2f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bridge-view-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=HgIVgMYY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fighting in environments like this was beautiful.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a lot to love about the combat system in <em>Visions of Mana</em>, and it all centers around the characters. Each character has a unique play style, and players can form teams of three to take on ARPG fights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, each character can be given an Elemental Vessel. These can change their stats, weapons, and even their appearance (including in cutscenes, a little touch that went far). Each Elemental Vessel has its own skill tree of sorts to upgrade, giving characters special and more powerful moves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was fun to tinker with – I loved seeing how each character changed with each vessel, and it gives players incentives to explore the world and have fun with combat. Combat itself is fairly simple, but the strategy going into it is where the fun really happens. Plus, simple combat isn’t a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boss designs in <em>Visions of Mana</em> are so unique. The entire game is flooded with bright colors that give the game a light feel compared to the main storyline where characters are literally sacrificing themselves to a goddess.</p>
<p>The bosses continue this light feel, mixing poppy colors with fun designs that are never too terrifying. I actually looked forward to seeing what each boss would look like and what the fights would be like.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Minor Exploration Problems in Visions of Mana</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jungle-biome-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=_SYPtEOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jungle-biome-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=NJDNSTiG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are a ton of different biomes to check out and explore in&nbsp;<em>Visions of Mana</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Visions of Mana</em> is one of the only open-world games I’ve wanted to get lost in. Exploration is incredibly rewarding, and it’s genuinely just fun. The small groups of enemies scattered around are the perfect size, making them quick but satisfying to take down.</p>
<p>Running around the incredibly varied biomes and gorgeous scenery was more fun than I ever thought it’d be.</p>
<p>However, there were a few minor problems. Occasionally, my inputs would overshoot or undershoot where I was trying to go. It made interacting with some things, like save points or chests, difficult at times.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were problems with the auto-tracking system at times. For example, if I needed to use a special item, the auto-tracking system didn’t have a way to show me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These problems were very minor, and they were the only real problems I encountered during my time with <em>Visions of Mana</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Visions of Mana</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mount-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=PZG3Pglm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mount-in-visions-of-mana.jpg?itok=Ztps-V42 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riding through the world on the back of this adorable creature is just as fun as the combat.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not often that I would recommend an ARPG game to gamers who don’t like ARPGs, but <em>Visions of Mana</em> is one that I would. The story, characters, combat, and world are so well done that it’s a treat to experience, and one I think anyone can enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, it’s perfect for newcomers to the series. The marketing has said that there are friendly faces from other games, so it’s fun for veterans as well. This was my first experience with a <em>Mana </em>game, but it won’t be my last by any means – <em>Collections of Mana</em> is now on my wishlist.&nbsp;</p>
