These awards call on a "panel of expert gaming jurors" and the community to decide the winners.</p>
<p>The recent Switch 2 release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has taken out "best gameplay" of the show, placing it ahead of other titles like <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. Although Mario Kart World missed out on the gameplay award, it did win "best Nintendo Switch 2 game" of the event, beating not only Donkey Kong Bananza but also upcoming releases like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4okzqyh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Apart from this, Pokémon was the winner of the "best booth", Capcom won the award for the "best lineup", and the anticipated indie title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> won the best trailer.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">see the rest of the award winners</a> along with the assessment procedure and criteria on the Gamescom website. To be eligible for an award at Gamescom, a game needs to be present at the event, and developers need to "submit their games for the different categories of the Gamescom award" (there are submission fees, too).</p>
<p>These are some of the first awards for Nintendo's Switch 2 exclusives, and we're still waiting to get our hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and Metroid Prime 4.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many different ways to experience The Witcher these days. My own entry point into this world was playing through the first Witcher game back when it first came out in 2007. But it wasn't until The Witcher 3 that I really felt the depth of the story. I loved exploring the world, playing Gwent, and getting an up close and personal look at Geralt's complicated love life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a similar feeling with the first couple of seasons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-witcher">The Witcher series on Netflix</a>, but now that Henry Cavill has left the show I find myself mostly just looking forward to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-iv">next Witcher game</a> in the franchise. Since that game is still years away, however, I've been recently looking into The Witcher TTRPG as a potential new way to experience that world. It's currently only $15 for a six-book bundle at Humble Bundle and it certainly looks intriguing at that price.</p><div catalogid="af01313a-a9f9-4c39-b028-cf6df9563c2e" id="227219"><div id="227219" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Six digital books included</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Witcher TTRPG Bundle</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3">What comes with this bundle</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This Witcher TTRPG bundle includes a total of six books. You can get the full bundle by spending $15 or you can choose to pay more and support charity. According to the website, this bundle supports <a href="https://childrensmiraclenetworkhospitals.org/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Children's Miracle Network Hospitals</a>. Here's all of the digital books included with your purchase:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Witcher TTRPG Core Rulebook</li><li>The Witcher: A Book of Tales</li><li>The Witcher: Tome of Chaos</li><li>The Witcher: A Witcher's Journal</li><li>The Witcher: Lords &amp; Lands</li><li>The Witcher TTRPG - Easy Mode</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Is The Witcher TTRPG worth playing?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Witcher Tabletop RPG was created by <a href="https://rtalsoriangames.com/witcher-trpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R. Talsorian Games</a> in collaboration with CD Projekt Red. The core game is set somewhere between <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the video game timeline. Since I haven't had the chance to play the game myself, I did a bit of digging into reviews and Reddit threads to see if it's worth playing. The <a href="https://spritesanddice.com/reviews/witcher-ttrpg-review/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most comprehensive review</a> I could find comes from a site called Sprites and Dice. The author goes into a lot of detail about the core rule book and subsequent books available while looking at it through the lens of an experienced D&amp;D player. I recommend checking that out if you need a deeper look at what you'll get with this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a pretty <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/fd9ecn/opinions_on_the_witcher_ttrpg/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">helpful Reddit thread</a> I found where multiple people have given their thoughts about this TTRPG. A common theme throughout that is that those who actually played it enjoyed it overall. One user complimented the character creation involved while pointing out the imbalances in some of the classes. Basically, if you don't decide to be a Witcher or a Mage you won't get the chance to engage with the full rulebook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Disclosure</strong></em><em>: Humble Bundle is part of IGN Entertainment, the division of Ziff Davis that includes GamesIndustry.biz, IGN, and MapGenie.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Aug 22, 2025 11:45 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-tabletop-rpg-books-are-only-15-at-humble-bundle-right-now]]></content:encoded>

DICE has announced that there's now a penalty for making consecutive jumps that lowers the jump height. Momentum carried from a slide into a jump has also been tweaked to reduce its speed. Nevertheless, Battlefield 6 principal game designer Florian "DRUNKKZ3" Le Bihan wants players to know that the movement changes "are not drastic."</p><p>"Movement is also getting more responsive in general in places that have felt a bit clunky before. so there is a lot more that is getting quality improvements [and] polish in this same area," wrote Le Bihan on <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1958563338301935939" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "Adding diminishing returns to jumping is what we're actually doing, an initial slide or an initial jumps will not be affected. We're still trying to retain depth to movement with some skill curve to it, just making sure it doesn't become insane."</p><p>The Battlefield 6 devs also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-devs-address-open-beta-feedback-double-down-on-changes-to-rush/1100-6534180/" data-ref-id="1100-6534180">defended the changes to Rush mode</a> in the beta, including smaller lobbies of 24 players for 12v12 matches. According to the programing team, Rush mode doesn't work as well with more than 24 players at a time.</p><p>Another upcoming change <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-devs-address-open-beta-feedback-double-down-on-changes-to-rush/1100-6534180/" data-ref-id="1100-6534180">change before for launch</a> is the nerfing of the M87A1 shotgun, which was overpowered in the beta.

<p>It's almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After a long wait and even some delays, we're now just weeks out from the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>.</p>
<p>The 'hands on' previews have been rolling in from Gamescom this week, so we're rounding up a handful here including our own. This is the final demo before the game goes on sale to the public on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, here's a summary of our own thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I think you'll all love it, if you do like Hollow Knight - they've absolutely smashed it here... it runs beautifully...the atmosphere, the graphics, it all just plays totally perfect together"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186836 @ 1755933558 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say? Here's the rundown:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview-gamescom-2025/">GamesRadar+:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is building smartly on exceptionally solid foundations, and it's doing so with a greater focus on aggression, decisive action, and proactive decision making."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hollow-knight-silksong/preview">PCGamesN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong feels exactly like we hoped it would. Beautiful yet brutal. Charming yet challenging. It doesn't seem like a massive departure from the original, but with a few tweaked and rebalanced techniques, it still freshens up the formula."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/not-only-is-hollow-knight-silksong-real-ive-played-it-and-its-harder-and-faster-than-the-original-but-is-it-better">Eurogamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Silksong is the game of the moment. And Team Cherry has opted to make this more difficult and a bit more awkward. For platforming fans like me, that's catnip - but will the average player curious in the franchise be so intrigued?"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/">Insider Gaming:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The gameplay loop is back. The slick dashes, jumps, and swipes are a key part of Hornet’s arsenal. Tactical jabs and prods, using Hornet’s agility and nimble frame to evade attacks; these are hallmarks of what made the original so special and accessible."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/hollow-knight-silksong-preview-gamescom/">The Gamer:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I saw nothing to suggest it is reinventing the wheel, although I don’t doubt there will be more than a few abilities to differentiate things. In my humble opinion, this isn’t a bad thing. Hollow Knight is such a unique Metroidvania, that another story in that world is fine by me. After the eternal wait, we’re agonisingly close to playing Team Cherry’s next adventure, and it already feels like it was worth the wait."</p>

                <p>Steam darling Peak's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest patch</a> changes the game for Steam Deck players and speedrunners who love nothing more than a good glitch.</p><p>Peak version 1.25.a makes a few major changes and a bunch of minor ones. The biggest alteration is that the game is now Steam Deck Verified.</p><p>"Finally.....the game is good on Steam Deck," the team wrote in the patch notes. "Deck players will know it's been good for a while! The Mesa Update added the last of controller support needed and with this patch we've added some text adjustments needed to get the Verified badge."</p><p>There are a whole bunch of fixes and adjustments as well. Most prominently, it's much harder to glitch your way to the top of the mountain than it has been over the last couple of weeks.</p><p>"Made fog walls taller so you can't shoot over them to win the game in a minute with the Scout Cannon exploit," Team Peak wrote. "A lot of you asked us not to change the Scout Cannon but no promises were made about the map."</p><p>Previously, players could use the Scout Cannon to blast themselves so high that they were able to clear all five of the game's biomes and reach the goal at the peak. With the fog wall change, cannons can still send players ridiculously far under the right circumstances, but they're now much more likely to smack into the wall of shifting fog that separates each biome and fall to their deaths. That said, we did manage to use the cannon to clear at least a couple of biomes before crashing back to earth when testing the update, so ridiculous cannon stunts remain possible.</p><p>Interestingly, this patch also added the ability to toggle off The Looker, a character who could randomly appear behind certain rocks, and who would disappear if you got too close or looked at them for too long. Even if you do leave the feature enabled, the character's appearance will be more rare moving forward.</p><p>One issue many Peak players have run into is that a bunch of the game's merit badges, tied to its Steam achievements, don't seem to unlock, even after doing everything required to earn them. Those issues have been resolved for the Cool Cucumber, Plunderer, Clutch, and First Aid badges.</p><p>Other issues addressed in this patch include problems with beehives (insect phobia textures work now, and you can't put beehives into your backpack anymore), alongside several balance changes (hot rocks in the Kiln now damage players correctly, the Cure-All item can cure some thorns in the Mesa biome, and the Magic Beanstalk is faster to climb).</p><p>Peak is the latest and one of the best examples of the genre that gamers have began to lovingly (or not-so-lovingly) as "friendslop"--relatively simple co-op-first games that include an element of humor, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/repo/" data-ref-id="5000-662250">R.E.P.O.</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lethal-company/" data-ref-id="5000-566928">Lethal Company</a>. Getting to the top of Peak's mountain requires skill and knowledge, but things like exploding spores, the fact that you can lose consciousness and fall off the mountain, and lots of other hazards, are undeniably meant to cause laughter.</p><p>Peak has sold over 10 million copies on Steam according to Geoff Keighley, and has recently added features like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">Mesa biome</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">cannibalism</a>, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-going-to-be-the-next-silksong.1278672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just when fans were beginning to lose faith – or at least get extremely sick of hearing people trot out the same tired memes during every Geoff Keighley game showcase – <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/hollow-knight-silksong-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returned</a>. Set to release <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in just a couple short weeks</a>, it’s a real video game with levels and characters and everything. That in mind, we’re left with a question: Which half-imaginary whisper of a game will take its place? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we hazard a few guesses.</p><p>This time around, we discuss <em>Silksong</em>, which looks like… more <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Cool! Also, the developers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have said</a> they will not be sending out pre-release review code, citing concern that it would be “unfair” to Kickstarter backers and regular players. But perhaps that approach is better for interesting writing about the game – and games in general – in the long run?</p><p>Then we talk about other cool games that received a Gamescom spotlight: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, <em>Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_Xmv9eAIZA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Denshattack</em></a>, which looks way better than all those other games. Lastly, we discuss the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact of Trump’s tariffs on video games</a> – for the first time in maybe ever, console prices are going up toward the end of a generation, not down – and how they represent a stealth tax on <em>GTA VI</em> (which will probably be very expensive in its own right). Oh, and Chris decides to just make his own PlayStation 5, until he realizes that it’d probably land him in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can spend half a decade quietly crafting a masterpiece video game (first we will have to learn how to make games, so it will take even longer than <em>Silksong</em>).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Given that <em>Silksong </em>is real and about to come out, what other super long-awaited games are left? What is the next <em>Silksong</em>, essentially? Now, the obvious answer is <em>GTA VI</em>, but that’s coming out next year; it’s in that sort-of-already-real space.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s real.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong><em>Half-Life 3</em>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> If <em>Half-Life 3</em> even exists in any capacity.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Is <em>Pragmata </em>coming out finally?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, I played it at Summer Game Fest! It’s a <em>Lost Planet</em>-ass mid-2000s video game. It’s awesome. I really enjoyed the demo.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That’s all I need. We’ve gotta get code for that.</p><p>Whatever the guy who made<em> Shadow Of The Colossus</em>’ next game is. That’s already cued up [to be a game people will have to wait forever to play].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Some people in chat are saying <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, but I think that’s in the same space as <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> where we’ve seen some of it. We don’t have an exact date yet, but it is real. <em>Bloodborne 2</em>? We don’t know if we’ll ever get that. <em>Wolf Among Us 2</em> is a good one.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Parameters are, it actually has to have been announced in some capacity.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The big one, in my mind, is <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>. All we’ve seen is a logo, and it has <a href="https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-vi-trailer-six-years-later" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been six years</a> – seven years now! – since we saw that logo. And that’s it. <em>Starfield </em>came out and was kind of a dud, and now we’re just waiting.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> There’s a Nintendo Switch RPG that’s, like, a cop RPG, and it’s from a Japanese developer. It’s been in development hell for a minute. What was it? <em>Decapolice</em>. That one’s mine. It was supposed to come out three years ago, I want to say.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The sequel to <em>Octopath Traveler</em>: <em>Decapolice</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote down some others: <em>Skate 4</em> kind of already exists, so that doesn’t count. <em>Ark 2</em> does, though. They’ve been working on that forever. We got that weird trailer with Vin Diesel 8,000 years ago, and its release date remains TBD.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> People in chat are mentioning<em> The Last Night</em>. The guy making it wound up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15802708/the-last-night-hands-on-gamergate-cyberpunk-e3-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being a Gamergater</a> and then kinda disappeared?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Which one?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh! <em>The Last Night</em>! That pixel art sidescroll-y noir thing. We first saw that in… what? 2018? 2017? I think that game just disappeared into the ether. I don’t know if we’ll ever see that again.</p><p>Another one: <em>Fable</em>. The one game that Microsoft hasn’t canceled yet. Because I was gonna say, there’s a whole raft of Microsoft games, but then a bunch of them got canceled earlier this year. It’s like, well, so much for that.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, a lot of games that would have been on this list just got canceled. You also have the <em>Black Panther </em>game and the <em>Wonder Woman</em> game, for example – these things that seemed potentially interesting and then got smothered in the cradle.&nbsp;</p><p>And then finally, my sort of joke answer to this question that I do think counts as a valid answer: the <em>Prince of Persia</em> remake. You would think it wouldn’t be that difficult to get across the finish line, but it keeps getting delayed and pushed back, and we still haven’t really seen anything substantial of it. But at the same time, I can’t imagine people in Geoff Keighley chats being like “<em>Prince of Persia</em> remake when??? Show us the<em> Prince of Persia </em>remake!”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s not really something to rally around.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>. That’ll be the one people talk about any time there’s a hint of something fantastical or akin to <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>’ vibe in a Geoff Keighley showcase. “Oh, it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>! <em>Elder Scrolls</em>!” Then when it’s not, they’ll be like “Noooo, I don’t care anymore! This looks like trash!”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays"><h3>Indie Devs Are Delaying Their Games Because Of Silksong [Update]</h3></a><p>'I feel like a little krill trying to not get eaten by a blue whale,' wrote one developer</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker"><h3>A ‘Game Capture Director’ Is The Person Who Gets The Gameplay Footage For A Video Game Trailer</h3></a><p>'The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both Jaws and Pac-Mac in a single trailer'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-silksong-gta-vi-elder-scrolls-vi]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you’ve played video games long enough, you eventually develop something of a “Spidey Sense” when you see a game that seems like it’s going to be extra special. You never know until the final product is on your hard drive, of course, but more often than not, that sixth sense is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced, a 2.5D action-adventure game drenched in an absolutely stunning sci-fi cyberpunk pixel-art aesthetic – complete with incredible camera work and moody music – is making that Spidey Sense tingle. I’d already played a brief three-part demo over a year ago, which only reinforced that feeling I first got after the initial reveal four years ago. This time I got to play the first 30 or so minutes of the campaign, and it did nothing to dampen my enthusiasm for what could be – if the rest of the game delivers – an all-time indie classic in the same category as Limbo, Braid, Inside, Balatro, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right from the jump it’s obvious that Replaced’s art director knows what the heck they’re doing. The look of this dystopia, set in an alternate-history 1980s America, takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography. Toss in just the right amount of depth of field and you get a world that looks lived-in. It oozes griminess and despair but somehow makes them look gorgeous. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaced is set in an alternate-history 1980s America and takes the 16-bit graphics I grew up with and plusses them up with soft dynamic lighting and some absolutely brilliant cinematography.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as R.E.A.C.H., an AI that lives in the body of a man named Warren, who wakes up after having been literally left for dead amongst a pile of corpses. The world of Phoenix City you see before you is the evolution of a worldwide nuclear event that occurred several decades prior. There are diaries, news articles, and other ephemeral bits of world-building information scattered around for you to collect and read in your Wingman – think of it as this cyberpunk world’s version of a 1980’s Walkman-meets-Palm-Pilot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Replaced starts simply enough, keeping you on a left-to-right 2D plane, old-school-style, and having you do little more than some basic platforming. But it establishes its setting so amazingly well – and quickly to boot. Whether it’s the aforementioned digital clippings revealing pieces of the radiation-coated backstory or the searchlight-wielding snipers who will gun you down in one shot if they spot you, things are clearly grim in Phoenix City. Before long you’ll have to fight to survive, as you’ll be forced to throw hands with a couple of faction members and soon entire gangs of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s where Replaced will next impress you: it’s packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. Enemies who are about to attack will get a yellow lightning bolt over their heads. Press Y when you see that to instantly counter them. And then – my fellow Arkham veterans know where this is going – when a red lightning bolt appears over a foe’s head, that means they’re about to unleash an unblockable/uncounter-able attack, and you need to press the A button at just the right moment in order to dodge-roll away. Successful dodges and parries charge up a special-attack meter, which in Replaced’s case, means you get to either fire a shot from your found firearm at distance, or brutally execute an enemy if you’re at point-blank range. Of course, it’ll get more complicated; before long rifle-wielding bad guys will enter the fray, and the timing window changes on their (obviously) unblockable bullets. Enemy heavies will complicate things too. There was just one in the opening minutes of Replaced, and, probably by design, he wasn’t too tough to tango with. All of his attacks are unblockable, and he takes a ton of hits to bring down, but he didn’t have friends left by the time we faced off, so it was a very straightforward introduction to the higher-hit-point heavies you’ll face off against later in the game. So I expect the fisticuffs to ramp up significantly over the course of Replaced’s runtime in every sense of the word: number of enemies, difficulty, etc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon Replaced began introducing the 2.5D elements, literally expanding its world by letting me walk to the background or foreground to get something I needed to progress onwards. You’ll need to grab onto dumpsters to slide them around in order to climb up on them to reach a higher ladder, or to bridge a gap, just as one example. While this opening sequence didn’t offer me too much freedom of movement within the environment, I know it eventually will, because I’ve seen it before in last year’s demo. I should add, though, that exploring will sometimes reward you with pickups that are often tucked out of plain sight – I won’t go so far as to call them secrets – and they’ll fill out your dossier and shed a little bit more light on this broken world, or give you an upgrade. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that Replaced is going to have replayability, per se, but if the developers do an awesome enough job at building out the backstory of Phoenix City, that might deliver enough motivation to want to go back and find all of the hidden bits of information. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Replaces is packing a proper Batman: Arkham combat system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s demo – again, since it was the very beginning of the game – also didn’t show off the biggest pleasant surprise from my initial hands-on with it last year: the RPG hiding under its 2.5D cyberpunk aesthetic. From the first couple of extremely impressive trailers, I’d thought that Replaced was “just” a side-scrolling action-adventure game. But no, it’s got sections packed with quest-giving NPCs and the ability to free-roam the area. I absolutely can’t wait to dig into more of this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But getting back to this newest slice of Replaced, I should take a moment to compliment the music. A moody synth soundtrack is key to nailing the vibe in any dystopian cyberpunk piece of media, and Replaced wastes no time confirming it understands the assignment in that department. And I’d actually like to get back to the visual identity of this game for a second as well. The pixel art, as you can already tell, is phenomenal, and the use of color and lighting is top-shelf, but I’d also like to shout out the animation. I’m not sure if this will make sense, but in attempting a retro look complemented by modern visual touches like in Replaced, there is such a thing as the animation being too good. I would argue that the development team at Sad Cat Studios has struck a perfect balance here. Neither R.E.A.C.H. nor his enemies move too smoothly. Instead, they have a slightly stilted movement to them, which only adds to the broken, beat-down spirit of Phoenix City, and it sells the neo-16-bit look even more perfectly, in my eyes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I reached the end of the demo build of Replaced, all I wanted was to play more. It is simply a captivating game from top to bottom, and I can’t wait to see where R.E.A.C.H.’s story goes as well as what the deeper plot reveals. I’m also eager to find out how much deeper the combat and RPG elements specifically go. I’d love nothing more than for my Spidey Sense to prove correct and for Replaced to be one of the best and most memorable games of 2026 (even if we already know that Grand Theft Auto 6 will dominate the headlines). We don’t have a release date for Replaced quite yet, but I get the sense that it’s close. Hopefully we’ll soon find out exactly when we can see just how special the final game is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

                <p dir="ltr">When I watch a great pro match of a fighting game like Marvel vs. Capcom 2 or Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, my reaction is equal parts awe and bafflement. The sheer speed and hyper-kinetic action flies by so quickly that I can only make sense of a percentage of what I'm seeing, and the people who have mastered the chaos must be a different species. Kirby Air Riders is like that: a bubblegum colorful confection of speed, agility, and action that feels overwhelming, but still fun to play.</p><p dir="ltr">My hands-on experience at Gamescom started with some tutorials showing the ropes of handling your ride. The ride accelerates automatically, which may seem like it suggests simplicity, but there's still a lot of finesse and fine control to handling your ride. Nailing a drift around a corner takes precise timing, and when you take a jump you can get a speed boost with a clean landing--which means tilting your racer slightly to land parallel if you're coming up on a hill. Those mechanics felt approachable and easy to grasp during the limited time of a demo, but had enough depth that the skill ceiling looks high.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is a sequel to Kirby's Air Ride, but the shift to Air <em>Riders</em> is a significant one. There's a particular emphasis on the characters themselves and their unique powers, and this is where I could most keenly sense Masahiro Sakurai's experience with the Smash Bros. series. It feels like an evolution of that, and bringing that spirit of balancing different power sets into a new racing context.</p><p dir="ltr">After the tutorial featured, I played as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-character-in-kirby-air-riders/2900-6901/" data-ref-id="2900-6901">two different characters</a>: Magalor, the antagonist of Kirby's Return to Dreamland; and Starman, a recurring Kirby enemy. The riders seem to handle slightly differently, but the major difference is their special moves. Magalor activates a massive beam that shoots behind him, hitting any opponents that are coming up on your tail. By contrast, Starman's special was not an offensive tool at all. Instead, he could fly into the air on command using your regular spin attack while the special was activated. This seems primarily suited to help reach high places, though in a pinch you could also use it to dodge, at the expense of some speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo mostly focused on the City Trials mode, which is separated into two parts. First you explore the wide-open hub area gathering power-ups and switching your weak starter vehicle for a better one. There's a layer of strategy here, as various icons that you collect give you increased defense, weight, boost, and so on. You can use these to compensate for any of your racer's weaknesses, or make a naturally strong aspect even stronger. Once the first phase is over, everyone's total power-ups get tallied up and your build gets taken into the second phase. I could imagine that, as players grow more familiar with the game, serious competitive players will start to optimize combinations of racers and air rides with which types of icons they should prioritize for collection.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

dir="ltr">The build you craft during this first phase has a huge bearing on how competitive you'll be in the second one. Once all the players tally up their powers, they're able to choose one of four game types, and the game will recommend one that's optimized for your build. Some are more combat-focused while others are centered more on racing. I chose the recommended mode in my first game, a combat/racing fusion with Magalor and held my own decently well. For my second game, I picked one of the modes that was not recommended (mainly in order to stay grouped with the other human players in our closed session) and my unoptimized build showed on the almost pure racing track. Plus, Starman's vertical-focused power just isn't the best for a regular race around an oval track, but maybe I just need to get good.</p><p dir="ltr">Both phases feel extremely fast, so while one is about prepping a build, they both reward skilled play. And it's easy to see, even from my limited experience, how choosing your rider, finding your ride, and gathering power-ups could lead to a fierce Kirby Air Riders meta, as advanced Air Riders players explore different options to optimize their competitive edge.</p><p dir="ltr">For casual players like myself, Kirby Air Riders looks to be a sweet experience to play with friends, especially in couch co-op, fueling a rowdy party atmosphere. But I suspect that there's going to be a whole other layer of the game, with the speed and skill of a fighting game, and that one seems destined for the competitive stage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a tough time for new video game IPs. According to a new report, Wildgate, the new online PvP game from developer Dreamhaven, has struggled with sales since it’s release.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/blizzard-co-founder-s-game-startup-struggles-amid-industry-glut?srnd=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg’s Cecilia D’Anastasio</a> reports that Wildgate has <strong>sold just 130,000 units</strong> in its first month plus. The data, which comes from a letter Dreamhaven co-founder Michael Morhaime sent to staff.</p>



<p>The Blizzard co-founder said that despite positive reviews from critics, the game performed below commercial expectations. It wasn’t just Wildgate that struggled, either. Dreamhaven’s other game, Sunderfolk, has sold just 62,000 copies since it released in April. Because of the struggles, he said, the company is looking for new financing. </p>



<p><strong>“Our monthly expenses are outpacing revenue,” </strong>Morhaime said in the letter, adding that Dreamhaven’s focus is to now <strong>“urgently”</strong> reduce costs. </p>



<p>He added that he is<strong> “committed”</strong> to making sure the studio survives its current financial turmoil.</p>



<p>Wildgate is currently available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. Through August 28, the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3504780/Wildgate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on sale on Steam</a> for under $20. In our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game earlier this year</a>, we said that Wildgate showed potential for being the multiplayer game of the year. The main concern, however, was getting players to buy in and keep them engaged with the game. Based on the current state of things, it appears that concern remains.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Wildgate and developer Dreamhaven? Let us know down below, and join this discussion and more in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Team Cherry's Hollow Knight sequel, Hollow Knight: Silksong, is finally releasing on September 4 after years of development and fears from the community that the game may never see the light of day. But Silksong is real, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">we've played it</a>, and the upcoming launch is looming so large that multiple game studios have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delayed their upcoming projects to get out of the way</a>. But why did Silksong take so long to make?</p><p>Team Cherry founders Ari Gibson and William Pellen said Silksong was not stuck in development hell or anything like that. The enormous success of the 2017 game--it's sold more than 15 million copies--allowed the Australia-based developers to develop the follow-up at their own pace.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"It was never stuck or anything," Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it."</p><p>Silksong was originally envisioned as an expansion to Hollow Knight, but it became a big enough project to shift to a full, standalone release. That's one of the reasons why it didn't come out sooner.</p><p>As for why Team Cherry went quiet and didn't discuss development updates with fans over the years, Gibson said the team opted not to because, "All we could really say is, 'We're still working on it.'"</p><p>Pellen added: "Instead of popping up and bugging people for the sake of it, it felt like our actual responsibility was just to work on the game."</p><p>At one point, Silksong was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/12/22175400/hollow-knight-silksong-sequel-xbox-game-pass-trailer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially scheduled to launch before June 2023</a>, and Pellen said the team did "genuinely believe" the game would make it out then. But that didn't happen, of course.</p><p>The wait could have been even longer. Gibson said Team Cherry has a development structure that allows its members to "see results fasts," with ideas turning into real elements of the game "almost immediately." That was a fun way to work, Gibson said, but it also presented challenges.</p><p>"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching," Gibson said. "Because I went, 'Everything I'm drawing here has to end up in the game. That's a cool idea, that's in. That's a cool idea, tha'ts in.' You realize, 'If I don't stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'"</p><p>Silksong will release on September 4 for console and PC, and <a href="https://google.com/search?q=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=silksong+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhAMgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPNIBCDMzNDZqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you'll be able to play it at launch via Game Pass. </a></p><p>"Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom this week</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/across-the-spider-verse-spider-man-lego-teen-animate-14-1850506788"><span>scene in </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span>: </span><i><span>Across the Spider-Verse</span></i></a> <span>that showed a Lego version of Peter Parker living his best blocky life? If you didn’t know, that segment was animated entirely by then 14-year-old animator Preston Mutanga, who caught the filmmaker’s attention after he recreated the movie’s first trailer in the style of a Lego movie. It’s been two years, and the now 16-year-old Mutanga is still hard at work building scenes and trailers from Lego blocks. His recent projects include making the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaY7pJbYDy8"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rl_VFCX_iaM"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> trailers look like something right out of a kid’s toy box, but it’s his latest incredible videos that have really caught my eye: faithful remakes of scenes from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, done in such spectacular fashion that they could have been an official collaboration between Sony, Netflix, and Lego.</span></p> <p><span>Mutanga has uploaded two videos featuring the Lego versions of Huntr/x to his TikTok account. One is a snippet of one of the coolest parts of the movie’s first musical number, “How It’s Done,” which shows the group skydiving down onto a blocky version of Seoul and kicking some demon booty on the way down.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The second is less action-packed but longer, and lets Mutanga add a cute nod to his </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>roots. It’s a scene, maybe a third of the way into the movie, after the demonic Saja Boys boy band has started getting their flirty, sexy demon claws into the hearts and minds of the world. They’ve weakened the Honmoon barrier between the real and demon worlds, and the girls are trying to figure out what to do while maintaining their Kpop girl group cover. Their manager, Bobby, comes in to give them an update on their rivals’ newfound virality, and as he scrolls through videos of the Boys’ fans dancing to their hit song “Soda Pop,” a familiar webslinger briefly appears on his phone.</span></p>   <p><span>Mutanga’s incredible work speaks for itself, but I will say I sure hope someone over at Lego or Sony is ready to give this kid a job when he’s of age.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Hell Let Loose Isn’t Going to The Pacific Theatre Anytime Soon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-pacific-theatre/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-hell-let-loose-isn%E2%80%99t-going-to-the-pacific-theatre-anytime-soon.1278600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Following the announcement of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I had the opportunity to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on with the game for the very first time </a>and quiz the developers on the decision as to why they haven’t yet gone to the Pacific Theatre with the original game.</p>



<p>The Pacific Theatre, in my view, has been a highly requested setting by the community for a while now, but for whatever reason, the developers have yet to bring it to life. So, quite jokingly, and before I got hands-on with Vietnam, I quizzed the developers as to why the Pacific Theatre isn’t a direction they’ve yet gone in.</p>



<p>I was told that, for the most part, the idea of Hell Let Loose going to Vietnam as a separate title in the franchise has been a plan for some years. For those unaware, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be developed in tandem with the original game, with no resources being moved away from the original. So if you’re a fan of the original game, it will continue to be developed at the same rate it is currently, with new content.</p>



<p>It was said that around 80 developers are currently working on Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, with around 30 developers on the original. However, in terms of resource allocation, I was told that some developers are working on both games, and these numbers will fluctuate based on the individual game’s requirements at any given time. </p>



<h2 id="h-hell-let-loose-pacific">Hell Let Loose: Pacific?</h2>



<p>Following my hands-on with Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, I circled back to the Pacific Theatre with the developers, where I was told that Hell Let Loose going to the Pacific Theatre isn’t out of the question, but what would that look like?</p>



<p>It was explained that although taking Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre is something that the team would want to take the franchise to, it would likely mean a whole new game, instead of just adding a few maps into the original.</p>



<p>The explanation continued by highlighting that the Pacific Theatre is characterized by large naval battles involving carriers, planes, the Bushido code, and so on. It was noted that it presents an entirely different atmosphere compared to fairly grounded fighting in Europe and Russia, where the foundations of Hell Let Loose were laid.</p>



<p>So similar to Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, it was heavily implied to me that a Pacific Theatre entry would likely require a new game entirely, offering players new ways to play while continuing the expansion of the Hell Let Loose franchise. Transparently, I was also told that taking even the original Hell Let Loose to the Pacific Theatre with even just a few new maps, weapons, and factions would be very resource heavy, and that it would probably make a lot more sense to build an entirely new experience from the ground up, similar to what they have done with Vietnam.</p>



<p>But ultimately, I was told that it all depends on what the community wants.</p>



<p>So, who knows, maybe in 4-5 years, a highly immersive Hell Let Loose: Pacific Theatre title is something we can all look forward to playing – If players want it! </p>



<p>Would you like to see the series take that direction after the release of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 might be the most talked-about game in the world, but that doesn’t stop Grand Theft Auto <strong>5 </strong>from still being extremely relevant. It remains one of the best-selling games right now, even though we’re a mere nine months (mere?) away from the launch of GTA 6, in May 2026.</p>



<p>At Gamescom, I was fortunate to run into GTA 5’s Ned Luke (Michael de Santa) and Shawn ‘Solo’ Fonteno (Franklin Clinton), and I took the opportunity to ask them about their expectations and excitement for Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-i-wanna-play-it-i-wanna-livestream-it">‘I Wanna Play It, I Wanna Livestream It!’</h2>



<p>Ned Luke and Shawn Fonteno were at Gamescom to promote the new ROG Xbox Ally as part of an ongoing partnership with Asus. The pair wasted no time revealing their handheld gaming devices to me and walking me through some of the key features before we took a dive into the world of Grand Theft Auto.</p>



<p>As Ned was hot off a popular stream of Grand Theft Auto 5 and had been vocal about the GTA 6 trailer, I was eager to ask him what he was most looking forward to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m just excited <strong>for the game</strong>. I want to play. I want to play it, I want to <em>livestream </em>it, I want to enjoy it just like everybody enjoyed our game.</p>



<p>It’s going to be awesome.</p>



<p>You know, apart from the jiggle physics, which are going to be great, because of the <strong>big asses</strong>—Solo’s going to love it because he loves those big asses!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The mic was then passed to Fonteno:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s Miami, baby! You know what I’m saying?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the same interview, the pair let me know that Young Maylay, recognizable as the voice of Carl Johnson in 2006’s GTA San Andreas, is now touring conventions with them and meeting fans, and he’s loving every second.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>I tried to get a little information from Ned and Shawn about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-actors-gta-5-leads-advice-get-ready-for-it/">the lead actors in GTA 6</a>, but they remained tight-lipped. I had to try!</p>



<p>It might have been more than 12 years since Grand Theft Auto 5 was released, but these guys are still beloved by the wider community. Let me know which GTA 5 character was your favourite on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Since May 2024, however, the studio has also been shepherding </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Rogue Prince of Persia </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">through an Steam Early Access campaign that culminated in an official launch on August 20.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, due to a variety of factors including shifting player expectations, the team had to tweak their pre-release strategy in a bid to lure in players. As a result, the studio has become more wary of early access in general.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To be honest, the way I see it now is that unless you're coming into early access with a 90 percent complete game, don't do it. Because players, they don't see it as early access, they see it a game to play," says Houghton.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He adds that players are entitled to express their views because they're often paying money to play early access titles, but he feels that sifting viewpoint means consumers are less willing to follow games on an early access journey that will often result in significant changes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/frost-giant-ceo-tim-morten-says-layoffs-are-possible-after-stormgate-underperforms" target="_self" data-discover="true">Frost Giant CEO Tim Morten says layoffs are possible after Stormgate underperforms</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eurlings echoes that point and suggests that a perceived lack of polish and content can now be a "huge issue" during early access campaigns. He explains that Evil Empire was even forced to rethink their original roadmap after the earliest versions of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Prince of Persia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> failed to meet internal expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Initially we wanted to do quick updates. Very fast. In the end, we took a bit more time to ensure that each update would be a bit more chunky," he adds, noting that pivot resulted in a steady cadence of monthly updates that each packed a fair bit of clout. That shift came after the team conceded that early access numbers "weren't great."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Houghton explains the project initially attracted just under 1,000 peak concurrent users (CCU). After they flipped the script, the title started to pull in around 4,000 CCU.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's why we wanted to prioritize chunky content—there would be an impact every time," says Houghton, before acknowledging the title still hadn't quite met the team's CCU expectations even after that switch-up.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/newsbrief-devcom-to-rebrand-as-gamescom-dev" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devcom to rebrand as Gamescom Dev</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;Of course you listen to the feedback and take the ideas [on board], but you have to feed them through a filter.&quot;">"Of course you listen to the feedback and take the ideas [on board], but you have to feed them through a filter."</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It underlines the risks that come with early access, and Houghton specifically wonders whether some developers who can't hit that 90 percent completion benchmark before launching into early access might instead be better off conducting beta tests through Steam instead.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're curious as to where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rogue Prince of Persia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was when it entered Early Access, Houghton suggests the project was roughly 60 percent complete.

I think that's become more like Early Access.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-randy-pitchford-admits-he%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98a-little-nervous%E2%80%99-about-the-more-challenging-parts-of-borderlands-4.1278552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Borderlands 4 boasts the biggest evolution of the series thus far. It’s the most ambitious game the team at Gearbox has ever created, boasting a seamless open-world map, numerous hours of exploration-based opportunities, and a core gameplay loop that facilitates endless playstyles.</p>



<p>I caught up with Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, at Gamescom, and took a deep dive into the changes that will help to differentiate Borderlands 4 from Borderlands 3. He wasn’t afraid to admit he’s nervous about one key change that will alter the game’s difficulty rating.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-borderlands-4-hard">Is Borderlands 4 Hard?</h2>



<p>I played Borderlands 4 for an hour at Gamescom and can confirm that it’s not <strong>super tough</strong>. I <em>was </em>playing on a lower difficulty level, so it’s tough to give an accurate representation of how the game will feel when you’re playing with more users to push the challenges up and running the game at a higher difficulty grade.</p>



<p>Going into my interview with Randy Pitchford, I knew that the team at Gearbox had designed some of the toughest bosses in franchise history. I was curious why and how that challenge would be felt by even the most die-hard veterans of the series.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We have lots of players that actually aren’t interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters.</p>



<p><strong>I’m a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging</strong>, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>



<p>You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass.</p>



<p>But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics.</p>

<p>Fans of the series will recognize this gameplay mechanic. If you can’t defeat an enemy, go away and level up, and you’ll do much better on your successive pass at that boss or objective.</p>



<p>In my exclusive Gamescom demo, I got to control Harlowe, one of the game’s more technical Vault Hunters, and I faced off against a fairly challenging boss, a ‘Spy Master’ of the game’s ‘Timekeeper’ big bad. It was innovative, enjoyable, and satisfying, even considering my hatred for intense challenges.</p>

                <p>The Borderlands series is well known for many things, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-co-op-aims-to-be-as-seamless-as-possible/1100-6533964/" data-ref-id="1100-6533964">emphasis on co-op</a>, unique visual style, and humor, but it is also quite famous for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">distinct player characters</a>, who often use advanced tech or psychic superpowers to lay waste to enemies. Harlowe, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>'s new playable characters, is no different, and Gearbox has finally provided some insight into how they play.</p><p>Harlowe has <em>a bunch </em>of toys at their disposal considering their past as a combat scientist for Maliwan, one of the Borderlands universe's weapons manufacturers. They seem to be particularly great at using this high-tech weaponry for crowd control, often debuffing or straight up incapacitating enemies to create advantages for themself and their team.</p><p>For example, one of Harlowe's main abilities is the Chroma Accelerator, which fires an unstable ball of energy that  drifts forward and plows through crowds, all the while dealing cryo damage to anyone it floats past. Harlowe players can also detonate it an anytime to deal radiation damage or seemingly wait for it to burst on impact. This skill can be further upgraded to bounce haphazardly between enemies, store damage overtime to be dealt when it eventually explodes, and it can even be given a greater gravitational pull.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrYNvTaFHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDrYNvTaFHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harlowe can also throw out a flux generator that emits an freezing energy field, and enemies that are caught in it are also entangled. This means that other enemies with the same debuff share weapon and skill damage dealt to them, like a chain effect. Additionally, it can gain a slew of new properties, including a greater radius, secondary area-of-effect triggers, and can even be used to simultaneously buff teammates and debuff enemies.</p><p>Harlowe's flashiest tool appears to be their Zero-Point ability, which suspends enemies in mid-air via a colorful, high-tech bubble. They can fire upon enemies trapped in them, but they can also press the action skill button again to slam these foes in whatever direction Harlowe is facing, which sounds like something I may never tire of. It can also be upgraded to provide healing to Harlowe or their teammates, attract ricocheting bullets to suspended enemies, or create a singularity and subsequent cryo explosion upon slamming an opponent in a bubble.</p><p>If you want to start planning your Harlowe builds, there is already a <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/harlowe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preview of their skill trees</a> available, but you also won't have to wait too long to play the game for yourself. After all, Borderlands 4 is releasing on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a Switch 2 port coming about a month later on October 3.</p>

			<p>If you were unaware, <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award">Gamescom</a> has its own set of awards given out at the annual event that are voted on by members of an independent jury, with the purpose of the awards being "<em>to honor outstanding games, extensions, exhibitors, booths, merch, as well as announcements and trailers</em>," per the <a href="https://media.koelnmesse.io/gamescom/redaktionell/gamescom/downloads/pdf/gamescom-award/regulations.pdf">awards regulations</a>. For <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, there was a clear winner, with Capcom and Resident Evil Requiem hogging the spotlight and being one of three games to take home multiple awards.  </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem took home wins for Best Visuals, Best Audio, the Most Epic Game, and the Best Sony PlayStation Game at this year's show. The only other titles to grab multiple awards were Hela, an indie game that won Most Entertaining and Most Wholesome, and Anno 117: Pax Romana, which won Best PC Game and Best Booth, though technically that last one goes to Ubisoft for the Anno 117: Pax Romana booth.</p>



<p>The other notable win in this year's awards was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gamescom/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> taking home the prize for Best Trailer, which was one of the few awards not voted on by the pre-selected jury, but by the general public.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">one of the wildest Intel prototypes I witnessed at CES</a> was a giant handheld gaming PC with an 11-inch autostereoscopic (read: glasses-free) 3D screen, detachable controllers, an Intel Lunar Lake chip, and a dedicated toggle to switch between 2D and 3D modes.</p><p>Co-developed by Intel and Tencent Games, it was called the Sunday Dragon 3D One and <a href="https://www.ithome.com/0/813/251.htm">dubbed an experimental product</a>. But now, Abxylute, the company best known for kickstarting <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/abxylute/abxylute-cloud-gaming-handheld-console">a $199 cloud gaming handheld</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em> that it will actually sell this massive Windows handheld as the <a href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">Abxylute 3D One</a>.</p><p>It should go on sale in late September or early October for a price under $1,700, marketing head Eunice Lu tells me.</p><p>Abxylute largely seems to be whitelabeling the product. The company’s photos look like the one I saw at CES, up to and including the model name “Sunday Dragon 3D One” printed on the back, though Lu tells me final units won’t have that branding. The company’s also upfront that it will come with Tencent’s eye-tracking 3D display, co-developed with partners Intel and display maker BOE.</p><p>It should even have a Tencent app that claims to add 3D depth to your 2D photos, videos, and games, using a real-time interleaving algorithm, though you won’t always need to rely on that: Abxylute claims the product’s specifically optimized to deliver 3D for 50 of the top Steam games, including <em>Black Myth: Wukong, Naraka Bladepoint </em>and<em> Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</p><p>One important difference since CES: it has new twin touchpads on each of its detachable grips! Those grips also have magnetic drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> that I’m currently reviewing (which recently got a graphics driver update that gives it competitive performance with other top Windows handhelds), it’ll feature Intel’s Core Ultra 258V chip and 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, powering a 120Hz 16:10 screen.</p><p>Unlike MSI’s 8-inch handheld, however, this is a huge 3-in-1 convertible: its 10.95-inch 2560 x 1600 display can lean back on a kickstand as you detach the controllers, or plug into a magnetic keyboard folio, when you’re not holding up its entire 2.45 pounds (1.11kg) between your two hands. And yet it only houses a 50 watt-hour battery, smaller than the Claw 8 or the Asus ROG Ally X. It also advertises a switchable display with 60Hz and 120Hz modes — not a variable refresh rate, which I’ve found provides smoother gameplay on handhelds like these.</p><p>Some of the screen’s specs are intentional for 3D reasons, though. Lu says “3D mode requires the display to run at 120Hz,” and it’s deliberately a large screen: “smaller panels noticeably reduce the naked-eye 3D effect, so this form factor was chosen to preserve stereoscopic quality.” Thinking back, it’s true that I’ve enjoyed glasses-free 3D screens more when they’re larger, as you can move your head more to appreciate the depth without running into a screen bezel.</p><p>Even if it’s not as portable and far pricier than the competition, I bet the Abxylute will have devotees: my colleague Antonio <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">appreciates the idea of big handhelds</a> after toying with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">the Acer Nitro Blaze 11</a>, a handheld the same size and shape as this!</p><p>And it’s also possible creators looking for a glasses-free 3D device will buy one with no intention of gaming: the screens can be handy to preview 3D models and artistry, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24036574/leia-glasses-free-3d-ces-2024">laptops and standalone screens with the tech also exist</a>.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/abxylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld#comments">5<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/763957/axbylute-will-actually-sell-intel-and-tencents-gigantic-glasses-free-3d-handheld]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-bubsy-game-actually-looks-awesome-seriously.1278528/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When, earlier this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> kicked off with the reveal of a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-first-five-minutes-of-bubsy-is-all-the-bubsy-we-nee-1749075286"><em>Bubsy</em></a> game, many online, myself included, went “Oh no…” as we shook our collective heads. But despite the last few <em>Bubsy</em> games being bad, it seems this new one,<em> Bubsy 4D</em>, might actually be…good? In fact, it might even be awesome. Really. Seriously.</p> <p>Back in the early ’90s, Bubsy starred in a handful of fairly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubsy#History">well-received 2D platformers</a>. But then in 1996, the <em>Bubsy</em> series made the leap to 3D, and everything went south. People hated <em>Bubsy 3D</em> and to this day, it is still called one of the worst platformers ever made. Then, in the last decade, we started getting new <em>Bubsy</em> games. They were also bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/PecXsy5-0yw"><em>Really</em> bad.</a> But now, a few years after Atari bought the franchise, <em>Bubsy 4D</em> is here, and it just might turn things around for the hopping feline.</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is being made by <a href="https://www.fabraz.com/">Fabraz</a>, a renowned indie studio that has made a name for itself developing fun, innovative, and colorful 3D and 2D platformers that feel amazing to play, like <em>Demon Turf</em> and <em>Slime San</em>. And since announcing the game earlier this week at Gamescom, the studio has started releasing gameplay of <em>Bubsy 4D</em>, and it looks wonderful!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because a lot of people were curious: Here's me playing the same Bubsy 4D level without trying speedrun it. <a href="https://t.co/Xcm6mygpS8">pic.twitter.com/Xcm6mygpS8</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958646093031366982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In new gameplay shared from the Gamescom demo, we can see <em>Bubsy 4D</em> in action, and the game looks vibrant and slick. Movement and jumping look snappy, but there’s some weight to Bubsy, so it’s not too floaty. I’m also a fan of<a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958190420598366399"> Bubsy’s personality in the videos released so far, too</a>. Another wild fact about this new <em>Bubsy</em> game: It contains fully voiced, 3D animated cutscenes.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fun fact, Bubsy 4D has fully voiced cutscenes cus' why not! <a href="https://t.co/DrL6A75f9x">pic.twitter.com/DrL6A75f9x</a></p> <p>— Fabraz: Demon Tides ➡️ Gamescom (@Fabrazz) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fabrazz/status/1958456027675795909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I can’t believe I’m saying this in the year of our lord 2025, but I’m very excited about a <em>Bubsy</em> game. Everything I’ve seen of Fabraz’s<em> Bubsy 4D</em> looks incredible. And people who have played the demo at Gamescom seem positive about how it plays and feels, which is only making me more excited for this sequel. <a href="https://x.com/Fabrazz/status/1958916894548803679">There’s also an outfit that blurs Bubsy’s private parts</a> and is a reference to Sonic. <a href="https://x.com/Fat_Bard/status/1958938923507306765">Even the game’s music sounds great!</a> So yeah, I want to play<em> Bubsy 4D</em> right now. But I can’t. Which makes me very sad. Damn you, Bubsy!</p> <p><em>Bubsy 4D</em> is set to launch on consoles and PC… eventually. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3237970/Bubsy_4D/">You can wishlist it now on Steam.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia graphics cards are getting a bit cheaper in Europe as the company has lowered the prices of a number of RTX 50-series GPUs.</p>



<p>Cut by nearly 10% in some cases, the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5070 have seen their prices drop across the region. The move comes as the Euro contains to strengthen against the United States (US) dollar.</p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-cuts-geforce-rtx-50-prices-in-europe-as-eur-strengthens-against-us-dollar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>, the top-end Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 is retailing for €2,099, a 9.88% drop from the launch price of €2,329. The next-highest card, the RTX 5080, is now 9.4% lower at €1,059. The RTX 5070 has fallen 9.24% from €649 to €589. Lastly, the low-end RTX 5050 has a smaller drop, but still a drop nonetheless, of 6.7% to €251.</p>

<p>While the prices are lower in Europe, there’s been no sign that the US will see anything similar any time soon. Due to the state of global economics, companies are looking at ways they can continue to sell products while generating revenue. In this instance, it’s more of a case of adjusting for the aforementioned strength of the Euro against the US dollar than anything else.</p>

<p>The Division 2 has revealed its Year 7 roadmap for 2025 and beyond at Gamescom. Furthermore, the next season of the title is only a few weeks away.</p>



<p>Developed by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment, The Division 2 has been going steadily since its release in 2019. Taking over for the original, the game has expanded its boundaries, both in locations like Washington, DC and in modes like the roguelike Descent. Now, the future of the multiplayer shooter has been laid out, thanks to a new update from Gamescom.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Starting off the new content for Year 7 of The Division 2 is The Pact, a new season launching September 9th, 2025. We get a glimpse of what it will be like in the trailer above. As per <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/4235uGIN3QkbDq4iNQVlT1/the-division-2-at-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a> on The Division 2’s website, The Pact focuses on the enemy factions, which have joined up. New to the season is Retaliation, a permanent open-world activity that adds Control Points mechanics.</p>



<p>After The Pact, the next season, titled Mutiny, will launch later this year. It plans on adding new modifiers, as well as a new companion mechanic. While details are scarce about Mutiny, the team promises that fans will hear more in the coming months. In the roadmap, there is mention of the franchise’s tenth-year anniversary, so there’s many reasons to look forward to that, whether it be The Division 3 or bigger expansions.</p>



<p>What do you think of the upcoming roadmap for The Division 2? Will you be joining in on The Pact and Mutiny? Let us know in the comments and on the forums!</p>
