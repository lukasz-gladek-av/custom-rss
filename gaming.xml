            <p>Xbox's Matt Booty has spoken more on the closure of Tango Gameworks earlier this year, and, while he did not name names, it appears that a change in leadership at the Hi-Fi Rush studio was a factor in Microsoft's decision.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/xbox-studios-matt-booty-podast-game-pass-fallout-studio-closures-1236038120/">Variety's Strictly Business podcast</a>, the Xbox executive was asked about the closure of Tango Gameworks, and whether Microsoft had tried to seek another buyer for the studio.</p>

</figure>
<p>"I won't get into the real sort of nitty gritty details on you know, what went into the decision, mostly out of respect for the people there, just because you know, there was a lot of work that went into delivering Hi-Fi Rush, which was a great game and you know did well for us," Booty began.</p>
<p>"I think the thing to be considered is that for us, it's as much a forward looking situation as much as it is looking back at one certain game... There are a lot of things that go into success for a game. You know, what leadership do you have? What creative leadership do you have? Is the team the same team that shipped something successful previously?</p>
<p>"And we have to look at all of those things together and then ask ourselves, are we set up for success going forward? And while there may have been factors and situations that previously led to success, they may not all still be in place as you look at what you're doing going forward."</p>
<p>Booty seemed to be referring - at least in part - to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-leaving-tango-gameworks-after-12-years">departure of Tango Gameworks founder Shinji Mikami last year</a>. Mikami established Tango Gameworks in 2010, with the studio going on to develop The Evil Within series and Ghostwire: Tokyo. Prior to this, he worked at Capcom on the Resident Evil series.</p>
<p>Booty also seemed to suggest closing down Tango Gameworks wasn't the only option Microsoft considered. He gave examples of previous Xbox-owned studios that have since gone independent, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activisions-skylanders-crash-bandicoot-studio-toys-for-bob-going-independent">Toys for Bob</a>, which now has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spyro-studio-toys-for-bob-secures-deal-with-microsoft-for-its-first-independent-game">publishing deal in place with Microsoft</a>.</p>
<p>"I think back to a studio called Twisted Pixel in Texas that we acquired and then for a sort of change in goals, it wasn't a perfect match anymore, but that studio today is still thriving," Booty continued. "We wanted to set them up for success. So we absolutely look at what the possible business options are to keep a studio open or to keep you know, perhaps have it change hands. And it's just one of the things, of course, that we look at across the board."</p>
<p>Booty closed: "Sometimes those things come together, sometimes they don't."</p>

<p>As well as Tango Gameworks, Redfall and Dishonored developer Arkane Austin and Mighty Doom studio Alpha Dog Games were also impacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft's closures in May</a>.</p>
<p>Many were quick to condemn the company's decision to shutter these studios, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">Arkane Lyon boss Dinga Bakaba calling it a "fucking gut stab"</a>.</p>

			<p>New Final Fantasy VII glitches continue to be discovered over 27 years after the game's release on the original PlayStation.</p>
<p><strong><em>(There will be some spoilers below, so avoid reading if you have never played Final Fantasy VII and don't want to get anything spoiled.)</em></strong></p>
<p>The new glitch, showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@4-8Productions">4-8 Productions</a> on YouTube, allows players to retain Aerith in the party even after the events at the Forgotten Capital. What makes this glitch fascinating is the complex procedure to activate it, which essentially requires the user to "confuse" the game so that it doesn't know exactly at what moment the story actually is, only to rectify it at the Icicle Inn location, the first location Cloud and his companions visit after the Forgotten Capital, to keep Aerith in the party.</p>
<p><iframe title="HUGE FFVII Discovery Brings Aerith Back To Life!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/May-fRmdWNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The events at the Forgotten Capital also mark the end of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second entry in the remake trilogy released earlier this year on PlayStation 5. Built on some of the mechanics introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Remake</a>, Rebirth greatly expands them, doing away with the predominant linearity of its predecessor to present one of the best JRPGs released in recent times. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <p>
FromSoftware's Soulsborne games are notoriously difficult to beat, but creator Hidetaka Miyazaki has said it would "break the game itself" to turn down the challenge.
</p>
<p>
In an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">The Guardian</a>, Miyazaki discussed how high difficulty is not only creatively part of the game, but also has led to its success.

</p>
<p>
"If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn't the right approach," he said. 
</p>
<p>
"Had we taken that approach, I don't think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy - which, in my eyes, would break the game itself."

<p>
Of course, difficulty is subjective, and Elden Ring's new expansion Shadow of the Erdtree does not add any further accessibility options to the game.
</p>
<p>
However, in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-on-originating-the-soulslike-genre">interview with Eurogamer</a>, Miyazaki said: "this is not something I'm opposed to in the slightest," adding "we're going to continue to look into it and see how we can do those features in our future titles."

</p>
<p>
Shadow of the Erdtree is released today and, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki previously told Eurogamer</a>, its difficulty is relative to the end of the base game.

</p>
<p>
"We wanted to provide these challenging encounters and these menacing threats, and in order to do that, we wanted to give the player a lot of freedom of approach," he said. "We wanted them to feel free in how they choose and when they choose to approach and tackle these hardships.
</p>
<p>
"So players who look for that sort of challenge in our games will find a challenge on equal footing in the DLC as well."
</p>
<p>
Difficulty was a key point in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review</a>.

</p>
<p>
"It's true that this distinct type of FromSoft-engineered frustration is an indispensable part of the Souls experience - to hurl yourself repeatedly against a seemingly immovable object until through sheer luck and serendipitous timing, you somehow prevail," it reads.
</p>
<p>
"There is real palpable joy and pride and relief in that - we've all felt it, and with the blessing of hindsight, suddenly all of that failure feels like it was worth it. In other cases they're genuinely instructional, with real lessons learned. This, however, feels like difficulty for difficulty's sake, turned up to eleven, perhaps because with the added expectations of a DLC having something extra-absurd to conquer even though it technically doesn't require finishing the core game."

            <p>When the makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloudpunk">Cloudpunk</a> revealed their next game would be set in the same cyberpunk city as their sci-fi delivery sim, my ears were pricked. When they showed you'd be running a noodle bar and fishing in the slums instead of flying a hovercar around, I went into full wishlisty mode. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nivalis">Nivalis</a> (named for the cyberpunk city in question) was due to come to PC some time this year. But plans have changed. If, like me, you're intrigued by the promise of a life under a neon canopy, you might have to wait. The release date has been pushed into next year. As compensation, here, the creators have put out another trailer to remind you what's coming.</p>

<p>"Nivalis will be launching in Spring 2025!" say developers Ion Lands <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1488490/view/4169851371521463458?l=english">in a Steam post</a>. "Our city has taken on a life of its own, growing and evolving in ways we are eager to share with you... Ensuring that Nivalis provides the best possible experience is our priority. Your patience and support are invaluable as we navigate through this creative journey."</p>
<p>Fair dos, I'll hang about. It's still a vague date but at least it's narrowed down to a season. And there are some things in the new trailer we haven't seen before, such as the  pixellated subway map screen, or the little robot fella asking the player if they sell lube (oo-er). But apart from that it seems like another pitch for chill times in a cool <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>. There are no more hints about the serial killer that is supposedly on the loose, as mentioned in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sumptuous-cyberpunk-life-sim-nivalis-will-have-boat-rides-and-serial-killers">previous videos</a>. We'll have to wait and see what's up with that. </p>
<p>All in all it still seems good fodder for folks seeking to resettle in a futuristic city and explore some glowing streets. I got some of that desire out of my system by wandering the sidewalks of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, of course. But something about the noisy voxels of Nivalis makes the city look even more low-life-high-tech. It helps that every car is flying, which essentially pedestrianises the entire city, hopefully making its alleyways and towers more labyrinthine and intricate. Ah, maybe I'm just yearning for that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bernband-gifs">Bernband sequel</a>. Oh well.</p>

PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant - yeah, let's circle back to the title - is described in the first sentence of its Steam bio as a "cozy" game. I entertain suspicions of cozy or cosy games, inasmuch as they are increasingly framed as a kind of antidepressant in the face of a darkening world, but that's OK, because the remaining 17 words in the sentence are: "Operate your planetary defense cannon to fend off an interplanetary invasion from the comfort of your [cozy] bunker."

<p>
To offer some quick-and-dirty characterisations, PVKK is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a>, but you get a planetary defence cannon. It is an escape room game, but you get a planetary defence cannon. On reflection, I guess a planetary defence cannon may also serve as a kind of antidepressant in the face of a darkening world - and indeed a means of further darkening it - but well, it seems a bit more cathartic than some pastel-shaded gardening sim, right? A bit more of a release?</p>
<p>You can see the cannon out the reinforced window of your bunker, a brutal Schwerer Gustav-ass weapon menacing the sunset above a rocky valley. Armed with this cannon, an unlimited supply of tea ejected by some kind of dieselpunk Star Trek replicator, and a teleradio's worth of jaunty tunes, you will shoot hostile spaceships out of the sky. Mind you, there's more to PVKK than shooting. Your bunker appears to be haunted, possibly by feelings of displaced guilt at your being the stooge of an autocratic regime, whose propaganda newsletters and broadcasts you can view on the aforesaid teleradio.
</p>
<p>
Now then, that title. Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant, hah. This is the title of a game whose developer gives nary a bean for the affordances of digital media, a developer who cares not for limited Twitter character counts, headline lengths, the demands of SEO or the constraints of touchscreen keyboards. The prefacing abbreviation should be regarded as a gesture of sheer contempt towards people who can't fit the word  Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant into their heads without plugging in some external RAM. 
</p>
<p>
Having digested that title, it's no surprise to discover that the game's interface is an inventively overwhelming MicroProsey warren of analog fixtures. To fire your planetary defence cannon you have to operate a cockpit's worth of wheels and dials and levers and switches and grid displays and light-up buttons with annotations almost too small to read. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mech-engineer">Mech Engineer</a> players will love it to the point of feeling incredibly aroused, I suspect. Perhaps it's worth being the stooge of an autocratic regime if you can be locked away in a dugout with the interface of your wildest dreams and the biggest phallic metaphor your planet's technology can provide. I mean, you seemingly have to oil and repair the dashboard between sessions! Absolute filth! 
</p>
<p>
Those who aren't so keen on MicroProsey stuff should know that you'll spend a fair bit of time exploring the bunker, which harbours secrets about the outside world. "The regime keeps you in the dark, feeding you half-truths and political euphemisms," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956040/PVKK_Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant/">Steam page</a> explains. "Look behind these deceptions to understand the real situation and navigate the demands of the different factions in your own best interest." This is where the escape room puzzles come in, of course. You'll also have to make choices during dialogue with your superiors that feed into a spread of endings. Intrigue, there is plenty.
</p>
<p>
PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant is the work of Bippinbits, who are, oh goodness, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper</a>??? It all makes sense now! It's like they're parodying their own work. I probably should have put that in the intro - I'll put it in the headline instead. The game doesn't have a release date yet.

<p data-characters="360" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the launch of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> expansion, Bandai Namco is hoping it will <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bandai-namco-expectations-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring in a lot of new <em>Elden Ring</em> players</a> and bump up the game’s already impressive sales. It’s too early to tell whether it has met the publisher’s expectations but, at the very least, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has got more people playing <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em> on Steam.</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1245620/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, there were just over 240,000 concurrent <em>Elden Ring</em> players at 9 p.m. UTC on June 20, which would’ve been an hour before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>‘s PC launch in U.S. Once the DLC was available worldwide, that number almost doubled to more than 495,000 players and, at around June 21, 2 a.m. UTC, peaked at 589,948 players.</p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="615" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">While nowhere near as high as its all-time peak player count of 953,426 concurrent players, 589,948 is still more than half that number and the best <em>Elden Ring</em> has performed on Steam in two years. There’s unfortunately no way of checking if the player counts on PlayStation and Xbox are similar but, if they are, this looks to be a very strong showing for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. What’s more, at the time of writing, <em>Elden Ring</em> has shot up to become <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s third most-played game</a> with 467,135 concurrent players. The only two games outperforming it are <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/i-played-weird-banana-game-blowing-up-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viral sensation <em>Banana</em></a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">It may seem baffling that a game that only involves clicking a banana over and over is proving more popular than a massive DLC expansion to 2022’s Game of the Year winner, but it does make some sense. For starters, <em>Banana</em> is completely free to play, not to mention much easier than <em>Elden Ring</em>. Last I checked, <em>Banana </em>doesn’t have extremely challenging boss fights. Plus, the bananas you earn from <em>Banana</em> can be sold for real money although this has invited <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/developer-behind-steam-smash-hit-banana-swears-it-isnt-a-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accusations of the game being a scam of some kind</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="false">Hopefully, Bandai Namco won’t be too bothered that a basic clicker game has more players than <em>Elden Ring</em> on PC. Although it’s not as if <em>Elden Ring</em> needs to be more successful; even before the DLC launched, it had sold over 25 million copies worldwide according to the <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1800891340374642989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FromSoftware Twitter account</a>. Despite such sales, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is intended to be the only DLC expansion for the game, meaning FromSoftware’s next project will be something else entirely… though I’m sure <em>Elden Ring 2</em> will happen eventually.</p>

        <p>But draws the line at generating art and voicework.</p>

            <p>Zenless Zone Zero producer Zhenyu Li revealed in a recent interview with Eurogamer (via an interpreter) that AI generated content is used in the game "program-wise" to "better smoothen the game progress."</p>
<p>No specific programming examples were provided, as Li is "not a tech person," but he did stress that AI "only consists of a small part of the programming [in Zenless Zone Zero], mostly to help the programming team to smoothen the production process, to actually make our work more efficient."</p>
<p>Something we do know is that the game's signature vibrant, urban art style that sets it apart from miHoYo's other titles, Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail, is not something made with AI generation. Li says the team wants to "create something from our own mind" when it comes to art related content, and in a later statement provided to Eurogamer to clarify some comments, it was added that this is "something the whole team believes in."</p>

</figure>
<p>In regards to voicework, while miHoYo has used an AI called Anti-Entropy in the past for their Lumi_N0va virtual avatar (and to replace a voice actor for one event in their romance mystery, Tears of Themis, when the they were unavailable), Zenless Zone Zero continues the developer's streak of employing stellar voice actors across multiple languages in their big releases, as we were given a pretty definitive "No" from Li after asking if AI technology was used to generate voices in the game.</p>
<p>Apart from the Anti-Entropy AI, we know that miHoYo also uses Nvidia’s Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) generative tech, as was revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January of this year. ACE is an AI-powered tech that helps with generating facial animations and text-to-speech inputs to assist in the creation of characters.</p>
<p>Although not confirmed, this sounds very similar to the tech Star Rail's development team are using. They <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-honkai-star-rail-is-using-ai-technology-to-supplement-development">revealed to IGN last year</a> they use AI to improve the facial appearance and behavioural patterns of characters in the game, while also mentioning their team "is paying much attention to AI, especially its impact on the gaming industry."</p>
<p>This ACE AI also makes sense as something that might "smoothen the game progress" of Zenless Zone Zero, but without a specific example provided by Li, we don't know for sure if this specific tech was used.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62% of studios reportedly already use AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ai-is-changing-video-game-development-forever">AI is changing video game development forever</a>, from Li's comments it sounds like Zenless Zone Zero is continuing miHoYo's trend of only lightly dipping its toes into the controversial tech, for now.</p>

The news comes as part of the controversial (more on this in a bit) company’s digital LRG3 event. You can watch the full thing <a href="https://youtu.be/0G3umAZ-nvM">here</a>, and the Fear Effect trailer below.</p>

<p>If you’ve not played Fear Effect, you’d be forgiven for assuming from the trailer that it’s a standard fixed-camera action game. But its real beauty lies in influence from both survival horror and cinematic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platform games</a> like<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/another-world"> Another World</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/flashback">Flashback</a>. As you switch between characters in your gang of ne’er-do-wells at set story moments, solving puzzles and combat encounters, new screens offer up insta-death setpieces that need to be carefully considered then perfected. Fail, and you'll often be treated to one of the game's <a href="https://youtu.be/tr_btcSxMP0">dozens of unique death animations.</a></p>
<p>As a consequence of said death scenes and many others, Fear Effect came on four discs. I distinctly remember starting a lending chain with two of my mates where one would complete one disc then lend it on to the next. This was logistically irritating but I did not mind. I simply wished more people to play Fear Effect, altruistic videogame paragon that I am. I cannot take full public responsibility for the game coming to Steam, although I can write *wink wink* and let you decide who the <em>real </em>hero is here (disclosure: I had nothing to do with it.) The closest thing we’ve had to the series on PC for many years now is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear-effect-sedna">Fear Effect Sedna</a>, which emulates very little of what was good about Fear Effect and its sequel, Retro Helix.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the LRG3 showcase, we got trailers for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil">Beyond Good &amp; Evil</a> - 20th Anniversary Edition (<a href="https://youtu.be/CaU4tMuvvdc">25th June</a>!), a new edition of <a href="https://youtu.be/PA2GwYOIqCw">Fighting Force</a> (Fighting Force!), and a <a href="https://youtu.be/ixbqTAPCApQ">new trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clock-tower">Clock Tower: Rewind</a>, alongside several others.</p>
<p>Before you throw any money at Limited Games, though, it’s worth highlighting some recent controversy around the company, who primarily offer special edition re-releases of older or indie games. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/limited-run-games-apologizes-for-cd-r-discs-after-fan-outcry-says-its-working-on-pressed-disc-solution">they apologised</a> for shipping faulty CD-R’s of the 3DO game D. The company has also been criticised for creating somewhat of a for-profit walled garden, <a href="https://x.com/ellaguro/status/1404540426485485568">antithetical to game preservation through promoting scarcity</a>, alongside various other quality control issues. However, it’s also worth noting that a lot of bad blood against the company has been drummed up by right wingers unhappy with them for <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1611492929331240961">letting go of a social media manager</a> accused of transphobia last year.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, we learned from the official franchise Twitter/X account that Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy has now sold through over 20 million units.</p>
<p>Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy is a collection of remasters of classic platformers, originally released in 2017 for PlayStation 4 and the following year on PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. It was developed by Vicarious Visions (now known as Blizzard Albany following <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-bandicoot-tony-hawk-vicarious-visions-no-more-blizzard-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an internal reorganization</a> within Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>When the game launched on PS4, Kai Powell <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> the game for Wccftech, awarding it an 8.9/10 score.</p>
<p><em>What else can I say? It looks great, it sounds great and plays great, when you’re not getting ready to throw your controller in frustration from falling off that bridge one last time. All in all, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is one of the best remasters I’ve played in a long while and is a must-play for anyone who wants to take a trip back to their childhood. It also <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-ceo-seeing-real-passion-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looks like</a>&nbsp;this is just the beginning for Crash...</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Crash Bandicoot received a brand new installment called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It's About Time</a> in 2020. Developed by Toys for Bob, it was well-received but did not sell as much as Activision Blizzard hoped, which is why we didn't get a direct sequel. Toys for Bob released the spin-off multiplayer action game <a href="https://wccftech.com/crash-team-rumble-is-all-about-taking-platforming-into-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crash Team Rumble</a>, but that didn't make a splash, either.</p>
<p>The developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/toys-for-bobs-first-independent-game-will-still-be-with-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now gone independent</a>, but it made a deal with Microsoft to publish their first game. As such, it could have access to the Crash Bandicoot (or Spyro) IP, if Microsoft wants them to make another entry. Otherwise, it'll likely be a brand new intellectual property.</p>

<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Activision has followed the patch of <em>Fortnite</em> in recent years, teaming up with other gaming franchises to bring their skins to <em>Call of Duty</em>. On June 20, <em>Warzone</em> and <em>MW3</em> received a set of four <em>Fallout</em>-themed Operator outfits, which fans have labeled “low effort.”</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">With Microsoft now the owner of both Bethesda and Activision, it was only a matter of time before we saw links form between the two. That’s come in the form of the four Operator skins, featuring <em>Modern Warfare</em> characters Price, Ghost, Soap, and Gaz. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">The cosmetics see the four characters dressed in the classic Vault Dweller outfits, the blue and gold jumpsuit that will be instantly recognizable to anyone who’s played the game or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/first-fallout-reviews-say-its-one-of-the-best-game-adaptations-ever-made/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">watched the Amazon series</a>. The drop hasn’t gone down well with fans though, who have criticized the lack of creativity. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Fans are not impressed. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true">“Talk about low effort. They just copy-pasted the heads of the four main cast onto basically four identical bodies,” wrote punchrockchest on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1dkgzvt/fallout_bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. “First, using the main cast was a bad call. Second, having the heads in their full military appearance and then blue pajamas isn’t a great look. Third, why not have someone from the <em>Fallout</em> show or game? Fourth, why have only the Vault suits? There are tons of iconic suits and characters used rather than four identical outfits.”</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">Kastles1 agreed, stating: “I was going to say the licensing deal probably caused it to be like this and then I thought about it and technically the same company that owns <em>Call of Duty</em> owns <em>Fallout</em>. No reason why we couldn’t get something better than what we got.”</p> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">Steampunk22 was particularly frustrated, asking: “How can anyone in good conscience support this game? This is embarrassingly low effort,” while DayDreamerJon called them “terrible and low effort,” asking why there were no Ghoul, Super Mutant, or Power Armor skins.</p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">While this set is disappointing to some, there is a chance that this is just the beginning, and we’ll get more <em>Fallout</em>-themed cosmetics further down the road. For now, though, players are not impressed, and I doubt many will be giving up the Nuka Cola Caps for this set.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has finally confirmed the release date for Beyond Good and Evil 20th Anniversary Edition. First <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-remaster-2024-game-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>by Ubisoft in late 2023, the game will debut on June 25 for PlayStation 5 &amp; PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S|X, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Luna and PC through the Ubisoft Store, Epic Games Store and Steam. Limited Run Games is also producing a physical edition and a Collector's Edition, with pre-orders set to open on July 12.</p>
<p>The project was developed by Virtuos Games under the supervision of Ubisoft Montpellier, the current franchise steward. While not a full remaster, it will offer several improvements, as detailed in the official overview.</p>
<p><em>Players will be able to (re)discover the pioneering Action-Adventure game by exploring the wonderfully odd maritime world of Hillys in the best way possible with improved performances up to 4k, 60fps and numerous qualities of life improvements including autosave, cutscene-skip, full controller and keyboard &amp; mouse support, and cross-save across all platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>Alongside these updates, Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition will also introduce a new Speedrun Mode to challenge players, 20+ new achievements and an Anniversary Gallery delving deep into the game’s development history and featuring tons of never-before-seen artworks, videos and so much more.</em></p>
<p><em>Finally, this special edition will feature hunt in which players can discover more about Jade’s past and collect exclusive cosmetic rewards. This exclusive new mission also reveals more about the narrative link to Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2, showing Ubisoft’s enduring commitment to the franchise.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaU4tMuvvdc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That final tidbit is interesting. The release of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition would indeed look like Ubisoft is investing in the franchise. However, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is one of the most delayed games of all time at this point. The prequel was originally announced in 2008, then scrapped, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resurfaced</a> in 2017 before going dark again. In September 2020, creator Michel Ancel <a href="https://wccftech.com/michel-ancel-retires-from-the-industry-wild-and-beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">retired</a> from the industry, and the project took another hit in July 2023 when creative director Emile More died suddenly at the age of 40.</p>
<p>In August 2022, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game was still several years away from release, and it was once again a no-show at the Ubisoft Forward showcase earlier this month.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Erdtree is here and it’s already doing bits for Elden Ring’s player count. On Steam, the peak concurrent player count in the last 24 hours sat at a whopping 589,948 users – a week ago, that was 174,000 concurrent users, and a few months back, it sat at around 35,000 players. That’s indicative of the game’s performance across all platforms, as Shadow of the Erdtree has now been released and is already cementing itself as one of the greatest expansions of all time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-numbers">High Numbers</h2>



<p>Elden Ring’s all-time high player count on Steam sits at a staggering 953,426, and that was secured just after the game was released in February 2022. On the popular PC platform, Elden Ring has remained relatively consistent since it dropped, sitting around the top of the table and never falling below a peak concurrent count of 30,000 in a month. That’s huge staying power for any game – and it’s one of the reasons why Elden Ring has 93% positive reviews on Steam.</p>



<p>Shadow of the Erdtree is out today on all platforms, and players are <strong>excited</strong>. It’s a super-sized DLC with a premium price point of $39.99, but it’s worth the investment considering all that the expansion offers. However, some fans have expressed their disappointment in one aspect: Shadow of the Erdtree doesn’t have any new achievements or trophies. It’s a small thing that won’t detract from the overall quality of the expansion, but it seems like an oversight given the size of the DLC.</p>

<p>Shadow of the Erdtree, the massive and highly anticipated expansion for Elden Ring, is being released today. However, it has been noted that the super-sized DLC doesn’t have any new trophies or achievements for players to unlock. That’s par for the course with FromSoft games, but it’s still a disappointment to those gamers who seek the extra challenge of ticking those collector-based boxes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally-here">Finally Here</h2>



<p>It has been more than two years since Elden Ring was released to an overwhelmingly positive reception, stunning gamers worldwide. For the longest time, FromSoftware has been cooking on Shadow of the Erdtree, one of the most eagerly anticipated DLCs to emerge in recent years for <strong>any </strong>game. It’s a whopping investment at $39.99, but Elden Ring fans will tell you that it’s more than worth the money.</p>



<p>However, the expansion – which is around 16 GB in size – will feature plenty of content but nothing in the way of new PlayStation Trophies or Xbox Achievements. That’s a hit for those who play games <strong>specifically to unlock </strong>these rewards that many class as outdated or unnecessary. To each his own, right?</p>



<p>Are you particularly bothered by the fact that there are no new achievements or trophies for Shadow of the Erdtree? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

			<p>Zenimax, Bethesda's parent company, has seemingly filed a new trademark application for a new Id-tech powered IP "Motor".</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1803829839259914584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotted</a> by @Bogorad222 on X, the <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/986/07/motor-powered-by-98607273.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new trademark application</a> was filed some days ago on June 18. As most of you will know, id-Tech is id Software's proprietary game engine with the studio reportedly recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/id-software-id-tech-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having shifted</a> to id-Tech 8. 2020's amazing <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doom Eternal</a> runs on id Sofware's Id-tech 7. No further details about the new "Motor" trademark have been shared just yet, but fans have already been speculating that the trademark might very well be related to a new Rage entry. Of course, it could also be related to a new id-Tech spin-off engine. We've included a screenshot of the trademark application below:</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/motor-bethesda-id-tech-id-software.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft and Bethesda officially announced Doom: The Dark Ages, and it will be interesting to learn which version of id Software's engine this new Doom will use.</p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is coming to Xbox, PlayStation 5, and PC sometime next year. We've included the action-packed announcement trailer alongside some additional details about the game below:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Enter the Realm of the Gods, Kings, and the Slayer -&nbsp;</strong>The Doom Slayer stares down the viewer, lit by flames in the background. Wage war as one man matched against Hell’s legions in a dark fantasy setting expanding the Doom universe. Witness the origin of the Slayer’s rage and his rise from a kingdom’s last hope to Hell’s greatest fear in this pulse-pounding, cinematic prequel to Doom (2016) and Doom Eternal.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Face the hordes with Shield Saw and Flail in hand - A</strong>&nbsp;village is besieged by demonic forces as artillery streaks across the night sky. Blast, bludgeon, bisect and break through the enemy ranks using the Slayer’s superhuman strength, lethal arsenal and unmet tenacity. Supplement your trusty Super Shotgun with The Dark Ages’ new weaponry, including the face-shattering Flail and revved-up, throwable Shield Saw. Inspired by the original 1993 Doom, players overcome the odds in The Dark Ages in firmly grounded, heavy-hitting clashes featuring destructible demons, vicious melee strikes and more. With the right combination of ranged bombardment &amp; melee aggression, anyone stepping into the Slayer’s boots will make Hell quiver in theirs.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Command colossal machines and winged beasts -&nbsp;</strong>The building-sized Atlan mech imposes from above. DOOM: The Dark Ages’ cosmic-scale conflict calls for the heaviest ordnance possible, and the Slayer heeds. Enter the cockpit of your Atlan - a daunting skyscraper-sized mech capable of toppling Hell’s behemoths with titanic metal fists - and reclaim the skies aboard the Slayer’s Mecha Dragon, strapped to the jaws with massive jet engines and overwhelming firepower.</em></li>

<p>We live in a fallen world. Like the barbarians of old, we trample thoughtlessly across the remnants of a once-mighty empire. Perhaps we deserve our benighted existence — perhaps it has been rendered unto us by the spiteful gods. Regardless, we are deprived of the splendor known by those who came before us. We roll around in the dirt with our Steam Decks and our live games, believing ourselves to be kings. Yet the commoner of yesteryear led an existence beyond what our feeble minds could imagine. Ten years ago we had Streetpass, Download Play, and Pictochat. Now we have no streets, no play, and no chat.</p>



<p>We used to throw LAN parties in this country. We used to pile our computers into someone’s living room and promise their mom that we’d be careful around the china cabinet during an all-night <em>Unreal </em>marathon. We didn’t connect to a game’s servers or wait to download updates. We installed spawn copies of <em>Starcraft </em>on everyone’s machines and had direct, wired connections. We did this and it was good, though not without its flaws.</p>



<figure></figure>

<p>We were not content to stagnate. We sought to throw off the tyranny of cables: CAT5 cables, Game Boy link cables, coaxial cables. They strangled us, kept us grounded when we knew we were capable of soaring through the skies. Freed of these tethers, we would communicate through the air itself.</p>



<p>Enter the Nintendo DS in 2004, a mutant of a handheld device whose bizarre design led some at the time to call into question Nintendo’s sanity. It seemingly included every gimmick possible at the time, from dual touch screens to a microphone. But more important than those showy features was the handheld’s communication capabilities. The DS was able to communicate with others of its kind wirelessly, an innovation that single handedly allowed the game convention bean bag handheld lounge to come into existence.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It would have been enough to have been able to conduct <em>Pokemon </em>battles without having to be sitting inches away from your opponent. But the DS took things a step further. The Download Play feature allowed players to actually share their games. Your pal wants to play <em>Mario Kart DS </em>but you don’t have a copy? No problem, just connect to their DS — sure, you can only be Shy Guy, but you’re still playing. Download Play, then, was something of an evolution of the traditional concept of console multiplayer in which only one player had to own the title, while also functioning as a kind of trial experience of the game. Dozens of games used this feature, including high profile titles like <em>Tetris DS</em>, <em>Mario Party DS</em>, <em>Advance Wars: Dual Strike</em>, <em>New Super Mario Bros.</em>, and <em>Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!</em></p>



<p>Some games used the wireless features of the DS in more subtle ways. <em>The World Ends With You</em>, for instance, allowed for communication while the handheld was closed (in “sleep mode”). Passing by another player with the game in their DS would grant a bonus of experience points. In 2011, the 3DS iterated on the concept of encouraging passing connections between players with the introduction of Streetpass.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Oh, blessed Streetpass! Oh ye pinnacle of social game design! The 3DS could transmit its user’s Mii and basic information to other systems it passed by on the street in the course of day-to-day life. Upon checking the system, the user would be greeted with a bright green LED to indicate that they’d made such a contact, then could personally greet each Mii they’d encountered on their journeys. These Miis could also assist the player in purpose-built minigames, such as completing jigsaw puzzles of 3DS titles, growing a garden, or exploring a haunted house. 3DS games were also able to use Streetpass for their own distinct mechanics. Players could meet and recruit one another’s avatars in <em>Fire Emblem Awakening</em>, or try to beat each other’s records on courses in <em>New Super Mario Bros. 2.</em></p>



<p>Designed for the dense urban environment of Japan, Streetpass was less useful in the sprawling wilds of the United States. But each connection, each passing contact, was a beautiful thing, a reminder that those around us have names, faces, and dreams. Conventions, meanwhile, became Streetpass bonanzas, flooding 3DS owners with a deluge of visitors from around the world. This was cutting-edge technology in service of whimsy and delight, and as an experience it was so compelling that many still carry their 3DS handhelds with them to gaming events over a decade later.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Monster Hunter Freedom Unite</em></p>



<p>But it wasn’t just Nintendo that was playing around with the new experiences that local wireless devices were making possible. We hunted the (fire-breathing, half-lizard) mammoth in <em>Monster Hunter </em>titles on the PSP and Vita, playing these games the way they were meant to be played, with other people. And smartphones began to become commonplace, games like <em>Spaceteam </em>took advantage of their features, allowing for chaotic local multiplayer dynamics to emerge.</p>



<p>When Nintendo announced the Switch, a hybrid console/handheld, it wasn’t unreasonable to expect that the features pioneered by the DS family would again be improved upon and incorporated into the new hardware. And yet… and yet. Streetpass is dead. Download Play is a thing of the past. The Switch Lite, one of the most perfect handheld devices ever forged by man, pales in comparison to its dual screened predecessors when it comes to local multiplayer. Sure, we can play <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate </em>online, but at what cost?</p>



<p>Why have we turned away from the light of local multiplayer and the beauty of fleeting social gaming connections in an era when more people than ever own devices capable of wifi and Bluetooth communication? Perhaps we are afraid of the world we have created, a world where our perpetual connection to our devices no longer represents myriad opportunities for play but rather an avenue for harassment and criminality. When the DS launched with the Pictochat feature that allowed nearby users to chat by writing or drawing with the stylus and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orpgUPNSRPI">tabloid news outlets warned that it could be used by child predators</a> to lure in children, perhaps even while driving alongside them on the highway, we all laughed. Well, in our present-day reality of revenge porn, location-based stalking, and countless other excesses and misuses of communications technologies, perhaps we aren’t laughing quite so much anymore.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>A pedophile could communicate with your child while driving alongside your vehicle on the highway using the Nintendo DS’s “Pictochat” feature. This is what we were worried about in 2007.</em></p>



<p>Maybe we don’t want to be connected to those around us. The pandemic didn’t help, to be certain, but the trend away from the developments of the early 2010s started long before it hit. The Streetpass LED on the 3DS, an early form of notification, was a joyful signal. Today, we’re bombarded with notifications and alerts, and many of us have grown weary of them. In theory, modern smartphones could support apps with Streetpass-like features, and location-based dating apps are somewhat similar. But that experience of delight at connecting with another player likely wouldn’t be there because of how ubiquitous the hardware has become.</p>



<p>Dedicated handhelds from major games companies are now more or less dead anyway. The failure of the Vita took Sony out of contention in the field. The Steam Deck is a little too bulky to be considered a proper handheld, and as essentially a portable computer, it doesn’t support ad hoc wireless play. Meanwhile, the Switch continues to occupy a strange position straddling console and traditional handheld.</p>



<p>Maybe Streetpass, Download Play, and the other local multiplayer features of the DS family were always doomed to disappear into obscurity like the dual-screened design of the consoles themselves. Or maybe the dream was always, like past President of Nintendo Hiroshi Yamauchi once suggested, of people who play RPGs, to sit depressed and alone in our dark rooms. We have Discord and voice chat now, and perhaps that’s enough.</p>



<p>Or maybe it isn’t. When my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LAN-Party-Inside-Multiplayer-Revolution/dp/0500026955/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Qo37m&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063%3Aamzn1.symc.e5c80209-769f-4ade-a325-2eaec14b8e0e&amp;pf_rd_p=35cab78c-35e3-4fc1-aab0-27eaa6c86063&amp;pf_rd_r=7MCWN9YAVVE81KH33VDS&amp;pd_rd_wg=5XaOX&amp;pd_rd_r=7c7cf918-4ce7-4bc2-86fa-4f46dd2b146a&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m"><em>LAN Party</em></a><em> </em>was published earlier this year, I was struck not just by how many people had fond memories of participating in them, but by how many younger people expressed a desire that they could have been around for the era of their heyday. I don’t think this is an uncommon phenomenon — many people are fascinated by the period just before or after they were born, which is one reason for the continued influence of the 1980s in American pop culture — but it seems to speak to a longing for connection among younger people. In this sense, the handheld technologies of the early 2010s were a kind of successor to LAN parties. Software like Pictochat encouraged just hanging out and messing around, while Download Play continued the tradition of PC multiplayer games allowing for installations on multiple machines.</p>



<p>As both millennials who grew up with the internet and watched it transform and zoomers who have only ever known it in its current, centralized and corporatized mode are beginning to reevaluate their relationships to personal technologies, perhaps now is the time to rediscover what has been lost. A renewed interest in retro games has led to the boom of handheld devices running Android and Linux, typically used as emulation machines. And as hobbyist development takes over where corporate interest has declined, these devices can now even be used to play old 8- and 16-bit games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrUac9TIrWo">over ad-hoc connections</a> without wifi. We are rediscovering the old ways. Are we going to go back to sitting around drawing dicks in our local wireless chat rooms anytime soon? Probably not. But it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if we did.</p>

<h2>Together we shine</h2>



<p>There’s no bigger act of camaraderie than standing together against impossible odds. Melinoë’s odyssey in <em>Hades II</em> is a living reminder of this sentiment, with peers tagging alongside her to show support, even for a short moment, as she repeatedly plunges through the Underworld’s depths. In a way, witnessing these attempts is a parallel to the experience of playing in Early Access, sharing my feats and frustrations with others. Despite knowing that Melinoë, and us, are currently unable to succeed in her mission, we still choose to support each other.</p>



<p>The queen of the Underworld is tasked with the rescue of her own family, as well as killing the culprit, Chronos, the representation of time itself who’s easily in the top 3 of shitty grandfathers. Her aunts and uncles provide aid in the form of boons, as they did with her brother Zagreus in the first game, granting the occasional ability or buff. But they’re still a <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2020/09/01/hades/">dysfunctional bunch</a> who are yet to learn how to get along. Words of encouragement are often backhanded. Half of the conversations include snark against a fellow relative. It doesn’t take long to realize a pat on the back from Zeus or Poseidon is merely wishful thinking.</p>



<p>Receiving boons is helpful enough in the mechanical sense. Melinoë becomes stronger, more resilient, and damage numbers go up in bright colors. Yet, your interactions with most gods are fleeting. Chances are that, once you’re further enough into a run, you might not even get a conversation blurb when you pick up a boon altogether. Thankfully, there are others who offer actual companionship, showcasing a willingness to experience what Melinoë does from up close.</p>



<p>In <em>Hades</em>, Zagreus can sometimes encounter Thanatos, the personification of death, upon entering a room. Such moments play out as a competition amongst very good friends where you have to take down more enemies than him within a set time. It’s one of the many clever ways in which developer Supergiant Games adds variety to the roguelite structure, while pushing the narrative a bit further each time.</p>







<p>The sequel doubles down on these occasional encounters with characters during runs. Familiar faces like Artemis and new ones like Nemesis, Icarus, and Heracles can appear at random, each with a different behavior. Artemis and Icarus use ranged attacks to weaken or take down enemies as Melinoë fights on the ground. Once the dust settles, they show up to offer a boon or special ability, as well as a friendly conversation afterward. Heracles is closer to Thanatos from a gameplay perspective, forcing a brawl to see who gets to defeat more foes before time runs out. In a way, it’s how he gets to know Melinoë, acting hostile at first before progressively letting his guard down to see her as a peer, not an adversary.</p>



<p>Nemesis, then, is a curious case, as one could argue she encapsulates all of the above, but in a far more erratic manner. She’s prone to offer a competition to defeat enemies, too, while sometimes taking care of an entire room before your arrival instead. When she’s not offering you to trade items in exchange for gold, a boon in your possession, or a percentage of your health, she’s grabbing items at merchant shops and opening doors at her will, robbing you of the choice before you can react.</p>



<p>Despite her antagonistic demeanor, Nemesis also lets her guard down. You can reject her trade offers to avoid penalties or exchanges you’d rather pass on. One time, despite finishing an enemy encounter before I could get to the area, she still gave away an item as compensation. <em>Hades II</em> continues to be a single player game, but Nemesis’ actions create the illusion that she’s simultaneously attempting to kill Chronos, occasionally bumping into Melinoë. These moments play out organically, leading to an illusion that’s easy to believe in.</p>



<p>Such instances, far from being mere elements of surprise, capitalize on the sense of camaraderie that the sequel reinforces. Zagreus received the help of many, but his journey, and task, were more solitary in nature. In <em>Hades II</em>, there’s a common enemy. It’s always comforting to be reminded that Melinoë is not alone in her attempts to beat Chronos when a familiar face shows up to offer aid, in whichever way they know how.</p>







<p>The mutual support isn’t unbeknownst to me, as someone who’s spent over 34 hours playing <em>Hades II</em> since a few days before the Early Access launch. During that time, I’ve been sharing my experience with a few friends and peers via Discord, slowly uncovering everything that Supergiant added in the sequel. It’s gotten to a point where there’s almost a newfound chat etiquette to avoid spoilers — using vague emojis or asking subtle questions like “Have you met S?” — or interrupting a conversation to update the other person of the current progress, such as typing down “sirens brb” when reaching the end of Oceanus, the second area of the Underworld.</p>



<p>It’s interesting to see how some of these interactions are happening with folks I don’t usually talk very often. <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a similar case for me, in which I’d either help a friend during their first few missions or another would unexpectedly join my session for a couple of hours before storming off. Much like my DMs about <em>Hades II</em>, there’s no need for a long catch-up beforehand. We just get straight into the matter at hand, providing guidance or just commiserating about our attempts.</p>



<p>The key difference is that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was originally designed as a co-op experience that encourages you to band together with others. <em>Hades II</em> is not. Instead, the roguelite sparks its communal camaraderie thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hades/playing-hades-2-in-early-access-is-the-best-way-to-experience-supergiants-evolving-roguelike/">Early Access</a>. The model’s structure, which was already the subject of Supergiant’s narrative-driven touch for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-early-access-journey-has-been-more-important-than-the-destination">first game</a>, is thematically mirroring the protagonist’s journey once more.</p>



<p>Being able to actually finish a run in <em>Hades</em> once the 1.0 launch happened, after dozens of successful attempts prior that didn’t result in an actual victory, gave me an unmatched catharsis that I wouldn’t have had otherwise. The sequel is already on a similar path, albeit with a greater feeling already brewing in place. A <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-steam-player-count-performance-pc-1851460841">lot more people</a> are playing in Early Access this time around — an unsurprising fact considering its predecessor’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-hades-i-has-sold-over-1-million-copies-in-under-two-years">resounding success</a> — and sharing their feats and frustrations with one another.</p>



<p>Only time will tell how the story goes for Melinoë, and how Supergiant tries to surprise again. Much like the queen of the Underworld, it’s comforting knowing I’m not alone in my attempts to defeat Chronos, despite the impossible odds. Both familiar and new faces are lending me their support, strengthening our bonds in the process as we take part in a fleeting experience that, one day, will never be the same. Despite only being in Early Access for a few weeks, I can safely say that this newfound sense of camaraderie is teaching me th- wait, sirens, brb.</p>

He explains he isn’t interested in leaving his own mark on many previous FromSoftware IP because series like Kings Field and Enchanted Arms are too connected to the work of other developers.</p><p>“I think a lot of these games are so intertwined with the directors who almost invented that style of game,” he said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms.</p></div><p>Miyazaki continued: “I don’t think there’s a scenario where I myself would make a King’s Field. The same can be said about Otogi and Enchanted Arms."</p><p>The one exception to this rule is the Armored Core series. Miyazaki served as a planner on Armored Core: Last Raven and chipped in for other games in the franchise, too. As a result, he feels equipped to potentially return to that universe.</p><p>"I worked on Armored Core 4 and Armored Core: For Answer," he added. "It enabled me to put my own interpretation on Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon and develop that.”</p><p>We'll have to wait to see if Miyazaki's vision for a traditional JRPG comes to fruition. Meanwhile, FromSoftware is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-release-times">beginning to roll out substantial Elden Ring DLC in the form of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. While the studio’s next project remains a mystery, the FromSoftware boss recently revealed that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-still-isnt-the-ideal-fantasy-rpg-in-the-eyes-of-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazaki"><u>the world he co-created with George R.R. Martin isn’t quite his idea of an “ideal fantasy RPG.”</u></a></p><p>"While Elden Ring is not quite it, it's pretty close,” he said at the time. “It's getting close."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For more, be sure to read up on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-may-consider-beginning-to-end-total-co-op-in-future-fromsoftware-games"><u>how the team might introduce new co-op elements to future titles</u></a>. You can also read <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-interview"><u>our interview with Miyazaki</u></a>, where we learned more about the world of Elden Ring and how the DLC expands on an already fantastic formula.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-dubbing-challenge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday Ubisoft, a company worth <em>billions</em>, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/5JEWsSKwGmJDmlvvM12PpN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>a competition where a fan could win the chance to provide the voice of a non-player character (NPC) in the upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. They would not be paid for their services.</p><p>In 2018, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2s-plan-to-crowdsource-art-from-fa-1826783550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked fans</a> to provide art and music for the seemingly-doomed <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, with only the promise of <em>possible </em>payment.</p><p>In 2019, Ubisoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-invites-fans-to-make-music-for-watch-dogs-legi-1836389136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked fans</a> to provide some music for <em>Watch Dogs 3</em>, only it was under the guise of '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_work#:~:text=Speculative%20work%2C%20also%20known%20as,been%20agreed%20upon%20in%20writing." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spec work</a>', which again carried with it only the possibility of a decent payment relative to the services provided. </p><p>All three decisions were roundly criticised by fans and professionals alike, for fairly obvious reasons. If you want someone to do work for you, pay them!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb-ssd-fire-sale-available-for-only-299/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intel's Optane SSDs were one of a kind, using 3DXPoint instead of NAND for storage. They had many advantages over traditional SSDs, amongst which include unusually high endurance ratings and extremely low latency. Even today, Optane SSDs like the 905p provide faster loading times than the best PCI-e 4 and PCI-e 5 SSDs on the market.</p>
<p>One of the biggest reasons that Optane failed to catch on with enthusiasts was the price. When the 905p was initially released, the 1.5tb model sold for a jaw-dropping $2,199.99 - a price higher than the fastest consumer GPUs on the market!</p>
<p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Optane-Loading-Times.webp"></a>I recently benchmarked Intel's Optane P5800X and 905p drives in Final Fantasy while paired with an Intel i9-14900K. The "old" Optane 905p still leads over NAND SSDs, beating Kingston's Fury Renegade by 2.27 seconds. Now let's be real - that's not a huge amount of time saved. But when you look at it from a performance perspective, that's an impressive 46% faster than the Fury Renegade's 7.19 seconds.</p>
<p>Optane's production has been discontinued, and as a result prices of the remaining units on the market drop every day. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=jb4H9BKWZ98&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https://www.newegg.com/intel-optane-905p-1-5tb/p/N82E16820167505" rel="sponsored noopener">NewEgg currently has a sale for the 1.5tb unit for only $299 USD with promo code SUMMER673.</a> This price is still more expensive than high end NVMe SSDs, but if you want the absolute best loading times nothing on the market beats Optane yet - not even the fastest PCI-e 5 SSDs.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC rolls out to players worldwide, Steam Deck fans have discovered a glitch that makes the game impossible to play. The glitch seemed to arrive alongside <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-v1-12-patch-notes-shadow-of-the-erdtree-weapon-and-skill-adjustments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">update 1.12</a> and will seriously halt your game if you leave your Tarnished alone for too long. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">Steam Deck users noticed an issue that made the game unresponsive to any inputs. FromSoftware took to Twitter/X to confirm that this occurs if you leave the game running but leave your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes. The developer is working on hotfix for the glitch, but it’s not here yet. To avoid the issue happening to you, it’s important to keep your Tarnished moving.</p> <h2 id="h-don-t-stop-moving-in-elden-ring-if-you-re-playing-on-steam-deck-because-there-s-no-beating-the-inactivity-glitch-boss" data-injectable="false">Don’t stop moving in <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re playing on Steam Deck because there’s no beating the inactivity glitch boss</h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="784" data-injectable="true"><em>Elden Ring</em>‘s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC is one of the most highly-anticipated releases of 2024. Some might be playing right now and, in the middle of their runs, need to put the Steam Deck down and go take care of something. However, doing this without batting a button or joystick every few minutes like an impatient cat will cause the game to lock you out entirely at the moment.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Note: a Steam Deck related issue has been identified and a hotfix is being worked on.</p><p>Leaving your Steam Deck inactive for more than 5 minutes may stop the game from accepting inputs.</p><p>We apologize for inconvenience.</p><p>The date and time of the hotfix will be announced separately.</p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware is working on an update, but hasn’t announced when it will be able to release a patch to fix <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this issue</a>. Thankfully, this error popped up on the day that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> was released, so the developer was likely waiting for error reports. Not all errors are created equal, though. Some take a few hours to be patched, while others can take much longer.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Since the release of the latest patch, I’ve seen a couple of <a href="https://x.com/BillalNX/status/1803730889387495585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports of errors</a> in <em>Elden Ring</em> on social media. They aren’t common enough that it looks like everyone is affected, but quite a few players have launched the game and have been waiting until the DLC goes live, only to be met with an error screen and an inability to load their perfectly placed Tarnished.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true">If you’re playing the game on Steam Deck, the safest way to do so is to just keep moving. Don’t leave your game for longer than 5 minutes, or you’ll likely need to reboot. Mercifully, <em>Elden Ring</em> runs well on Valve’s handheld device, so this shouldn’t be too much of a problem for loading screens.</p>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">My best advice for you is to just be mindful of when you’re taking breaks, and for how long. If you plan on putting the Steam Deck down before the hotfix is out, maybe make sure you’ve saved and quit. We’ll update the piece as soon as FromSoft has a fix online.</p>

You can find this "first and last" Elden Ring DLC expansion on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">Steam</a>, the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-pre-order/9N5P5SC2RZ7K/0017">Xbox Store</a> and in the suppurating depths of your very worst nightmares. Am I overdoing it yet? No matter. Let's press on.</p><!--more-->
<p>Perhaps you've never heard of Elden Ring's Erdtree DLC. Perhaps you've sauntered in here expecting a nice game about looking at antique rings while lying under some shady topiary. Come child, I'll soon birth thee anew. Shadow Of The Erdtree is a lategame Elden Ring add-on which rudely attaches a grotty new region, The Land Of Shadow, to the base game's festering Lands Between. Here you'll find a host of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapon-types">weapons</a>, enemies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">bosses</a> and stories concerning the fate of Miquella, a character who is of huge importance to the main Elden Ring storyline.</p>
<p>Once again: this is a lategame add-on, designed to sizzle the nerves and parboil the synapses of all but the most seasoned and well-equipped Tarnished adventurers, though it does at least have more or less the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-system-requirements">system requirements</a> as the main game. Our own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-what-level">recommended Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree starting level</a> is between 120-150, and you'll need to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">reach certain areas and defeat certain bosses</a> before you can enter the Land of Shadow, though you don't need to finish the game. If you're a NG+ player in need of reorientation, we've also written a guide to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-fastest-way-to-reach-shadow-of-the-erdtree">fastest way to reach Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> - 24 steps, each more harrowing than the last. Speaking as a lapsed player who keeps meaning to get back into Elden Ring and failing, I am currently squatting on step 11.5 - "Sob uncontrollably on the bridge of Redmane Castle".</p>
<p>If you're already hip to all these Elden antics, you might be more interested in knowing whether Shadow Of The Erdtree is any good. I don't know for sure, but I know somebody who does: Ed Thorn, aka Starscourge Edders, who went to the trouble of publishing an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree review</a> a few days ago. He was a bit ambivalent, actually, describing the expansion as a "pseudo-sequel" and praising its greater emphasis on crafty exploration, while sternly withholding the Bestest Best badge.</p>
<p>"The Land Of Shadow may not be as expansive as the base game's Lands Between, but it's knottier, denser, more of a twisting mass that burrows into the earth and soars into the skies," Ed wrote. "For this reason I think it produces some of Elden Ring's finest moments, as exploration leads to a truer sense of discovery reminiscent of old Souls. But I also think its sheer density exposes more chinks in its open world format, where its interconnected sprawl leads to even greater recollection paralysis." Recollection paralysis! I'm pretty sure that's what you get from Basilisks.</p>
<p>Now that Erdtree is out, the insatiable gamer brain promptly turns to what FromSoftware might work on next. President and Dark Souls series creator Hidetaka Miyazaki has already <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-reflects-on-how-becoming-a-father-might-influence-his-future-games">offered some wistful ruminations on the experience of fatherhood as an inspiration, if not a direct theme</a>. Personally, I'd like to play a FromSoftware game that gets away from the "corrupted rulers in need of purgation" premise that has broadly defined FromSoftware's output since Demon's Souls. I'm not sure what I want, but I don't want to have to topple another ruined king. A man may tire of destroying or usurping a polluted cosmic order. How about you?</p>
