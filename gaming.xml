			<p>This week, those who are interested are being given the opportunity to try out Escape from Tarkov: Arena. The free weekend will be starting on December 20 at 4 AM ET / 1 AM PT / 9 AM GMT and will finish on December 23. This gives you enough time to experiment and have fun in Escape From Tarkov: Arena and see if this is <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-arena-standalone-game-gets-new-teaser/">a game</a> for you. If this is something you want to get stuck into, all you have to do is register on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and then install the launcher. From there, you'll be good to go and will get to participate in the free weekend.</p>
<p>As an additional gift for participating in the free weekend, players will all receive a unique Snowman T-Shirt, which is rewarded to players who complete the special quest given to them. Regardless of whether you own the game after the free weekend is over, the item will remain in your account permanently, which also includes being in the original Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>During this event, there will also be a small Twitch Drops campaign, which will allow you to get some free extra rewards by watching streams in the game's category. This includes rewards such as in-game currency and exclusive holiday-themed Oakley SI Gascan White Glasses and the Winter half-mask to wear while battling it out for survival in Tarkov's arenas.</p>
<p>Along with the free weekend, Patch 0.16.0.0 will be released for Escape From Tarkov. When this patch is released, all data on the server will be wiped. This is because the game will then be transferred over to the 2022 Unity engine, along with sound system improvements and a refresh of several locations within the game.</p>
<p>Once this has happened, the Winter Drops Event will take place, and players will be able to get their hands on some more goodies in-game to kit them out and give them the festive spirit.</p>
<p>At the moment, there aren't any details about the upcoming patch, but it's been confirmed that details regarding the patch and the full schedule for the Winter Drops Event will be announced soon so that you can keep up to date with what's happening in Escape from Tarkov.</p>
<p>Will you be playing Escape from Tarkov: Arena?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/bring-in-holidays-with-first-warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> can now enjoy a song performed in-universe. Games Workshop announced an official Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn in celebration of the holidays, allowing fans to praise the God Emperor of Man during the most wonderful time of the year.</p>

<h2>The Warhammer 40,000 Imperial Hymn Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/s48clzhx/praise-the-emperor-with-the-first-ever-official-imperial-hymn/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Community post</a>, Games Workshop revealed the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn through a first-of-its-kind music video.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=JDwL8wx_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-sister-of-battle.jpg?itok=IPUA3OH9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the world of <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, humanity has no time for cheer, hope, or goodwill towards men. This is due to the authoritarian nightmare regime that is the Imperium of Man, demanding absolute loyalty to the eradication its enemies. Heretics, xenos scum, and the forces of Chaos must be given no quarter.</p>

<p>So how else can you celebrate the holidays in the grim darkness of the far future but with a hymn singing the praises of the all-powerful God Emperor of Man?</p>

<p>Given the franchise's rising popularity thanks to the sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a> and its mainstream exposure through the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, it would makes sense that Games Workshop would go this extra mile.</p>

<p>In this regard, Games Workshop pulled out all the stops for the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Imperial Hymn music video. The video itself has the song being sung by the Sisters of Battle. The audio plays out among animated vignettes of them on bloody battlefields and kneeling in prayer in gothic cathedrals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-battle-vignette.jpg?itok=9-zDZriy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-imperial-hymn-battle-vignette.jpg?itok=HLi2aXM3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The hymn was composed by Jonathan Hartman, whose work has featured on several Warhammer+ shows. The choral singers were hand selected and directed by George Elekov in Sofia, Bulgaria.</p>

<p>For diehard fans, the lyrics are of special note. The hymn isn't sung in English but in the fictional language of the Imperium: High Gothic. This blend of Latin and other languages hasn't been explicitly spoken or seen before in Warhammer 40,000 works. If you're a huge fan of this setting's impeccably vast lore, this is for you.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you are interested in the vignettes in this music video, a limited supply of art prints will be available for purchase in the New Year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-want-to-live-in-the-silo.1065816/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/silo-apple-tv-architecture-politics-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am an <em>enormous</em> fan of <em>Silo</em>, having first run into it as a comic (I missed the books, sorry!) and now as a TV series currently screening its second season on Apple. And while I love Rebecca Ferguson and I love Tim Robbins and I love everything the show is trying to say about class and power and the human spirit, I'll admit I am mostly watching it for the silo itself.</p><p>It's a <em>breathtaking </em>exercise in world-building. I want to visit. I want to touch it. I want to live there, in a way I have rarely felt about a fictional space before. Please note I'm not saying I want to live in <em>Silo's</em> fundamentalist autocracy, trapped in a class system that's so entrenched it's physically represented in the design of the structure itself. Nor am I advocating for some kind of future apocalypse that forces our entire species to live underground for centuries at a time, with the air above so toxic it causes almost instantaneous death. I just think the silo itself is cool, and I want to spend some time in it experiencing how it all works.</p><p>Let me tell you something about me that might help you see where I'm coming from here. I'm a freak for a fully-realised fictional space. The Hero's Journey is fine, romantic subplots and epic tales have their place, but if your game/show/comic/book manages to depict what it's like for the average person to live, work and die in its make-believe world, I am IN.</p><p>I'm often into fiction as an escape, so the more comprehensive the escape, the better. Do you know what my favourite scene in <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> is? When they auction off the last tube of toothpaste in the universe. <em>Game of Thrones</em>? Any time someone is arguing about the budget. <em>Andor</em>? Seeing the bureaucracy in action.</p><figure><figcaption>The silo's monotonous design and vertical structure serves as a physical representation of its deep-rooted class system</figcaption></figure><p>A fictional world imagined in full is a magical place, allowing me to not just escape the real world and pay it a visit as long as a game or episode lasts, but for it to burrow its way into the depths of my imagination. I've found myself walking to work thinking about the relationship between Gas Town, the Bullet Farm and the Citadel. I've sat on the tram thinking about the daily commute for the civilians trapped inside the SDF-1. I've even been at a doctor's office thinking about all the hilarious and terrifying ways you can die in <em>Raised By Wolves</em>, and that once you were dead, what that would mean for whichever weirdo faction you'd been a part of.</p><p>I think about <em>Silo </em>a <em>lot</em>. As a fictional setting it is--despite, or perhaps because of its intimate focus--a complete world, one with history, politics, a social structure and conflicts between them. The 10,000 people trapped in that place are living full human lives, they're believing in stuff and all (mostly) working towards something. In every shot of Apple's excellent series you can single out any passerby in the background and wonder what their role is, which floor they live on, what that would mean for their family life, what their dreams for the future would be.</p><p>Which means I can imagine myself in there too. I can picture myself getting up in the morning in my surprisingly architectural apartment, showering, getting dressed and making myself a meal in the fully-functional kitchen everybody in the show seems to have. Maybe while turning for the door I'd brush my shoulders against the thick concrete walls, which have lasted many lifetimes and will last many more. I might kiss my wife goodbye, and any kids I was lucky enough to be allowed to have by the government, then head off to sit at a desk all day, crunching numbers and data on a whirring old green-screened computer, doing my part to keep the silo running and everyone, if not happy, then at least in line.</p><figure><figcaption>For a show that's essentially dystopian, the apartments are great. I love the tiles!</figcaption></figure><p>Or maybe I wouldn't! Maybe I'd be toiling away down in mechanical, looked down upon by everyone above me, yet also acutely aware that because I control the lights and air I hold the fate of the entire silo in my hands. I could be in recycling, the wizards of my age, the lucky few standing between the remnants of an advanced society and, if enough toasters and monitors were to break, the stone age.</p><p>Regardless of my job, I can feel the weight of each room's steel doors as they swing open, clearly designed to last centuries, and feel the CLUNK of their industrial-strength latches as they close. I can taste the food, as fresh as it could be given the circumstances, and I wonder if I'd ever get sick of the same meals over and over, or if that wouldn't bother me since I'd never known any other life. I can hear the clack of every beige keyboard, the hum of the screens, the whirring of the ventilation system keeping everyone alive since the air above is almost instantly poisonous.</p><p>Climbing up and down the stairs all day just to get anywhere would annoy me, the me living on this Earth in 2024, but the imagined me inhabiting the silo would probably benefit from all the exercise. And besides, there'd be no point complaining about it anyway, it's not like there's an elevator; these classes of workers need to be kept as physically separate as possible, the place was designed like that on purpose (as we're particularly finding out in the last few episodes!).</p><p>What would I, someone who had never known the outside, think about the outside? Probably whatever I was told! I've never felt the sun, never known the wind, never smelled freshly-cut grass or heard the roar of the ocean. All I've ever known is the concrete walls of the silo, so if something happened that challenged my established view of what was outside its walls, maybe I simply wouldn't believe it. Or maybe it would light a fire inside my imagination, and others, and there'd be revolution.</p><figure><figcaption>The silo is governed by an old, pre-apocalypse text known as "The Pact", which supposedly exists to keep everyone safe (and in line), but it can't account for every eventuality. </figcaption></figure><p>If the time came for that revolution, would I join in? I don't know, man! It's easy as someone watching this on TV to cheer for those wanting to get outside, or to at least affect change inside a silo, but if the silo had been all anyone had known for centuries, would I risk it all? I don't know!</p><p>It's not often I find myself daydreaming about what the <em>entirety </em>of a life must be like inside a fictional universe as much as <em>Silo's</em>, but then there are few fictional universes that have mapped out their structure and design so comprehensively. The silo was built to last, and it has lasted, and every shot and scene of this fantastic TV show revels in a place where 10,000 people live now, but where so many others have lived and died before them as well.</p><p>It's so thorough that it doesn't even feel like a set, so much as something that's been filmed on location. The silo looks like a place I can actually visit and walk through, learn about and explore. A historical attraction from a different timeline. A place I can touch and smell and wander its halls. Like I've said already, I don't want to live there forever, but it seems real enough that I'd at least like to visit.</p><p><em>Silo </em>might be a show about some of the last survivors on Earth, trapped forever inside a concrete bunker that sucks, but as a microcosm of a fully-realised human society--structurally and architecturally, all in the one place--it's a masterpiece.</p><figure><figcaption>We see every level and every class in Silo, from the elite to the workers. We also know they have pretzels and coffee, which is a surprise considering the circumstances. </figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-immersive-machinegames"><h3>A Wheezy Indiana Jones Is Incredibly Relatable</h3></a><p>'Always knew someday you’d come unlocking, opening then walking back through my door'</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While a pirate-themed setting is perfect for video games, titles that allow players to travel on the high seas in search of adventure and treasure are very difficult to come by nowadays. For this reason, <a href="https://wccftech.com/flint-treasure-of-oblivion-to-launch-by-october-24-story-trailer-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flint: Treasure of Oblivion</a> by Savage Level caught the eye of more than a few players with its setting, story, and characters, as well as for its tactical gameplay, which combines a somewhat straightforward turn-based combat system with features lifted from trading card games, with a sprinkle of tabletop RPGs features on top, such as visible die rolls for attacks and defense.</p>
<p>While all of these features could have made for a very engaging experience, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion fails to deliver on most fronts. The foundation of a solid tactical role-playing game is definitely there, but the many issues of the experience prevent the game from being nothing more than an average and, more often than not, frustrating experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241216111120_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The story is definitely one of the best features of the game, if not the very best, mostly thanks to the main character, the legendary Golden Age pirate captain James Flint, who is also featured in a lot of pirate-themed novels, movies, and TV shows, such as Treasure Island by Rober Louis Stevenson. At the beginning of the game, the legendary pirate captain and his first mate, Billy Bones, manage to survive a shipwreck only to end up in a French island fort. A death sentence for their pirate activities is the only thing they have to look forward to. During their stay in the fort's prison, however, the ever-resourceful Captain Flint not only manages to get a whiff of treasure but also to find a way out of prison, fighting against other not-so-well-mannered prisoners and bribing corrupt guards. After making their escape, Captain Flint and Billy Bones will put together their own crew in the town of Saint-Malo and eventually sail on what is an enjoyable yet too predictable pirate adventure.</p>
<p>While the plot of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion may be a little straightforward, it is quite engaging mainly thanks to Captain Flint, who is an amazing protagonist and the perfect embodiment of what a pirate captain should be. Bold, brash, unafraid of taking action, often of the unsavory, violent type, with a quip always on his tongue, seeing the legendary pirate in action is very amusing, as much as his interactions with other characters are. At the very start of the game, for example, while stranded at sea, James Flint attempts to eat his first mate, who is presumed dead and does not stop even when the man wakes up, very well alive.</p>
<p>Enhancing the adventures of pirate captain James Flint and his crew in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is the way the story is presented. Doing away with the voice-acted cutscenes or the silent dialogue boxes seen in countless other games, developer Savage Level went with some gorgeous comic book panels that give the game a very peculiar visual novel feel that suits both the story and setting extremely well. It made the story so enjoyable that it would have made the flawed gameplay almost bearable, if there weren't so many issues that made playing the game both a slog and incredibly frustrating.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241217112241_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>On the surface, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the gameplay of Flint: Treasure of Oblivion. Its tactical turn-based combat, for example, is solid enough, and the card game mechanics are not a source of particular complication, as they essentially work as a regular skill and equipment system. Top-down exploration and traversal are not at all innovative, but they look functional in the context of this pirate adventure. What really breaks the game is the execution of these mechanics and the systems that power them.</p>
<p>Starting with combat, almost every one of its features and mechanics leaves something to be desired. The interface is too convoluted, requiring way too many clicks to perform the easiest of actions like moving, attacking, using skills, and switching characters. For example, after deciding to attack an enemy, you need to click on the enemy first and then on the dies that appear after the selection has been made. In addition, if, for some reason, you have spent one of the two APs to move and attempt to click on an enemy without selecting the attack option first, you may end up wasting an AP to perform a movement-based ability on the enemy, which can be used to knock down or push the enemy. This can be generally useful - if only the player is not performing these actions by mistake. The battlefields' visual design also makes combat even worse, as the interface does a terrible job of highlighting if it is possible to traverse certain areas.</p>
<p>The combat issues in Flint: Treasure of Oblivion don't stop at the poor interface. Besides the aforementioned traditional AP system, which grants two actions per turn per character, the game features a morale system that influences attack and defense rolls, a skill system, and an equipment system powered by cards. These systems are poorly explained by some very unexhaustive in-game tutorials that only manage to create more confusion. For example, I'm still not sure what truly influences the morale level for both player and enemy or the calculations that go into the die rolls. As a result, combat feels like it's purely dominated by RNG (random number generation).</p>
<p>Animations are also stiff and very basic, and sound effects are barely audible, which contributes to the overall failure to convey the visceral feel of pirates fighting for treasure and often for their own lives. Leveling up characters is just as needlessly convoluted as fighting enemies, as to improve characters' stats, the player must first share the bounty in a dedicated menu, then head over to the stats menu and pick which stat to increase. With so many games handling all of these features in a much better way, I was truly baffled at how Flint: Treasure of Oblivion fumbles so much in this regard.</p>
<p>Exploration and traversal don't fare much better. Besides being as straightforward as they appear, they suffer due to the confusing design of several locations, a map system that doesn't help players get their own bearings that much, and a bad camera that cannot be rotated during exploration. This feels like a major oversight, considering it is possible to do so during combat, although in a very clunky way.</p>
<p>What really makes Flint: Treasure of Oblivion very frustrating to play, however, are the controls. No matter if you're using a controller or keyboard and mouse, you are going to run into issues, and to reduce them, I essentially had to play with both. During exploration, for example, controllers work better, as you can directly control James Flint as if it were any old top-down game. With mouse and keyboard controls, however, the game is controlled as an old-school RPG, meaning that you have to click to get the characters to move towards any given location. The annoying clicking sound is the least of the problems here, as characters sometimes get stuck, and it is not possible to scroll the scene, as characters always need to be on camera.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/20241216141613_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In battles, on the other hand, using a controller led to one of the most frustrating gaming experiences I had all year. Selecting a hexagon becomes a challenge, as is doing pretty much everything else except speeding up the enemy turn due to a combination of imprecise controls and the poor design of the interface, which is the same no matter which control type the player is using. As such, I had to switch to mouse and keyboard controls during combat, which work reasonably well, even with the poor interface. In the end, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is possibly the only game on PC that has to be played with both a controller and mouse and keyboard for an "optimal" experience that still leaves something to be desired. Console players, on the other hand, won't have the luxury of multiple control options and will suffer from these issues the most.</p>
<p>Amidst all these issues, Flint: Treasure of Oblivion at least runs decently, at the very least. While the available graphics options are limited to a generic graphics setting, resolution, and framerate cap, with no support for any upscaler, the simple and not particularly detailed locations shouldn't be too demanding for most system configurations. On my machine (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), the game ran at an average of 80 FPS&nbsp; at 4K resolution, high settings in most scenarios, so I expect even dated systems to run the game well at lower resolutions and settings.</p>
<p>Flint: Treasure of Oblivion has the foundation of a solid tactical role-playing game, but the game clearly needed more time in the oven to work out its many issues. As things stand at launch, however, it is only an average, often frustrating experience that is barely salvaged by the short 10-hour-long story, charming protagonist, and comic-book style presentation.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Flint: Treasure of Oblivion is a game that undoubtedly required way more time in the oven. While its engaging story, captivating presentation, and the charismatic pirate captain James Flint pull players into the adventure early on, the experience is marred by a horrendous interface, clunky controls, poor tutorials, and the subpar execution of several mechanics. As a result, the game is hard to recommend except to the most dedicated tactical role-playing game enthusiasts willing to overlook its many glaring flaws.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A second trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/catly/">Catly</a>--a cat-raising game that debuted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/">2024's The Game Awards</a> but has since been met with accusations of AI use--has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" rel="nofollow ">appeared on the game's Steam page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer (which is not currently on YouTube) shows a number of features that provide a slightly clearer picture of what the game itself is about. In it, cats with both realistic coats and strangely colored fur prance the street, before the game's cat creator is revealed, which allows players to customize their cat's appearance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370"></a><figcaption>The game allows players to create cats with unnatural fur colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whether players want a realistic-looking calico coat or a dye job that makes their cat look more like a Pokemon, the cat maker appears to provide customization for both cats' physical appearances and their clothes. In fact, the game comes with a whole wardrobe of clothing and accessories for players to put on their digital felines.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows off the game's worldbuilder, which appears to allow players to build oddly charming, alien-looking locales to house their furry friends in. Despite how visually odd some players have found the game, a representative for Catly developer SuperAuthenti says it finds the accusations of AI use surprising, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts" rel="nofollow ">claims that generative AI has played no part in the game's development</a>. Still, some have found the game's promotional images to be suspicious, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/comment/m1zej2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">claiming there's evidence of the artifacting</a> often seen when an image is AI-generated. According to the game's developers, however, that isn't the case.</p><p>SuperAuthenti has not yet announced a release date for Catly, but it's currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Just one day before the theatrical release of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Paramount Pictures has confirmed the next movie in the series. First reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-release-date-2027-1236254778/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will release in theaters in spring 2027.</p>



<p>No other details about what Sonic the Hedgehog 4 would be about were revealed. The only thing we can guess comes from spoilers of the latest movie, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits scene</a> that reveals another new character.</p>



<p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 features the return of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles along with Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. Joining the cast for the third film is Keanu Reeves who voices Shadow the Hedgehog. And, yes, Shadow does have his gun.</p>



<p>Based on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sonic_the_hedgehog_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">early reviews</a>, the latest movie in the franchise is going to be yet another success. According to Variety, it’s expected to make anywhere from $55-$60 million at North American theaters on opening weekend. The first two movies pulled in roughly $725.4 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 already being announced? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/stalker-2-has-been-enjoyable-jank-but-its-also-getting-rapidly-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When the impossibly punctuated <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chernobyl</em></a> released on November 20, after many delays (that included <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq843dg4geo">the Russian invasion of the developer's native Ukraine</a>), it seemed like it could have used even more delays.</p>
<p><em>Stalker 2</em> had big performance issues and game-breaking bugs, along with balance and difficulty spike issues. Some things that seem "wrong" in the game are just going to stay that way. The first-person survival/shooter series has always had a certain wobbly, wild feel to it. This expresses itself in both the game world, where a major villain can off themselves by walking through a window, and in the tech stack, where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/03/new-stalker-patch-breaks-saved-games/">broken save games</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2007/04/st-a-l-k-e-r-proves-you-can-have-just-as-much-fun-tweaking-as-you-can-playing/">DIY optimization</a>, and other unmet needs have created <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl">thriving mod scenes</a>.</p>
<p>Developer GSC Game World has been steadfastly patching the game since its release, and the latest one should nudge the needle a bit from "busted" to "charmingly wonky." Amid the "Over 1,800 fixes and adjustments" in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/525329871842312365?l=english">Patch 1.1</a>, the big changes are to "A-Life." In porting&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em> to Unreal Engine 5, the developer faced a challenge in getting this global AI management system working, but it's showing its weird self again.</p>
<p>A-Life, as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-a-life-in-stalker-and-why-is-it-important/">detailed by Destructoid</a>, is the idea that "the characters in the game live their own lives and exist all the time, not only when they are in the player's field of view." In a certain radius around the player, events happen "online," in real time, such that you could stumble upon them. Farther out, things are still happening, and non-player characters (NPCs) are trekking about, but on an "offline," almost turn-based, less resource-intensive schedule. Modders have had quite a bit of fun tweaking A-life in prior versions of <em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>
<p>With the latest patch, the weirdly engaging feel that the world goes on without you returns. There will be more NPCs visible, NPCs out of range will pursue their "goals," and a more diverse range of human factions, mutants, and weirdos will exist. Perhaps most intriguingly, an issue where "Human NPCs didn't satisfy their communication needs and talks" is fixed. If only that could be patched for most of us player characters here in the real world.</p>

			<p>It's been reported today that 11 bit studios have canceled the development of their console-centric game, which was codenamed Project 8. The development of this title first started in 2018, and approximately 37 people were working on it by September 2024. With this game being canceled, there have been a number of layoffs, which are yet to be determined. It's been estimated that 11 Bit Studios has spent PLN 48.4 million ($11.8 million) on the development of this project up until now. The <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information was released</a> on the 11 bit studios website, where they talked about the reason behind the project's cancellation.</p>
<p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rick games held stronger appeal," says Przemysław Marszał, President of the Management Board at 11 bit studios. It has been stated that the shifting market trends were not the only reason behind Project 8's cancellation. The game was being developed during a very rocky period, as the game had to continue development through a global pandemic.</p>
<p>"With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilizing the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew," explains Marszał.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that there will be a reduction in staff of those who were involved in the development of Project 8. However, Marszał has confirmed that the employees affected by layoffs will receive severance packages, as well as assistance in finding new work and psychological counseling for those who need it.</p>
<p>From the report, it seems that they are hoping that the layoffs will be minimal, as Marszał says that more than half of the current team who were working on Project 8 will be offered opportunities within the company, allowing them to transition to existing teams or to begin on new, unannounced projects.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, 11-bit studios is continuing intensive work on several key projects, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-2-already-profitable-sales-top-350k/">Frostpunk 2</a>, which recently became the Company's first title to win the industry's prestigious The Game Awards. The team is also gearing up for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/">the launch of The Alters</a>, another highly anticipated release."</p>
<p>At the moment, there isn't much information about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alters&nbsp;</a>other</span>&nbsp;than that it's a sci-fi game with base-building elements. The game is set to release in Q1 2025, but with this announcement, it's uncertain whether they will be able to keep to that time frame.</p>

It takes inspiration from Blizzard’s game in plenty of ways, from general game modes to its style of monetization. Another way it takes inspiration is in its characters.</p><p>Some hero abilities in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> are clearly taken right from <em>Overwatch </em>characters. Many characters are pretty conceptually similar as well. For instance, Hulk comes to mind as a very similar concept to D. Va, both heroes have a “transformation” to make them immensely more powerful. That can be useful to keep in mind if you’re coming into <em>Rivals</em> fresh from <em>Overwatch</em> and want to roll with characters that feel familiar. </p><p><br>Luckily for you, we’ve put together a collection of five  characters so similar to <em>Overwatch </em>characters that many will find themselves right at home when jumping in. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-recommend-id="image://37c379b421ddaefada7bc64cdc0fbf8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Widowmaker and Black Widow are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, if you can believe it, the two characters with “Widow” in their name play incredibly similar. Black Widow’s sniper will be incredibly familiar to Widowmaker veterans, and she has a movement ability to help get her into the perfect sniper position. Their close-quarters combat varies a bit, and they have different Ultimates, but Black Widow is an easy main for former Widowmaker players.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-recommend-id="image://4fb0fbcd7b18aa84f34a15c5883ce65a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hanzo and Hawkeye are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another obvious Avengers parallel, Hawkeye and Hanzo are natural counterparts. Their abilities differ a bit, though. Hawkeye’s slashing abilities are unique to his kit, and his Ultimate is something completely new. However, the similarity in their main bow and arrow shots is undeniable. Hanzo mains should absolutely be running to try Hawkeye as their first character in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-recommend-id="image://680a98443b5a6fb2c8c7c9b7418144e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Junkrat and Squirrel Girl are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl is already proving to be a force to be reckoned with in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, just like her very similar counterpart, Junkrat. Squirrel Girl’s primary fire grenade launcher is similar to Junkrat’s. And the similarities go far beyond the main weapon. She has a traversal ability to bounce on her tail to give her extra height, not too dissimilar from Junkrat. In addition, her secondary fire helps stun people. While it’s more active than Junkrat’s Steel Trap, these two abilities work in much the same way. Overall, Junkrat fans may find a lot of muscle memory transfers over to Squirrel Girl.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-recommend-id="image://1016d60f24097e92d2cec965a43f1aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Winston and Venom are juxtaposed together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Winston is a tank that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-problem-with-overwatchs-dive-meta-1796828151">dominated <em>Overwatch</em>’s infamous dive meta</a></span>, and Venom has a lot of similar shades. Both are tanks that rely on leaping headfirst into trouble. Once they’re in the enemy backlines, their primary attacks are both short range “beams” that don’t do heavy damage but can really add up over time. Venom’s other abilities are more focused on self-sustaining than providing specific cover for teammates, but if you played Winston in <em>Overwatch</em>, a switch from the simian to the symbiote may be in order for you.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-recommend-id="image://f60c3bf9239ab582c8ad72ed762fd3fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baptiste and Rocket Raccoon are juxtaposed next to each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rocket Raccoon plays like a much simpler version of <em>Overwatch</em>’s high-flying support, Baptiste. Like Baptiste, Rocket fires healing grenades with a secondary fire, and uses a traditional ballistic weapon as their primary. They also have a powerful ability that requires a lot of trigger discipline: Immortality Beacon for Baptiste, and the B.R.B. for Rocket. Finally, both have a damage-boosting Ultimate ability. While Baptiste’s is a screen, Rocket’s shoots damage boosting beams surrounding his device.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays, everyone. 11 Bit Studios has announced that it has cancelled its game known as Project 8 will have layoffs at the studio because of it.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement released</a> earlier this week, 11 Bit Studios says they had 37 people working on the game up until the decision to end it was made. As far as why it was cancelled, a number of reasons were given by 11 Bit Studios President Przemyslaw Marszal.</p>



<p>“With&nbsp;Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks,” he said. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project’s budget grew.”</p>



<p>He then said that the “tipping point” happened after what Marszal called a “thorough evaluation” of the game’s latest milestone.</p>



<p>“When assessing a project, the Management Board always considers its development progress, including internal reviews and independent surveys,” Marzal said.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, in this case, our findings revealed unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project’s overall profitability.”</p>



<p>The exact number of layoffs at 11 Bit Studios weren’t revealed. However, it was said that “more than half” of the Project 8 team will be offered the opportunity to move to other projects within the company. Those who are being let go will receive severance packages, counselling, and assistance with finding new work.</p>



<p>The company estimates to have spent $11.8 million on the game’s development at the time of cancellation. Marszal said that the full cost of ending Project 8 won’t be known until the release of the company’s Annual Report for 2024.</p>



<p>The games industry has seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">nearly 15,000 known jobs</a> lost in 2024. The real number is likely approaching 17,000 when taking into account unconfirmed numbers.</p>

That said, the new superhero title does attempt to spice things up with fun concepts like destructible environments and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-hero-shooter-overwatch-team-attacks-how-1851718182">Team-Up abilities</a></span>. One of the more unique original ideas the game puts forward is the Season Bonus, although it’s left most of us just confused if anything.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196395,196049" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The biggest problem with Season Bonus is that there isn’t any official explanation for it. Outside some brief mentions in-game, the most information I can find on it was just a bunch of players in the official Discord asking questions and occasionally getting an evaluated guess of an answer from a fellow player. But after some rigorous testing and cross-references with other materials, I’ve put together a handy breakdown of everything you need to know about Season Bonuses.</p><h2 id="h6426"><a id="whatis"></a>What is a Season Bonus?</h2><p><strong>Season Bonuses are class-specific buffs provided to a set of characters: </strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Vanguards get extra health </strong></li><li><strong>Duelists get a damage boost </strong></li><li><strong>Strategists get a healing bonus</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Each of the characters receiving these bonuses is involved in Team-Up Abilities. More specifically, each one serves as an anchor or initiator for them.</p><p>We’re assuming that this isn’t just a massive coincidence and the characters mentioned above were chosen for their Team-Ups role. The yellow symbol for Season Bonus is also used to infer to Team-Up Anchors after all. Adjusting these bonuses could be a way to motivate players to use these characters, or perhaps be a method of balancing on the developer’s part. Something that ties into both of those is the presumption that Season Bonuses will only last throughout the season. </p><p>The next season could adjust the values of these bonuses or provide them to entirely different characters. If these are indeed meant to be tied to Team-Ups, we could also see the debut of new ones and potentially the shelving of others. Again, we can only make guesses about Season Bonuses since we don’t have a proper explanation. Fingers crossed we have a detailed breakdown come time for Season One.</p><h2 id="h6427"><a id="activate"></a>How to activate a Season Bonus</h2><figure id="" data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-recommend-id="image://522818f18a5795f8d58c6ce1dcd161aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hero Profile page for Groot, shows his Team-Up Anchor Season Bonus in the bottom left." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a good chance that the first time you saw mention of a Season Bonus was while you were picking a hero to play. It might have even been after you remembered that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661"><em>Kotaku</em>’s <em>Marvel Rivals</em> intro tips</a></span> recommended reading your hero profiles before heading into a match. Considering the Season Bonus is only for Anchor heroes and is listed underneath their Team-Up information, you likely assumed this bonus will only activate when the Team-Up ability does. However, these two things aren’t related in that way. <strong>A character’s Season Bonus is active at all times, no matter who is on their team.</strong></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-tips-team-up-currency-battle-pass-heroes-1851715661">11 Things To Know Before Starting <em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span></p><p>I cross-referenced this with the official base stats for heroes provided on the game’s website. For example, Groot’s base health is listed as 700 on the website. His health during actual gameplay is 850. It remains at this value no matter if Rocket Raccoon and/or Jeff the Land Shark are on his team. Naturally, checking out his season bonus will show that he is receiving an extra 150 bonus health.</p><h2 id="h6428"><a id="season0"></a>List of Season Bonuses in Season 0<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-recommend-id="image://42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-recommend-id="image://42b1220044f5b4f1d500583a473262eb" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Team-Up Ability page, with Adam Warlock’s Guardian Revival ability and his 15% healing bonus highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are 14 characters with Season Bonuses in “Season 0: Doom’s Rise.” As mentioned above, the buff they receive is dependent on what class they’re in. However, there is a bit of variance in the values of these buffs. Here is the list of current season bonuses:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Thor – +100 Max Health</li><li>Groot – +150 Max Health</li><li>Hulk – +150 Max Health</li><li>Venom – +150 Max Health</li><li>Rocket Raccoon – +5% Healing Bonus</li><li>Adam Warlock – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Cloak &amp; Dagger – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Luna Snow – +15% Healing Bonus</li><li>Scarlet Witch – +10 Damage Bonus</li><li>Spider-Man – +10 Damage Bonus</li><li>Iron Fist – +15 Damage Bonus</li><li>Magik – +15 Damage Bonus</li><li>Hawkeye – +20 Damage Bonus</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hela – +20 Damage Bonus</li></ul><p>Season Bonus is a confusing mechanic in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> that a lot of players aren’t fans of given how cryptic it is.

It was made in RPG Maker, originally released in French, and has never received an official English translation, though multiple fan translations have sprung up over the years. It's also never been available on typical, popular PC storefronts such as Steam or itch.io, but instead has circulated over the years as a direct download, gaining a cult following due to how utterly weird, unsettling, and at times inscrutable it can be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">OFF puts the player in control of a mysterious baseball player-looking figure known as the Batter, who is instructed by a talking cat calling itself the Judge to travel through four Zones and kill ghostly creatures known as Spectres. The Zones themselves are haunting, upsetting places run by cruel leaders, composed of strange elements such as smoke, metal, plastic, meat, and sugar, and populated by confused and often suffering individuals who seem to be tormented by the Spectres. However, as the game progresses, the player is encouraged to question the actions of the Batter and themselves as a player, with multiple endings possible depending on the player's decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite never hitting the mainstream, OFF has served as an inspiration for a number of other hit RPGs, most notably Undertale (and most notably Undertale's absolute creepiest, freakiest stuff). The game is coming to Steam and Nintendo Switch in 2025 both digitally and as a physical edition via Fangamer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<strong>Giorno</strong>: Godly Level DPS, only 1 can be placed globally, big range, Slow passive, passive which chips enemies HP by 0.95% per hit and has an ability which sends all enemies to spawn, takes 10% of their HP, and slows all affected enemies down by 90%<br>
<strong>Rudeus</strong>: Terrible DPS, but a support ability to buff all units in range of his same element’s damage<br>
<strong>Makima</strong>: Very good DPS, passive to summon enemies that she killed equal to their original HP, no special status effect, no ability<br>
<strong>Denji</strong>: Meta DPS when girl in range, Best bleed unit in game, no ability"</p><p>With all of these changes, it will be interesting to see how players adapt. Alongside the new Boss Rush mode, these changes could make players have to rethink their team composition. While none of the buffs and nerfs were catastrophic, there are rumblings that the development team behind Anime Last Stand may be working on even more buffs and nerfs to change things even further. I'm intrigued to see what we could expect to see next time around. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Shaun Cichacki is a Freelance Contributor with IGN, covering features, guides, and news.

If you want all the Killzone items you’ll have to hand over Super Credits to the value of nearly twice the cost of a premium Warbond, and nearly half the price of Helldivers 2 itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Helldivers 2 Steam page</a>, Arrowhead said it had talked to Killzone developer Guerrilla Games and is now gifting the items that were meant to be sold as part of the crossover’s second wave next week.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“As this was our first crossover offering, we’ve been listening to the response, and the feedback we’ve received from our community surveys is that crossover content is really high up on your wishlists,” Arrowhead said in its statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the same time, some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Many of you were also concerned that items wouldn’t be in rotation for long enough, and there was a bit of concern around how these items exist outside of our usual Warbond releases, which are always themed in our own universe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because of all this, in partnership with our friends at Guerrilla (and as we’re in the season of holiday cheer), we’ve decided to offer a gift to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the Helldivers x Killzone collaboration items today, free of charge. The distribution of those items will begin shortly, in two waves.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/helldivers-1734623661949.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New Helldivers 2 x Killzone items are now available for free.

CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed that the Killzone crossover was initially meant to be released as part of a Warbond, but Arrowhead decided against it in the hopes of avoiding a backlash.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
