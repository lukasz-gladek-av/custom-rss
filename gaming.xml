          <p>Road trips with just two people always have their awkward silences. In&nbsp;<em>Dustland Delivery</em>, my character, a sharpshooter, has tried to break the ice with the blacksmith he hired a few towns back, with only intermittent success.</p>
<p>Remember that bodyguard, the one I unsuccessfully tried to flirt with at that bar? The blacksmith was uninterested. What about that wily junk dealer, or the creepy cemetery? Silence. She only wanted to discuss "Abandoned train" and "Abandoned factory," even though, in this post-apocalypse, abandonment was not that rare. But I made a note to look out for any rusted remains; stress and mood are far trickier to fix than hunger and thirst.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943280/Dustland_Delivery/"><em>Dustland Delivery</em></a>, available through Steam for Windows (and Proton/Steam Deck), puts you in the role typically taken up by NPCs in other post-apocalyptic RPGs. You're a trader, buying cheap goods in one place to sell at a profit elsewhere, and working the costs of fuel, maintenance, and raider attacks into your margins. You're in charge of everything on your trip: how fast you drive, when to rest and set up camp, whether to approach that caravan of pickups or give them a wide berth.</p>
<p>Some of you, the types whose favorite part of&nbsp;<em>The Oregon Trail</em> was the trading posts, might already be sold. For the others, let me suggest that the game is stuffed full of little bits of weird humor and emergent storytelling, and a wild amount of replayability for what is currently a $5 game. There are three quest-driven scenarios, plus a tutorial, in the base game. A new DLC out this week, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559340/Dustland_Delivery_Sheol/"><em>Sheol</em></a>, adds underground cities, ruins expeditions, more terrains, and a final story quest for four more dollars.</p>

		<p>It’s been a blowout week of news and announcements for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and we were lucky enough to be invited out to the hands on event in Paris to experience everything that’s new and coming to the console. An awful lot of people are going to still be on the fence (especially as other world events occurred), but there are some exciting games and intriguing features to entice through the first year of Switch 2, I think.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally all the headlines were dominated by the Nintendo Direct for the Nintendo Switch 2, with big game reveals, price and release date, and then the scramble to find all the little asides and caveats that didn’t make it into the main 60-minute stream.</p>

<h2>Games in Review &amp; Featured Articles</h2>
<p>In a change of pace, I’m going to highlight the flush of game previews from going hands on with the Nintendo Switch 2 at the in-person hands on event in Paris.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/mario-kart-world-preview-can-nintendo-revolutionise-the-karting-world-again/"><strong>Mario Kart World</strong></a> is looking to really shake up the familiar Mario Kart format with its big open world map and tracks, while keeping the gameplay feeling as crisp and tight as ever.

<p>With all of that, we had just two reviews:</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">Lost Skies</a>, the upcoming survival adventure co-op game that involves flying from one airborne island to the next, has a date set for its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> early access release: April 18, 2025. The news came from developer Bossa Games with a release date trailer showing off more gameplay and beauty shots for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Skies | Release Date Reveal Trailer | Humble Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vt9IdgLkvWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A playable build of Lost Skies was available during February's Steam Next Fest, and according to a press release from Bossa Games, it was one of the more popular titles during the festival. An uplifting note for the studio, to be sure, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/bossa-games-scales-back-team-focusing-on-lost-skies-development/">Bossa Games announced layoffs</a> at the top of the year.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear how many developers were laid off at the time, just that there were 40 team members left at Bossa Games to get Lost Skies across the finish line. It'll be interesting to see how the game's launch goes. Early access games are expected to not be perfect at launch, but it definitely couldn't have been easier to prepare Lost Skies for April 18th with fewer people working on the game.</p>
<p>At the time, Bossa Games co-chief executive officer Henrique Olifiers said that the layoff was so the team could focus on "<em>the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future.</em>" A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">gameplay trailer</a> had been showcased for Lost Skies only two weeks ahead of the layoff announcement.</p>
<p>That said, its popularity during Next Fest adds to the proof that Lost Skies is striking a chord with players. For Bossa Games' sake, hopefully, the early access launch will continue the momentum the Next Fest demo kicked up. The team aims to launch version 1.0 before the end of the year, though of course, this will depend on player feedback.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield Pro ‘Premium’ Subscription Uncovered by Dataminers]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-pro-%E2%80%98premium%E2%80%99-subscription-uncovered-by-dataminers.1156032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-pro-subscription-dataminers-uncover/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts might be working on a fresh iteration of the old ‘Battlefield Premium’ membership, but this time around, it’s set to be called Battlefield Pro. In a recent batch of information uncovered by dataminers (allegedly), it was claimed that Battlefield Pro would come with a string of benefits that include persistent server hosting on Battlefield Portal.</p>



<p>Amongst the benefits sat items like ‘exclusive instant unlocks’, tier skips for the game’s Battle Pass, a permanent XP boost, and access to unique challenges. It makes sense on paper, but as with all datamined content, you’ll need to take it with a pinch of salt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-premium-dude">Premium, Dude</h2>



<p>In a report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/bf-labs-datamine-battlefield-pro-lets-players-host-persistent-servers-in-portal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, it was claimed that dataminers have uncovered references to a Battlefield Pro subscription from Battlefield Labs. No source was given for the ‘leak’, but it admittedly makes sense that something like this would eventually exist in the new Battlefield space.</p>



<p>After all, we recently covered the impending reveal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-free-to-play-battle-royale-gamemode-has-been-datamined/">a free-to-play battle royale game</a> within the new Battlefield ecosystem. That kind of game is perfect for a ‘premium’ subscription model that includes access to a Battle Pass. </p>



<p>According to MP1st, the unidentified dataminers have claimed that the following content will be included with a Battlefield Pro subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Includes Battle Pass: Get all the perks and rewards from the Battle Pass in addition to extra exclusive content</li>



<li>6 Exclusive Instant Unlocks: Instantly access these BF Pro exclusive cosmetics</li>



<li>+10% Battle Pass XP</li>



<li>Portal: Host a Persistent Server</li>



<li>20 Tier Skips Included: Advance faster on the Battle Pass path to race to the final reward!</li>



<li>Exclusive Bonus Path: Gain access to this exclusive Bonus Path for additional exclusive content. Bonus Path will be released later this season.</li>



<li>BF Pro Challenges: Access to the BF Pro Challenges vault – Unlock exclusive cosmetics from this season’s new BF Pro Challenges. Includes access to previous season(s) BF Pro challenges. Listen to the Pro Radio Station</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s nothing too ‘out there’ on this list. I’m curious how the persistent server hosting would work, as in previous games, players had to <strong>pay </strong>to host private servers like that. Also, the ‘Pro Radio Station’ is interesting as it’s not revealed where that exists or what it includes.</p>



<p>Back in the day, Battlefield Premium was a one-time purchase that unlocked plenty of benefits, but it’s safe to assume that Battlefield Pro will be a monthly or seasonal purchase. Again, it’s unconfirmed at present and should be taken with a pinch of salt.</p>



<p>Would you purchase a subscription to Battlefield Pro? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, Bungie started posting cryptic messages about Marathon on social media. The upcoming extraction shooter has run a little silent in recent months, but something is about to be announced by the developer – we just don’t know what that is.</p>



<p>Marathon is a reboot of a 1994 title of the same name, but this time around, it’s a futuristic extraction shooter – because we just needed <strong>another one of those</strong>, right? </p>



<p>It was recently discovered that some players might be enjoying an alpha version of Marathon <strong>right now</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-are-they-playing-it">Are They Playing It?</h2>



<p>It was noticed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jrnmit/marathon_alpha_test_begins_this_year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eagle-eyed Reddit users</a> that the Marathon Discord server has newly added channels about alpha feedback and discussions. There’s a section for ‘alpha bug reporting’, too. This leads us to believe that the team is either a) preparing to launch an alpha, and that’s the upcoming news, or b) content creators and the like are already enjoying Marathon’s alpha version.</p>



<p>I’d be willing to believe that the former is on the nose. Marathon has been in development for years at this point, and it’s hard to see it not being ready for a good old playtest.</p>



<p>It was suggested on social media that <strong>both </strong>of those possibilities are true. Users were claiming that some Destiny streamers had been granted access to the closed alpha of Marathon, which remains a mystery since its initial reveal in 2023. </p>



<p>It was also recently claimed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie is preparing</a> to make a major announcement regarding Marathon later this month. That’s hardly a leap, given that social media takeovers are happening, and we’re seeing these alpha channels on Discord.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to trying out Marathon? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><span><span>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>On Wednesday evening, the White House announced its upcoming tariff plan, which would impose fees on goods imported from other countries. While the administration has been public about the incoming taxes, the exact rate has turned out to be much higher than anticipated, and in Nintendo's case, it will likely cost them a lot of money. Two common countries where products are manufactured, China and Vietnam, will have tariffs of 54% and 46%, respectively, placed on their exports to the US.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>After the Direct, we learned the base system would cost $449 while the Mario Kart World bundle would be $499, a pair of price tags that staggered many potential buyers. Despite that, Nintendo's delay implies it might raise the price even higher to offset the new tax. Regardless of whether the price will be adjusted, updates on the international trade situation are coming through every day, so Nintendo may also just be waiting for future developments.</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The big news of the week – aside from another ruinous attack from the United States <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/407053/trump-tariff-expensive-democracy-authoritarianism-breakdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on its own economy</a> – was the long-awaited debut of the Nintendo Switch 2. It looks solid, with an intriguing salvo of early games (<em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Donkey Kong</em>, a new FromSoftware game), but <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price tag</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/switch-2-preorder-tariff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder</a> shenanigans left fans wondering if they really <em>need </em>to fork over so much money for what is essentially an incremental upgrade to the first Switch. Now a question looms over the console: Will it be the next ubiquitous Nintendo knock-out hit, or the next Wii U?</p><p>On this episode of Aftermath Hours, we’re joined by special guest Mike Drucker, comedian and writer on shows like <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em>, <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>, and <em>Full Frontal with Samantha Bee</em>, to talk about his new book, <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/good-game-no-rematch-mike-drucker?variant=43103018024994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Good Game, No Rematch: A Life Made of Video Games</em></a>. We discuss how games and people’s relationship to them have changed over the years – and also the time Mike got shot in the dick with a paintball gun while working for Nintendo.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Nintendo, we then move on to the Switch 2, which the company finally revealed in earnest this week with a handful of cool games and a price tag that’s giving would-be buyers serious sticker shock as a result of, well, everything else going on in the world right now. We also put out into the universe the idea of a new DK Rap – but this time they hire a legit rapper and play it totally straight. Please, Nintendo, fulfill our dreams.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make an entire album of DK Raps.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The economy’s a smoking hole in the ground right now. Part of that’s not Nintendo’s fault, but also part of it is Nintendo’s fault because they’re like “Hey, we know you’re gonna do this. You know you’re gonna do this. Let’s just do this.” I don’t know how successful that’s gonna be long-term, particularly when not just Steam but also other console makers want a piece of that really badly. Nintendo will always be the leader, but by how much? And good of a deal is that? If Sony comes out with a handheld tomorrow that’s par-for-par and you can play your PlayStation 5 games on it, that’d be a good deal for a lot of people. That’d be a place where you buy PlayStation games.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, there is the context of, with the Switch and its massive success, Nintendo kind of brought the idea of a handheld back into vogue, and now they’re dealing with the world they created. The Switch 2 is an incremental upgrade that’s not as immediately earthshaking as its predecessor to sort of enter Nintendo back into their own market. And to what extent do they recognize right now that the pitch [in terms of price, at least] isn’t quite as thrilling as it could be? The week before this, they did a big Switch 1 Direct where they were like “Look at all this stuff we still have coming to Switch 1. We have not wound it down quite yet.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s not even just “Will this succeed?” It will succeed, but in my heart of hearts, I think they’re gonna keep up the alternating-console-being-trash streak that they’ve had since the Gamecube. Like, OK, Gamecube sucked. Wii was a hit. Wii U–</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I liked the Gamecube!</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>But it didn’t do [well saleswise]. If you play <em>Smash</em>, it’s fantastic, but relative to its competitors, it was a dud. They fucked up. The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit, and then they’re like “You guys will buy anything.” And then it’s not always the case.</p><p><strong>Mike: </strong>Having been inside there [working at Nintendo of America], I kinda feel sympathy. I know that this is Nintendo of Japan’s decision. I wasn’t there when the Wii U came out, but I was there in some of the naming meetings. And I think the thesis of every naming meeting was “Please don’t call it the Wii U.” And the main response from Japan was “We know what we’re doing. We’re gonna do it. We’re gonna name it the Wii U.” And we were like “OK, we tried.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has returned the boobs to far Cry 4 following a mistake which censored the game worldwide.</p>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-4-censorship-patch-removes-nudity-10-years-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our report earlier today</a> which brought further light to the situation that Ubisoft had apparently censored the nudity in Far Cry 4, the official Far Cry account <a href="https://x.com/FarCrygame/status/1908168738886787356" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">replied to our post</a> to clarify the situation.</p>



<p>“To clarify, the update was the result of a mistake during deployment. Content intended specifically for the Japanese version of the game was accidentally pushed to the global Steam version,” they said.</p>



<p>They continued, “The team has since corrected the error by reuploading the proper global files to Steam. If players are still seeing anything unusual, restarting Steam and checking for updates should resolve it. Just to reassure everyone: there are no plans to censor Far Cry. This was purely a regional packaging error and has now been fully addressed. Thank you“</p>



<p>So fear not, boobs have once again returned to Far Cry 4.</p>



<p>Ubisoft community developer Patricia Brochu-Gagné also took to Reddit to further clarify the situation saying, “This was simply an error tied to a specific regional build, and it’s now been corrected.”</p>



<p>Far Cry 4 went on to sell over 10 million copies during the PlayStation 4 / Xbox One generation and to some, is considered one of the better Far Cry titles in the series. </p>

The Internet, of course, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/you-can-play-as-the-moo-moo-meadows-cow-in-mario-kart-world-and-the-internet-is-thrilled">is thrilled about this</a>, already coming up with dozens of memes and fanart of the adorable Cow that, until recently, was nothing more prominent than a fun background character in a single Mario Kart track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, as news of Cow spread throughout the land, fans began pointing out a potential, erm, problem, with another element of the Mario Kart World reveal. In the Nintendo Direct 2 trailer from Wednesday, Mario eats a burger. Burgers are (typically) made of beef. Would Cow, whose people are ostensibly a source of beef, consume beef herself? Fans really wanted to know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well at the Nintendo preview event, we found out. You see, the food items we saw in the trailer are obtainable in Mario Kart World at Yoshi's diner locations scattered across courses. They function like a drive-thru, allowing racers to drive up and grab a bag of take-out just like they would an item box. There are a lot of different food items that can be inside, including burgers, steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, Cow can eat them all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, Cow CAN eat steak in Mario Kart World. <a href="https://t.co/qN5PZ9IIM4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/qN5PZ9IIM4</a></p>— IGN (@IGN) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGN/status/1908259261769003473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">During our session we also saw Cow eat a number of other items, including the burger. We're still a little hazy on what these items are actually doing for Cow — other racers change costumes when consuming them, but Cow doesn't seem to experience any effects. Could she be eating beef just because she enjoys it? Is there a secret power-up she gets from burger consumption that we just don't know about yet because Nintendo hasn't revealed it? Or perhaps are these veggie burgers and Beyond meat kebabs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Nintendo to try and clear all this up, but we haven't heard back yet. I'm sure it's because they're busy at their New York event, and not because this is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RRyyHsjoU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unhinged question to ask</a> their PR about. Yeah, that's probably it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway go check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">preview of Mario Kart World</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">video version of which</a> features an appearance by our friend Cow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Movie Games has announced that Drug Dealer Simulator will be coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S consoles on April 16, with a PlayStation 5 release to come at a later date.</p>



<p>In the new press release, it was said that Drug Dealer Simulator has already surpassed over “1 million buyers” on PC – a total amounting to some $16 million in revenue.</p>



<p>Originally, the announcement was made a few weeks ago, but the recent PR email seems, at least at face value, that they are also trying to capitalise on the highly-successful Schedule 1. </p>



<p>Schedule 1 released on March 29, and recently hit a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-is-a-sleeper-indie-hit-dominating-steam-with-nearly-half-a-million-concurrent-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak concurrent playercount of 414,000</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 329,000 concurrent players at the time of writing. At the moment, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-schedule-1-on-playstation-or-xbox-console-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Schedule 1 is yet to announce a console release</a>, so it makes sense that a rival drug dealer simulator would try and get ahead with an Xbox and PlayStation release… I guess.</p>

Fans obsessively tuned into every Nintendo presentation hoping for an update on the game to no avail until 2024 when a trailer was finally released and footage of the game in motion was actually revealed. This year, not only is Metroid Prime 4: Beyond getting released but it’s also getting some really interesting visual and gameplay upgrades on Nintendo Switch 2. We’ve played Retro Studio’s latest installment in the classic sci-fi action adventure series on Switch 2 and we have lots to tell you about. Read on to find out more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Beyond Beautiful</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The first thing we noticed with Metroid Prime 4 was how gorgeous it was. It’s got an incredibly clean and stylish aesthetic and Nintendo was advertising it as running in 120 frames per second on Switch 2. This won’t be the case on Switch 1 and it’s tough to track how much Nintendo will be able to stick to that number on the full game, but it’s an ambitious goal either way. So far, Prime 4 has a really great sense of scale. We fought a bunch of grunt-like enemies, saw a massive, hulking mech strut into the battle, and then took down a large boss that featured several different attack phases. The area we demoed was just a small glimpse at what the full game might offer so we’re hoping we see some grander setpieces and large, open environments, some of which have been teased already in trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Metroid games are also about cramped tunnels and dark corridors and we got to see a few of those, too. Like previous Prime games, a quick button press instantly pops Samus from first-person aiming into third-person morph ball mode, allowing her to traverse some areas she can’t reach otherwise. We got to test this out a bit and it works great so we can’t wait to search around every nook and cranny of this game looking for missile upgrades, energy tanks, shortcuts, and more. This is the most detailed Metroid game yet and these sections are no different, giving us a glimpse of battles happening between warring factions happening beneath you as you roll around in tunnels above them. But wait, how does it all play?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Samouse Aran (Or, Of Mice and Metroids)</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most fascinating additions to Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 is the optional mouse controls. Looking back, the Prime series has experimented a ton with unique control options across various games. The first two Metroid Prime games were built around the fairly traditional Nintendo GameCube controller (although there was nothing traditional about turning a historically 2D sidescrolling game into a first person action adventure game with third person ball rolling mechanics) but after that, all bets were off. Metroid Prime: Hunters on Nintendo DS had touch screen controls. Metroid Prime 3 on Nintendo Wii had pointer and motion controls. Metroid Prime Pinball on DS shipped with a Game Boy Advance cartridge shaped rumble pack. We don’t talk about Metroid Prime: Blast Ball on Nintendo 3DS. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, Metroid Prime 4 on Switch 2 lets you turn your right Joy-Con 2 sideways, place it on a flat surface, and control Samus’ aiming with a snappy and precise mouse pointer complete with haptic feedback for every shot. Even neater, the game seamlessly allows you to switch from traditional stick controls to mouse controls on a whim, with no need to pause to go into the settings. We could see plenty of people deciding this is their preferred way to play Metroid Prime 4, and the ease of which you can swap back and forth between mouse and pointer controls makes it so you can choose to only plop the Joy-Con 2 on the table when it’s time for a serious combat sequence, and use traditional controls for the more chill exploration segments Prime 4 will surely deliver. Or maybe you’ll want to play the whole game in handheld mode or with a Pro Controller. Either way, you’ve got options.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct April 2025 Games</h3><p>Every game shown in Nintendo's April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 reveal direct event.</p></div><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The "Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" Upgrade Path</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing Nintendo isn’t being totally clear on just yet is where Prime 4 sits in their awkward transitional Switch 1 to Switch 2 titles list. While some original Switch games like Echoes of Wisdom and Link’s Awakening are getting free upgrade patches for Switch 2, others like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are charging $10 for visual upgrades (and a few bells and whistles) while some games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land will receive $20 upgrades that improve visuals and add new content. Which of these categories will Metroid Prime 4’s mouse controls and 120FPS options be in when they come to Switch 2? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, like its release date and base game price, we just don’t know yet. You’ll be able to buy the base game and the “Switch 2 edition upgrade pack” individually or as a bundle in a bright red Switch 2 branded box but as of now, we have no idea how much any of those will cost you. Our best guess is that it will be $10 more for the Switch 2 version given that it’s not coming with an expansion like Mario Party’s “+ Jamboree TV” and Kirby’s “+ Star-Crossed World”, but we’re not 100% sure yet. Samus has unlockable psychic powers in Prime 4 so we might just have to ask her. She’s usually not very talkative, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4 doesn’t have a release date just yet but it’s coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 in 2025 so hey, at least we won’t have to wait seven years again to find out more.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At GDC 2025, I watched a walkthrough of one of the early levels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>, the next game from Heart Machine. The studio typically goes for action games but mixes in a little bit of something else--2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a> had RPG elements, 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solar-ash/" data-ref-id="5000-505771">Solar Ash</a> was an adventure-platformer, and 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-breaker/" data-ref-id="5000-561878">Hyper Light Breaker</a> is a cooperative roguelike. Possessor(s) is a metroidvania or, as Heart Machine prefers to call it, a search-action game (which, honestly, is such a better term for the genre).</p><p dir="ltr">A sidescroller, Possessor(s) sees you play as two characters: Luca, a teenage girl, and Rehm, the demon possessing her. I didn't get to see the events that led to their partnership, but the Heart Machine team explained that the start of Possessor(s) sees Luca caught up in an interdimensional catastrophe that rips a hole in the sky and kills everyone she loves--it's only because of the intervention of the strange horned man now within her that she survives.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471289"></a><figcaption>During Luca and Rehm's journey, they'll encounter objects possessed by feral demons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471289-ss_03a9571625dd87e99bb8b9e0482852aad5d0b743.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rehm also gives Luca artificial legs (I don't know what happened to her original legs, but I assume the full game will clue us in), so that she can jump higher and survive falls from any height, and Luca uses these new prosthetics to navigate the now-quarantined city in hopes of escaping it and learning more about how the catastrophe happened. The duo regularly converse about their substantially different views of demons and the corporation responsible for most everything in the city, alleviating much of the sense of loneliness that I've come to expect in other search-action games.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Rehm, Luca is able to hold her own in a world that wants to kill her. Combat is against the possessed objects and people of the city--demons far more feral than Rehm have corrupted all manner of things in the metropolis. I was surprised when a potted plant that had been pretending to be totally inanimate and harmless sprung to life right as Luca walked past it, and the devs said that plenty of demons will adopt that strategy of hiding in plain sight by pretending to be seemingly normal parts of the world. When a fight does break out, mechanically, it looks a whole lot like playing Super Smash Bros., with an emphasis on combos and air juggles. It looks more engaging than Hyper Light Breaker, but I didn't get hands-on time with Possessor(s) so I can't say one way or the other for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471290"></a><figcaption>As Luca unlocks new traversal abilities, she and Rehm will be able to reach more areas of the map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4471290-ss_8e6834f6fd26deb93548150c5ef502355d63a63d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like its genre contemporaries, Luca unlocks additional abilities over time, which open up new options in combat and open up new areas of the map. I didn't get a chance to see this in action, but it sounds like it works just like how upgrades are handled in the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nine-sols/" data-ref-id="5000-548741">Nine Sols</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-metroid/" data-ref-id="5000-17693">Super Metroid</a>, and other similar games, with an open-ended, interconnected world that allows players to explore in whichever direction they have access to.</p><p dir="ltr">Stylistically, Possessor(s) is the biggest departure from Hyper Light Drifter's visuals--not bad by any means, but surprising all the same since every subsequent game from the studio has followed that art direction pretty closely. The colors are certainly similar, but Possessor(s)'s characters look hand-drawn, and bolder lines and flashier colors for the animations make attacks and movements appear like something from a comic book or manga. It's very cool, and at least in terms of art direction, Possessor(s) is my favorite of Heart Machine's games. It wasn't at all what I was expecting, but the game intrigues me all the same, and I can't wait to jump into it myself later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) is set to launch for PS5 and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

          <p>This morning's announcement that Nintendo is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-to-assess-trump-tariff-effects/">delaying US preorders for the Switch 2</a> immediately increased the salience of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">President Trump's proposed wide-reaching import tariffs</a> for millions of American Nintendo fans. Additionally, the Entertainment Software Association—a lobbying group that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">represents the game industry's interests</a> in Washington—is warning that the effects of Trump's tariffs on the gaming world won't stop with Nintendo.</p>
<p>"There are so many devices we play video games on," ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/esa-responds-to-trump-tariffs-if-we-think-its-just-the-switch-2-then-we-arent-taking-it-seriously">said in an interview with IGN</a> just as Nintendo's preorder delay news broke. "There are other consoles... VR headsets, our smartphones, people who love PC games; if we think it's just the Switch, then we aren't taking it seriously.</p>
<p>"This is company-agnostic, this is an entire industry," she continued. "There's going to be an impact on the entire industry."</p>
<p>While Trump's tariff proposal includes a 10 percent tax on imports from pretty much every country, it also includes a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and a 54 percent total tariff on China, the two countries where most console hardware is produced. Quinn told IGN that it's "hard to imagine a world where tariffs like these don’t impact pricing" for those consoles.</p>
<p>More than that, though, Quinn warns that massive tariffs would tamp down overall consumer spending, which would have knock-on effects for game industry revenues, employment, and research and development investment.</p>
<p>"Video game consoles are sold under tight margins in order to reduce the barrier to entry for consumers," the ESA notes in <a href="https://www.theesa.com/issues/tariffs/">its issue page on tariffs</a>. "Tariffs mean that the additional costs would be passed along to consumers, resulting in a ripple effect of harm for the industry and the jobs it generates and supports.</p>
<h2>Not just a foreign problem</h2>
<p>The negative impacts wouldn't be limited to foreign companies like Nintendo, Quinn warned, because "even American-based companies, they're getting products that need to cross into American borders to make those consoles, to make those games. And so there's going to be a real impact regardless of company."</p>
